to Trademark Infringement and Related Limitations on Trademark Rights</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc392010402"><a name="_Toc371340326">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descriptive
Fair Use</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a typical descriptive fair use situation, the plaintiff
uses a term as a trademark (e.g., <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>sweetarts</span>
for candy) that the defendant also uses merely to describe its own goods (e.g.,
�sweet-tart� to describe the taste of <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>ocean
spray</span> cranberry juice).&nbsp; <i>See Sunmark, Inc. v. Ocean Spray
Cranberries, Inc</i>., 64 F.3d 1055 (7th Cir. 1995) (finding defendant�s
descriptive, non-trademark use of the term �sweet-tart� to be a descriptive
fair use).&nbsp;&nbsp; The affirmative defense of descriptive fair use
(sometimes called �classic� fair use) &nbsp;is based on Lanham Act � �
33(b)(4), 15 U.S.C. � 1115(b)(4), which establishes a defense to trademark
infringement on the ground: </p>

<p class=Blockquote>(4) That the use of the name, term, or device charged to be
an infringement is a use, otherwise than as a mark, of the party�s individual
name in his own business, or of the individual name of anyone in privity with
such party, or of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and
in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party, or their geographic
origin;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We begin our review of descriptive fair use in Part III.A.1 with
<i>KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc</i>., 543 U.S. 111
(2004).&nbsp; Note importantly that in adjudicating descriptive fair use
claims, most circuits do not seek to apply whatever test the Supreme Court may
have proposed in <i>KP Permanent</i>.&nbsp; The opinion is included here
primarily because of the importance of the Court�s clear holding that a court
may find the defendant�s conduct to be a descriptive fair use even if that
conduct causes some degree of consumer confusion as to source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We then turn In Part III.A.2 to the basic three-step test
that most courts apply to evaluate a claim of descriptive fair use.&nbsp; We
consider two cases.&nbsp; The first, <i>Dessert Beauty, Inc. v. Fox</i>, 568
F.Supp.2d 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), was a relatively easy case of clear descriptive
fair use; it is included here as a simple example of the application of the three-step
test and as a foundation for our consideration of our second case, <i>Kelly-Brown
v. Winfrey</i>, 717 F.3d 295 (2d Cir. 2013).&nbsp; At the district court, <i>Kelly-Brown</i>
also appeared to be a slam-dunk case of descriptive fair use, so much so that
the district court granted the defendant�s motion to dismiss in a brief opinion.&nbsp;
<i>Kelly-Brown v. Winfrey</i>, No. 11 Civ. 7875, 2012 WL 701262 (S.D.N.Y. March
6, 2012).&nbsp; On appeal, the Second Circuit provided a much richer
description of the facts, which triggered in turn a considerably more difficult
descriptive fair use analysis (and a reversal).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392010403">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descriptive Fair
Use and Consumer Confusion</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>KP Permanent</i>, the declaratory plaintiff used the
term �microcolor� in advertisements for its �permanent makeup� (shown below on
the left).&nbsp; The defendant had previously registered the trademark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>micro colors</span> at the PTO (on the right).&nbsp;
In the excerpt that follows, the Supreme Court finally overruled the Ninth
Circuit�s bizarre doctrine that any likelihood of consumer confusion defeats a
defense of descriptive fair use.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>SOUTER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in

JJ., joined, in which SCALIA, J., joined as to all but footnotes 4 and 5
[footnotes 1 and 2 in this excerpt], and in which BREYER, J., joined as to all

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On appeal, 328 F.3d 1061 (2003), the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thought it was error for the District Court to
have addressed the fair use defense without delving into the matter of possible
confusion on the part of consumers about the origin of KP�s goods. The
reviewing court took the view that no use could be recognized as fair where any
consumer confusion was probable, and although the court did not pointedly
address the burden of proof, it appears to have placed it on KP to show absence
of consumer confusion. <i>Id.,</i> at 1072 (�Therefore, KP can only benefit
from the fair use defense if there is no likelihood of confusion between KP�s
use of the term �micro color� and Lasting�s mark�). Since it found there were
disputed material facts relevant under the Circuit�s eight-factor test for
assessing the likelihood of confusion, it reversed the summary judgment and
remanded the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We granted KP�s petition for certiorari, 540 U.S.
1099 (2004), to address a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals on the
significance of likely confusion for a fair use defense to a trademark
infringement claim, and the obligation of a party defending on that ground to
show that its use is unlikely to cause consumer confusion. Compare 328 F.3d, at
1072 (likelihood of confusion bars the fair use defense); <i>PACCAR Inc. v.
TeleScan Technologies, L.L.C.,</i> 319 F.3d 243, 256 (C.A.6 2003) (�[A] finding
of a likelihood of confusion forecloses a fair use defense�); and <i>Zatarains,
Inc. v. Oak Grove Smokehouse, Inc.,</i> 698 F.2d 786, 796 (C.A.5 1983) (alleged
infringers were free to use words contained in a trademark �in their ordinary,
descriptive sense, so long as such use [did] not tend to confuse customers as
to the source of the goods�), with <i>Cosmetically Sealed Industries, Inc. v.
Chesebrough&#8211;Pond�s USA Co.,</i> 125 F.3d 28, 30&#8211;31 (C.A.2 1997)
(the fair use defense may succeed even if there is likelihood <a
name="co_pp_sp_780_117_1"></a>of confusion); <i>Shakespeare Co. v. Silstar
Corp. of Am., Inc.,</i> 110 F.3d 234, 243 (C.A.4 1997) (�[A] determination of
likely confusion [does not] preclud[e] considering the fairness of use�); <i>Sunmark,
Inc. v. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.,</i> 64 F.3d 1055, 1059 (C.A.7 1995)
(finding that likelihood of confusion did not preclude the fair use defense).
We now vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent align=center style='text-align:center'>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Two points are evident [from this review of the
relevant statutory sections]. Section 1115(b) places a burden of proving
likelihood of confusion (that is, infringement) on the party charging
infringement even when relying on an incontestable registration. And Congress
said nothing about likelihood of confusion in setting out the elements of the
fair use defense in � 1115(b)(4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starting from these textual fixed points, it takes
a long stretch to claim that a defense of fair use entails any burden to negate
confusion. It is just not plausible that Congress would have used the
descriptive phrase �likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive�
in � 1114 to describe the requirement that a markholder show likelihood of
consumer confusion, but would have relied on the phrase �used fairly� in �
1115(b)(4) in a fit of terse drafting meant to place a defendant under a burden
to negate confusion. � �[W]here Congress includes particular language in one
section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is
generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the
disparate inclusion or exclusion.� � <i>Russello v. United States,</i> 464 U.S.

do we find much force in Lasting�s suggestion that �used fairly� in �
1115(b)(4) is an oblique incorporation of a likelihood-of-confusion test
developed in the common law of unfair competition. Lasting is certainly correct
that some unfair competition cases would stress that use of a term by another
in conducting its trade went too far in sowing confusion, and would either
enjoin the use or order the defendant to include a disclaimer. See, <i>e.g.,
Baglin v. Cusenier Co.,</i> 221 U.S. 580, 602 (1911) (�[W]e are unable to
escape the conclusion that such use, in the manner shown, was to serve the
purpose of simulation ...�); <i>Herring&#8211;Hall&#8211;Marvin Safe Co. v.
Hall�s Safe Co.,</i> 208 U.S. 554, 559 (1908) (�[T]he rights of the two parties
have been reconciled by allowing the use, provided that an explanation is
attached�). But the common law of unfair competition also tolerated some degree
of confusion from a descriptive use of words contained in another person�s
trademark. See, <i>e.g., William R. Warner &amp; Co. v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.,</i>
265 U.S. 526, 528 (1924) (as to plaintiff�s trademark claim, �[t]he use of a
similar name by another to truthfully describe his own product does not
constitute a legal or <a name="co_pp_sp_708_549_1"></a>moral wrong, even if its
effect be to cause the public to mistake the origin or ownership of the
product�); <i>Canal Co. v. Clark,</i> 13 Wall. 311, 327, 20 L.Ed. 581 (1872)
(�Purchasers may be mistaken, but they are not deceived by false
representations, and equity will not enjoin against telling the truth�); see
also 3 L. Altman, Callmann on Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies �
18:2, pp. 18&#8211;8 to 18&#8211;9, n. 1 (4th ed.2004) (citing cases). While
these cases are consistent with taking account of the likelihood of consumer
confusion as one consideration in deciding whether a use is fair, see Part
II&#8211;B, <i>infra,</i> they do not stand for the proposition that an
assessment of <a name="co_pp_sp_780_120_1"></a>confusion alone may be
dispositive. Certainly one cannot get out of them any defense burden to negate
it entirely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, a look at the typical course of litigation
in an infringement action points up the incoherence of placing a burden to show
nonconfusion on a defendant. If a plaintiff succeeds in making out a prima
facie case of trademark infringement, including the element of likelihood of
consumer confusion, the defendant may offer rebutting evidence to undercut the
force of the plaintiff�s evidence on this (or any) element, or raise an
affirmative defense to bar relief even if the prima facie case is sound, or do
both. But it would make no sense to give the defendant a defense of showing
affirmatively that the plaintiff cannot succeed in proving some element (like
confusion); all the defendant needs to do is to leave the factfinder
unpersuaded that the plaintiff has carried its own burden on that point. A
defendant has no need of a court�s true belief when agnosticism will do. Put
another way, it is only when a plaintiff has shown likely confusion by a
preponderance of the evidence that a defendant could have any need of an
affirmative defense, but under Lasting�s theory the defense would be foreclosed
in such a case. �[I]t defies logic to argue that a defense may not be asserted
in the only situation where it even becomes relevant.� <i>Shakespeare Co. v.
Silstar Corp.,</i> 110 F.3d, at 243. Nor would it make sense to provide an
affirmative defense of no confusion plus good faith, when merely rebutting the
plaintiff�s case on confusion would entitle the defendant to judgment, good
faith or not.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> Since the burden of proving likelihood of confusion
rests with the plaintiff, and the fair use defendant has no free-standing need
to show confusion unlikely, it follows (contrary to the Court of Appeals�s
view) that some possibility of consumer confusion must be compatible with fair
use, and so it <a name="co_pp_sp_780_122_1"></a>is. The common law�s tolerance
of a certain degree of confusion on the part of consumers followed from the
very fact that in cases like this one an originally descriptive term was
selected to be used as a mark, not to mention the undesirability of allowing
anyone to obtain a complete monopoly on use of a descriptive term simply by
grabbing it first. <i>Canal Co. v. Clark,</i> 13 Wall., at 323&#8211;324, 327.
The Lanham Act adopts a similar leniency, there being no indication that the
statute was meant to deprive commercial speakers of the ordinary utility of
descriptive words. �If any confusion results, that is a risk the plaintiff
accepted when it decided to identify its product with a mark that uses a well
known descriptive phrase.� <i>Cosmetically Sealed Industries, Inc. v.
Chesebrough&#8211;Pond�s USA Co.,</i> 125 F.3d, at 30. See also <i>Park �N Fly,

reason that descriptive terms qualify for registration as trademarks only after
taking on secondary meaning as �distinctive of the applicant�s goods,� 15
U.S.C. � 1052(f), with the registrant getting an exclusive right not in the
original, descriptive sense, but only in the secondary one associated with the
markholder�s goods, 2 McCarthy, <i>supra,</i> � 11:45, p. 11&#8211;90 (�The

style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> While
we thus recognize that mere risk of confusion will not rule out fair use, we
think it would be improvident to go further in this case, for deciding anything
more would take us beyond the Ninth Circuit�s consideration of the subject. It
suffices to realize that our holding that fair use can occur along with some
degree of confusion does not foreclose the relevance of the extent of any
likely consumer confusion in assessing whether a defendant�s use is objectively
fair. Two Courts of Appeals have found it relevant to consider such scope, and
commentators and <i>amici</i> here have urged us to say that the degree <a
name="co_pp_sp_708_551_1"></a>of likely consumer confusion bears not only on
the fairness of using a term, but even on the further question whether an
originally descriptive term has become so identified as a mark that a
defendant�s use of it cannot realistically be called descriptive. See <i>Shakespeare
Co. v. Silstar Corp.,</i> 110 F.3d, at 243 (�[T]o the degree that confusion is
likely, a use is less likely to be found fair ...� (emphasis deleted)); <i>Sunmark,

degree of consumer confusion under the fair use defense, we likewise do not
pass upon the position of the United States, as <i>amicus,</i> that the �used
fairly� requirement in � 1115(b)(4) demands only that the descriptive term
describe the goods accurately. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. Accuracy of course has to
be a consideration in assessing fair use, but the proceedings in this case so
far raise no occasion to evaluate some other concerns that courts might pick as
relevant, quite apart from attention to confusion. The Restatement raises
possibilities like commercial justification and the strength of the plaintiff�s
mark. Restatement � 28. As to them, it is enough to say here that the door is

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span

�love potion.� Defendant and third-party plaintiff Mara Fox registered the
trademark LOVE POTION for perfumed essential oils in 1995 and filed a
declaration of incontestability for the LOVE POTION mark in 2001. In 2004,
plaintiff Dessert Beauty, Inc. (�DBI�) launched a line of beauty products that
included two fragrance products described as �love potion fragrance� and �belly
button love potion fragrance.� At issue is whether DBI�s use of the words �love
potion� infringed Fox�s LOVE POTION trademark, or whether the use was fair use,
immune from liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DBI seeks a declaratory judgment that it did not
violate Fox�s trademark; it also seeks to cancel the LOVE POTION trademark

style='color:gray'>]</span> The parties cross-move for summary judgment. For
the reasons that follow, I conclude that DBI�s use of �love potion� constituted
fair use. Thus, DBI�s motion is granted to the extent that judgment will be
entered declaring that DBI did not engage in trademark infringement�.</p>

Fox�s Love Potion Perfume</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox created the �Love Potion Perfume� in 1990. In
1995, she registered the words �love potion� for �perfumed essential oils for
personal use� with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (�USPTO�). In 2001, Fox
filed a declaration of incontestability with the USPTO for the mark LOVE
POTION.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 2004, DBI launched a line of beauty products
that were endorsed by celebrity Jessica Simpson. As part of DBI�s advertising
and marketing campaign, Simpson told the story that �every time [her then
husband] would kiss [her] lips or skin, he would taste [her] lipstick, body
lotion, and perfume&#8212;and hate it.� Thus, the DBI products were created to
�smell and taste good� and were advertised as �lickable, tasteable, and ...
kissable.� Products such as the �Whipped Body Cream with Candy Sprinkles,� �Chocolicious
Body Gloss,� and �Powdered Sugar Body Shimmer� were named after ingredients
used to make desserts to suggest their �edible nature.�<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

products available in the Dessert Beauty line, such as �Bath Bubbles� and
�Sugar Scrub.� Two fragrance products are included. The �Love Potion Fragrance�
was offered in three varieties: �Creamy, Juicy &amp; <a
name="co_pp_sp_4637_421_1"></a>Dreamy.� The �Belly Button Love Potion
Fragrance,� offered in �Creamy� and �Juicy,� was intended to be applied to the
navel and sold in a �roll-on� container. &nbsp;The packages and bottles
referred to the fragrance products as the �deliciously kissable love potion
fragrance� or the �deliciously kissable belly button love potion.�</p>

such by the trademark symbol �TM� next to the word �Dessert� on all of its
packaging and advertising materials. Its logo consisted of a pink lipstick
stain and the mark DESSERT inside a black circle. Beneath the circle was the
phrase �Sexy Girls Have Dessert� in script. The DESSERT trademark, in
conjunction with the lipstick stain logo and catch phrase (the DBI �indicia�),
was displayed prominently on every DBI product and used in all advertising
materials.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. Fox�s Actions to Protect Her Trademark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox�s lawyer routinely issued cease and desist
letters to manufacturers and retailers that sold perfume products containing
the term �love potion.� The record contains approximately 80 such letters sent
to different vendors between 2000 and 2006.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;After learning in April 2004 that DBI was
using the words �love potion� for its fragrance products, Fox�s lawyer demanded
that Randi Schinder, co-creator of the Dessert Beauty products, and David
Suliteanu, president of Sephora USA LLC, �[c]ease and desist from any further
use of the [LOVE POTION] mark� and �[p]rovide<a name="co_pp_sp_4637_422_1"></a>
an accounting of any and all sales made to date.� DBI�s lawyer, on behalf of
both DBI and Sephora, responded in a letter dated April 23, 2004, stating that
DBI�s �use of the term �love potion� is fair use within � 33(b)(4) of the
Lanham Act.� After exchanging several letters regarding whether DBI�s use of
�love potion� was fair use, DBI voluntarily agreed to �cease and desist from
the use of the term �love potion,� � �change its website as soon as possible,�
and �delete the term �love potion� from all bottles, packaging and
advertising.� DBI steadfastly maintained, however, that its �use of �love
potion� in phrases like �deliciously kissable love potion fragrance� [was]
merely descr[i]ptive.� Despite DBI�s agreement not to use �love potion,� the
parties continued to dispute the sufficiency of DBI�s actions in removing the
words �love potion� from its fragrance products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to direct communication with DBI and
Sephora, Fox filed a report with eBay�s Verified Rights Owner (�VeRO�) Program,
which allows intellectual property owners to flag listings on eBay that
purportedly infringe their trademark rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox also waged a public campaign on her website,
which contained the following message:</p>

TRADEMARKS AGAINST A CORPORATION THAT THINKS THEY CAN BULLY U.S. BECAUSE THEY

<p class=NormalNoIndent><a name="co_footnoteReference_B00442016668829_ID0"></a>She
hired a public relations company, which issued a press release in January 2006
about this lawsuit and DBI�s alleged infringement of Fox�s trademark. The press
release, quoting Fox�s third-party complaint, stated that DBI �willfully and
maliciously initiate[d] a campaign to flood the major internet search engines
with key word spamming to direct any inquiries of LOVE POTION to their
retailers.� Fox was quoted, stating that �in the first month following [DBI]�s
launch, her sales were reduced by 96%. The following month, they were down
97%.� (<i>Id.</i>). The press release also indicated that DBI �reported sales
exceeding $120 million dollars.� This press release was reported by numerous
media publications, including the New York Post, which wrote that �the bimbonic
blonde and her business partners ripped off [Fox�s] trademarked cosmetics
brand.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. Procedural History</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DBI commenced this action against Fox and Love
Potion LLC for: (1) a judgment declaring that DBI did not infringe Fox�s
trademark, (2) cancellation of Fox�s LOVE POTION registration�. Fox filed
counterclaims against DBI�asserting: (1) trademark infringement under the
Lanham Act and state law, (2) false designation of origin under the Lanham Act�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both parties now cross-move for summary judgment.
DBI and Sephora move again to dismiss Fox�s remaining claims on the ground that
there is no trademark infringement or, in the alternative, that DBI�s use of
the term �love potion� is fair use. Fox moves to dismiss DBI�s complaint in its
entirety. I heard argument on July 15, 2008 and reserved decision.</p>

Non&#8211;Trademark Use</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A trademark use occurs when a mark indicates the
source or origin of consumer products. <i>See Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. v.
Nature Labs, LLC,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d 410, 414 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (defining
non-trademark use in the context of trademark parody). Here, DBI did not use
�love potion� as a trademark because the source of its fragrance products was
not identified by that term. Instead, the source was indicated by its own
trademark DESSERT in conjunction with the lip stain logo and catch phrase �Sexy
Girls Have Dessert,� which were prominently displayed on all DBI products.
Words on a product�s packaging generally do not serve as a trademark where
there is also a conspicuously visible trademark that clearly serves that
function. <i>See Cosmetically Sealed,</i> 125 F.3d at 30&#8211;31 (the
�non-trademark use of the challenged phrase [is] evidenced by the fact that the
source of [plaintiffs�] product is clearly identified by the prominent display
of [their] own trademarks�). Moreover, DBI placed a TM symbol only next to the
word �Dessert,� highlighting the non-trademark use of �love potion.� The TM
symbol was not placed next to the words �love potion.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, DBI used the words �love potion� within
the phrase �Love Potion Fragrance� or �Belly Button Love Potion Fragrance� to
identify particular products within the DBI line. These names are listed in the
�Menu� of beauty products along with the descriptive or generic names of other
products such as �Bath Bubbles� and �Sugar Scrub.� The product names served to
distinguish the love potion fragrance products from other DBI products rather
than to distinguish them from non-DBI products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B62016668829_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox argues that a product name can constitute
trademark use. Product names, however, generally do not amount to trademark use
because such names, as a �common descriptive name of a product,� are generic, <i>San
Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Comm.,</i> 483 U.S. 522,
532 n. 7 (1987), and generic terms cannot be trademarked under the Lanham Act, <i>see,
e.g., PaperCutter, Inc. v. Fay�s Drug Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 558, 562 (2d Cir.1990).
Product names identify a category or class of goods, but do not indicate the
source of the goods. For instance, �perfume� is a product name that indicates
that the product emits a fragrant scent when sprayed, but the word �perfume�
does not indicate who manufactured the particular product. Accordingly, at
least two courts in this Circuit have held that �regardless of whether or not a
person knows that [a given word] is a trade-mark, if he uses the trade-mark
word as the name of the product, it is used in a descriptive sense and is
therefore generic.� <i>Am. Thermos Prods. Co. v. Aladdin Indus., Inc.,</i> 207
F.Supp. 9, 20 (D.C.Conn.1962); <i>see also W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Union
Carbide Corp.,</i> 581 F.Supp. 148, 154&#8211;55 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (holding that a
product name is not a trademark use, but is generic). Hence, because DBI used
the words �love potion� not to describe the source of the product but as a
product name in a generic, descriptive sense, the use was not trademark use.</p>

Descriptive Use</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox argues that �love potion� can never be used in
a descriptive sense when referring to perfume products because �love potion� is
�a liquid consumable that is drunk� and �has not been used in its common
parlance to describe [or] refer to a fragrance.� Fox thus raises the question
whether the term �love potion� can describe a product that is not, in
actuality, a love potion. I conclude that it may for purposes of the fair use
defense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_4637_425_1"></a><a
name="co_anchor_B72016668829_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> A
use of a mark is descriptive if �the words were used to describe the
�ingredients, quality or composition� of a product, not the source of the
product.� <i>JA Apparel Corp. v. Abboud,</i> No. 07 Civ. 7787(THK), 2008 WL
2329533, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. Jun.5, 2008) (citing <i>In Re Colonial Stores Inc.,</i>
55 C.C.P.A. 1049, 394 F.2d 549, 551 (C.C.P.A.1968)). Though the Lanham Act
recognizes the fair use defense where the name or term is used �to describe the
goods,� � 1115(b)(4), the Second Circuit has explained that the statute �has
not been narrowly confined to words that describe a characteristic of the
goods, such as size or quality. Instead, [the Second Circuit has] recognized
that the phrase permits use of words or images that are used, in Judge Leval�s
helpful expression, in their �descriptive sense.� � <i>Cosmetically Sealed,</i>
125 F.3d at 30 (citing <i>Car&#8211;Freshner Corp. v. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son,
Inc.,</i> 70 F.3d 267, 269 (2d Cir.1995)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For instance, the Second Circuit has held the fair
use defense applicable to a clothing manufacturer�s use of the phrase �Come on
Strong� as �describing a presumably desirable effect� of its menswear, even
though articles of clothing do not literally �come on strong.� <i>B &amp; L
Sales Assocs. v. H. Daroff &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 421 F.2d 352, 354 (2d
Cir.1970). The Second Circuit has also held that even though �the words �Seal
it with a Kiss� do not describe a characteristic of the defendants� [lipstick],
they surely are used in their �descriptive sense�&#8212;to describe an action
that the sellers hope consumers will take, using their product.�� <i>Cosmetically
Sealed,</i> 125 F.3d at 30. In <i>Jean Patou, Inc. v. Jacqueline Cochran, Inc.,</i>
201 F.Supp. 861 (S.D.N.Y.1962), <i>aff�d,</i> 312 F.2d 125 (2d Cir.1963), the
plaintiff was the owner of the registered trademark JOY for use on perfumes and
sought to enjoin the defendant from using the phrase �Joy of Bathing� on its
bath products. But the court concluded that the challenged phrase was �designed
to suggest the pleasure which will accompany the use of defendant�s product in
one�s bath, and thus performs a descriptive function.� <i>Jean Patou,</i> 201
F.Supp. at 865. Accordingly, when determining whether a use is descriptive,
courts in the Second Circuit consider not only �whether the mark used describes
certain aspects of the alleged infringer�s own goods,� but also �whether the
mark as used describes an action the alleged infringer hopes consumers will
make of its product.� <i>EMI Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 64&#8211;65.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Viewed in this broad sense, it is clear that DBI
used �love potion� descriptively. First, the words, by themselves, are
descriptive. Dictionary.com defines �love potion� as a product �believed to arouse
love or sexual passion toward a specified person.� <i>See Radio Channel
Networks, Inc. v. Broadcast.Com, Inc.,</i> No. 98 Civ. 4799(RPP), 1999 WL
124455, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.8, 1999) (consulting dictionary definitions when
determining whether term �radio channel� was used in the descriptive sense).
Although the words �love potion� do not describe an actual quality of DBI�s
fragrance products, they are used to describe the effects that the products may
have on whoever �kisses� or �tastes� the products worn by the wearer, or at
least to describe the purpose with which consumers will use the product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, the term �love potion� is a common term in
the English language. The very fact that �love potion� is defined in several
dictionaries as a product used for the purpose of attracting the opposite sex
reflects the ordinary usage of the term to describe products used for those
purposes. Moreover, the record contains approximately 80 cease and desist letters
that were sent by Fox, indicating that �love potion� was commonly used by many
sellers in the cosmetics industry to describe a product�s purported effect on
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_4637_426_1"></a><a
name="co_anchor_B82016668829_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Third,
that many merchants received warning letters from Fox for using �love potion�
demonstrates that there is no other reasonably available word to describe the
meaning captured by the term �love potion,� namely, that the opposite sex will
be attracted to the wearer of the product. Descriptive use is evident in such
situations �[w]here a mark incorporates a term that is the only reasonably
available means of describing a characteristic of another�s goods.� <i>EMI
Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 65; <i>see also New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ�g,
Inc.,</i> 971 F.2d 302, 308 (9th Cir.1992); 2 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition � 10:14 (4th Ed.1999) (�Since the use of a descriptive title cannot
serve to prevent others from using the title in a descriptive, non-trademark
sense, others may be able to use the title as the only term available.�). �To
expect [plaintiffs] to use unwieldy or long terms would be contrary to the
purpose of the fair use defense, [and Fox] cannot monopolize words and images
that are used descriptively.� <i>Something Old,</i> 1999 WL 1125063, at *7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B92016668829_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, descriptive use is often evident in the
manner of use, such as the �physical nature of the use in terms of size,
location, and other characteristics in comparison with the appearance of other
descriptive matter or other trademarks,� <i>EMI Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 65
(quoting Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition � 28 cmt. c. (1995)), as
well as �the presence of the defendant�s own trademark in conjunction with the
descriptive term,� � 28 cmt. c; <i>see also Something Old,</i> 1999 WL 1125063,
at *6 (�In determining descriptive use, the total context of the allegedly
infringing term is considered, including lettering, type style, size and
placement.�). The factors noted above that indicated non-trademark
usage&#8212;such as the prominent use of the DESSERT brand name&#8212;also
demonstrate DBI�s descriptive use of �love potion.� For instance, the presence
of a TM symbol next to DESSERT, contrasted with the absence of the symbol next to
the words �love potion,� suggests not only that �love potion� on the DBI
products was a non-trademark use, but also that it constituted descriptive use.
Moreover, on all the packaging, the words �love potion� were placed off-center
and printed in a smaller font size than the trademark DESSERT. Most indicative
of descriptive use is that �love potion� was used with other words to form a
phrase describing the products.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. Good Faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fair use analysis also requires a finding that
defendants used the protected mark in good faith. A �lack of good faith [is
equated] with the subsequent user�s intent to trade on the good will of the
trademark holder by creating confusion as to source or sponsorship.� <i>EMI
Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 66. In analyzing the good faith element, �the focus
of the inquiry is ... whether defendant in adopting its mark intended to
capitalize on plaintiff�s good will.� <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, �[b]ecause the
good faith inquiry in a fair use analysis necessarily concerns the question
whether the user of a mark intended to create consumer confusion as to source
or sponsorship, ... the same contextual considerations [evaluated in a
likelihood of confusion analysis for a trademark infringement claim] apply to a
court�s analysis of good faith in the fair use defense.� <i>Id.</i> at
66&#8211;67. Thus, �a court must take into account the overall context in which
the marks appear and the totality of factors that could cause consumer
confusion� just as it would �[w]hen considering the likelihood of confusion and
assessing the similarity of two marks.� <i>Id.</i> at 66. In addition, the
court, on a motion for summary judgment, must consider all evidence in the
record pointing to the alleged infringer�s <a name="co_pp_sp_4637_427_1"></a>both
good and bad faith. <i>Id.</i> at 76.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Turning to the evidence in the record, Fox argues
that the following facts raise a material issue for trial concerning
plaintiffs� alleged bad faith: first, DBI did not conduct a trademark search
prior to the launch of its beauty products; and second, � DBI � failed to take
necessary action to discontinue the sale of allegedly infringing products after
receiving Fox�s cease and desist letters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With respect to DBI�s failure to conduct a
trademark search, it is well established that �failure to perform an official
trademark search ... does not, standing alone, prove ... bad faith.� <i>Savin
Corp. v. Savin Group,</i> 391 F.3d 439, 460 (2d Cir.2004) (citing <i>Streetwise
Maps, Inc. v. VanDam, Inc.,</i> 159 F.3d 739, 746 (2d Cir.1998)) (internal
citations omitted); <i>see also EMI Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 67; <i>Car&#8211;Freshner,</i>
70 F.3d at 270. Even if plaintiffs had prior knowledge of Fox�s trademark, that
fact would not demonstrate lack of good faith without additional evidence
supporting an inference of bad faith. <i>See, e.g., Savin Corp.,</i> 391 F.3d
at 460; <i>Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley Works,</i> 59 F.3d 384, 397 (2d
Cir.1995); <i>EMI Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 67; <i>Car&#8211;Freshner,</i> 70
F.3d at 270. Thus, as a matter of law, DBI�s failure to conduct a trademark
search prior to using �love potion,� standing alone, does not demonstrate bad
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B152016668829_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox also points to DBI�s alleged failure to
discontinue the sale of products with the words �love potion� after she
provided notice of the alleged trademark infringement. But the �failure to
completely abandon the use after receiving a cease and desist letter is insufficient
to support an allegation of bad faith� as a matter of law. <i>Something Old,</i>
1999 WL 1125063, at *7; <i>see also Wonder Labs, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.,</i> 728 F.Supp. 1058, 1064 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (failure to abort advertising
campaign upon receipt of cease and desist letter �is absolutely no proof that
the defendant acted in bad faith to capitalize on the plaintiff�s trademark�).
Notice of Fox�s trademark rights&#8212;either by her trademark registration or
the cease and desist letters&#8212;�does not preclude use of the words
contained in [Fox�s] registered mark in their primary [, descriptive] sense,� <i>Wonder
Labs,</i> 728 F.Supp. at 1064, especially where DBI believed that its use was
descriptive, <i>see Something Old,</i> 1999 WL 1125063, at *7. Indeed, the
numerous letters exchanged between the parties indicate that DBI had maintained
the position that its use of �love potion� was fair use. (<i>See, e.g.,</i>
4/23/04 Letter (�our client�s use of the term �love potion� is fair use�);
5/24/04 Letter (same)).<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00662016668829_ID0"></a><sup>6</sup>
In its June 4, 2004 letter to Fox, DBI �for business reasons, [agreed] to cease
and desist from the use of the term �love potion,� � but nevertheless
maintained that its �use of �love potion� in phrases like �deliciously kissable
love potion fragrance� [was] merely descr[i]ptive.� (6/4/04 Letter). These
letters show that DBI believed that its use of �love potion� was
descriptive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the record before the Court, no reasonable jury
could find bad faith; to the contrary, a reasonable jury could only conclude
that DBI acted in good faith. An indication of good faith is �the display of
defendant�s own name or trademark in conjunction with the mark it allegedly
infringes.� <i>EMI Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 67, citing <i>Cosmetically
Sealed,</i> 125 F.3d at 30. This is so because the use of a distinct trademark
minimizes any likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of a
product. <i>See W.W.W. Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. v. Gillette Co.,</i> 984 F.2d
567, 573 (2d Cir.1993) (�Where a similar <a name="co_pp_sp_4637_428_1"></a>mark
is used in conjunction with a company name, the likelihood of confusion may be
lessened.�). As discussed above, all DBI products had the DESSERT trademark and
indicia, reflecting DBI�s efforts to differentiate its products in the
marketplace rather than to trade on Fox�s, or any other seller�s, good will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Furthermore, in light of �the overall context in
which the marks appear and the totality of factors that could cause consumer
confusion,� <i>EMI Catalogue,</i> 228 F.3d at 66&#8211;67, the dissimilarities
between the products are patently obvious as to dispel any inference that DBI
was trying to pass its products as one of Fox�s Love Potion Perfumes or to
confuse consumers as to source or sponsorship. The only similarity is the term
�love potion,� which alone is insufficient to establish a likelihood of
confusion. <i>See Clairol, Inc. v. Cosmair, Inc.,</i> 592 F.Supp. 811, 815
(S.D.N.Y.1984) (�the mere fact that two marks may share words in common is not
determinative� in assessing likelihood of confusion).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The differences between the products and their
marks, however, are manifest&#8212;a fact that Fox herself concedes. �Love
potion� is written in different fonts on the parties� products; on the DBI
labels, �deliciously kissable love potion fragrance� is written in sans serif
font, but �Love Potion Perfume� is written in cursive. In addition, �Love
Potion Perfume� is written on a white label strung to the perfume bottle. In
contrast, the DBI product names and trademark are emblazoned directly on the
bottles and packaging. Moreover, Fox�s Love Potion Perfumes are sold in a
diamond-shaped bottle and packaged in a clear plastic bag and organza pouch. On
the other hand, DBI�s love potion fragrance is packaged in a long, cylindrical
tube with a pumping device; its belly button love potion fragrance is sold in a
roll-on container and packaged in a rectangular box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Notwithstanding both parties� usage of the words
�love potion,� a reasonable jury could only find that it was not likely that
consumers would be confused. In short, no reasonable jury could conclude that
plaintiff acted in bad faith to capitalize on Fox�s trademark. Indeed, the
evidence only shows plaintiff�s good faith. Because there is no material issue
warranting trial with respect to the fair use defense, plaintiff�s motion for
summary judgment on the trademark claims is granted and Fox�s cross motion is
denied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The service mark registered with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office is displayed in a distinctive font that
Kelly&#8211;Brown uses on her website and other materials, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:black'><img border=0 width=189 height=45 id="Picture 26"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The service mark states, �THE COLOR(S) LIGHT BLUE
IS/ARE CLAIMED AS A FEATURE OF THE MARK. THE MARK CONSISTS OF LIGHT BLUE SCRIPTED
LETTERS WHICH CREATE THE WORDS OWN YOUR �POWER.�� Kelly&#8211;Brown's service
mark was registered May 27, 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendant Oprah almost needs no introduction, but
warrants one in this context. She runs a vast media empire, which consists of, <i>inter
alia,</i> a magazine, and a website, which is run by Harpo, and (until
recently) a television program. Oprah's name and images figure prominently in
the branding of these enterprises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At roughly the same time that Kelly&#8211;Brown was
seeking to register her service mark in �Own Your Power,� the defendants also
sought to register a trademark in a new Oprah venture, the Oprah Winfrey
Network, to be known as �OWN.� During the creation of OWN, Harpo arranged for
the transfer of a trademark in �OWN ONYX WOMAN NETWORK� from its original owner
to Harpo to avoid an infringement action from that mark's original owner.
Defendants would likely have been aware of Kelly&#8211;Brown's pending
registration for the service mark in �Own Your Power,� since the same search
defendants would have run to locate and negotiate the transfer of the trademark
in �OWN ONYX WOMAN NETWORK� would have also revealed Kelly&#8211;Brown's mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kelly&#8211;Brown alleges that the defendants
infringed upon her service mark by producing a bevy of publications, events,
and online content all using the phrase, �Own Your Power.� For example, the
October 2010 issue of O, the Oprah Magazine (the �Magazine�), which was
distributed on or about September 13, 2010, prominently featured the words �Own
Your Power� on its front cover. Beneath these words were the sub-headings �How
to Tap Into Your Strength�; �Focus Your Energy�; and �Let Your Best Self
Shine.� It also contained the following headline set off to the right side:
�THE 2010 O POWER LIST! 20 Women Who Are Rocking the World.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Power List therein consisted of a list of
people who were influential in various fields, with each serving as an example
of a particular �kind� of power. For example, one page contained a photograph
of the actress Julia Roberts and a paragraph describing her. Set off from the
text is a red circle containing the phrase �THE POWER OF ... living large.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On September 16, 2010, the Magazine, in connection
with various other businesses, including defendants Wells Fargo, Clinique, and
Chico's, held an �Own Your Power� event (the �Event�). At the Event, various
celebrities posed for promotional photographs in front of an �Own Your Power�
backdrop that also contained trademarks for Chico's, Wells Fargo, Clinique, and
the Magazine. The Event involved a seminar and workshop offering motivational
advice regarding self-awareness, self-realization, and entrepreneurship, under
the aegis of the theme �Own Your Power.� The Event was subsequently described
in the December 2010 issue of the Magazine as the �FIRST&#8211;EVER OWN YOUR
POWER EVENT.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Following the Event, the Harpo website (the
�Website�) contained video clips from the Event and placed �Own Your Power�
banners and content on at least 75 different individual webpages. Each page
containing the �Own Your Power� banner displayed the same header image, with
font and graphics that resembled the layout of the October issue of the
Magazine. In the center of the banner were the words �Own Your Power!� in a
large italicized font. On either side of these words were truncated, colored
circles, each containing text. The text inside the leftmost circle contained
the words, �The Power of ...� To the right were arrayed other circles containing
ellipses followed by the words, �... heart,� �... vision,� �... one voice,� and
�... seizing the moment.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The October issue contained pages with a similar
format, with the phrase �the power of ...� surrounded by various concepts
written in colored circles, each beginning with an ellipsis. The �Own Your
Power� bannered pages of the website included articles such as, �How to Tap
Into Your True Power,� �Motivation: One Entrepreneur's Fabulous Story,� and
�The Secrets of Success.� Each page is accompanied by banner advertisements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Approximately two weeks after the Event occurred,
the Magazine's Facebook page displayed photographs taken that evening. On
September 27, 2010, Oprah appeared on her television show and displayed the
cover of the October 2010 issue of the Magazine. In addition, the December 2010
issue of the Magazine, circulated around November 13, 2010, contained information
encouraging readers to view the videos from the Event online at the Website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Following the Magazine's Own Your Power cover,
Kelly&#8211;Brown and Own Your Power Communications, Inc. received numerous
inquiries from people who appear to have confused Kelly&#8211;Brown's services
with Oprah's Event, Website, and Magazine. Competition from Oprah has been
detrimental to Kelly&#8211;Brown's brand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a result, Kelly&#8211;Brown brought this suit in
the District of New Jersey on July 28, 2011, alleging six causes of action
under the Lanham Act: trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, reverse
confusion, false designation of origin, contributory trademark infringement,
and vicarious trademark infringement, as well as seven New Jersey state law
claims. On November 3, 2011, the District of New Jersey granted a motion to
transfer venue of the case to the Southern District of New York.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The defendants moved to dismiss. The District Court
granted their motion in its entirety. <i>Kelly&#8211;Brown v. Winfrey,</i> No.
11 Civ. 7875, 2012 WL 701262 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2012). With regard to the Lanham
Act claims, the District Court held that the defendants' use of the words Own
Your Power constituted fair use. The defense of fair use requires proof that
the use was made �(1) other than as a mark, (2) in a descriptive sense, and (3)
in good faith.� <i>JA Apparel Corp. v. Abboud,</i> 568 F.3d 390, 400 (2d
Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The District Court first reasoned that defendants
engaged in a non-trademark use because there was no chance that an observer of
the Magazine or Event would believe that they were created by Kelly&#8211;Brown
and her company. <i>Kelly&#8211;Brown,</i> 2012 WL 701262, at *3. It noted that
Oprah was pictured on the October 2010 Magazine cover, indicating to the viewer
who it was that had put forward the Magazine. <i>Id.</i> Further, it stated
that the placement of the phrase on the Magazine's cover indicated that it was
simply a headline describing the contents of the Magazine. <i>Id.</i> In
deciding that the Magazine Cover employed a non-trademark use of �Own Your
Power,� the District Court indicated that the satisfaction of the first factor
of the fair use analysis alone would be sufficient to dismiss
Kelly&#8211;Brown's Lanham Act claims, but it went on to discuss the other two
elements of the analysis because these, too, it believed, supported its
determination that the defendants had engaged in fair use of the phrase �Own
Your Power.� <i>Id.</i> at * 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, the District Court determined that the use of
the words �Own Your Power� was descriptive because it described an action that
it hoped that Magazine readers would take after reading the Magazine. <i>Id.</i>
at *4&#8211;5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, the District Court held that the defendants
did not exhibit bad faith in using the mark. It decided that Kelly&#8211;Brown
had pleaded no facts that plausibly suggested that the defendants intended to
capitalize on her good will. <i>Id.</i> at *6. It reasoned further that there
was no likelihood of consumer confusion because the font, color, and formatting
of the defendants' use was significantly different from that protected by
Kelly&#8211;Brown's registered service mark. <i>Id.</i> The District Court
therefore held that all three of the elements of the fair use defense were met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Having found that the defendants' use constituted
fair use, the District Court went on to dismiss Kelly&#8211;Brown's trademark
infringement, reverse confusion, and false designation of origin claims on that
basis. <i>Id.</i> at *6&#8211;7. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because it found that Kelly&#8211;Brown's complaint
must be dismissed for all the above reasons, it declined to reach the
defendants' First Amendment arguments. <i>Id.</i> at *9�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span

<p class=Centered>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On an appeal from a grant of a motion to dismiss,
we review de novo the decision of the district court. <i>Capital Mgmt. Select
Fund Ltd. v. Bennett,</i> 680 F.3d 214, 219 (2d Cir.2012). We accept all
factual allegations in the complaint as true, drawing all reasonable inferences
in favor of the plaintiff. <i>Tiberio v. Allergy Asthma Immunology of
Rochester,</i> 664 F.3d 35, 36 (2d Cir.2011). �To survive a motion to dismiss,
a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state
a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.� <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> 556
U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kelly&#8211;Brown brings suit pursuant to �� 32 and
43 of the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. �� 1114, 1125. Section 32(1)(a) of the Lanham
Act prohibits any person from �us[ing] in commerce any reproduction,
counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection
with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or
services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,
or to cause mistake, or to deceive.� 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a). Section 43(a)
similarly prohibits any person from �us[ing] in commerce,� in connection with
any goods or services, �any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any
combination thereof ... which ... is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or
her goods [or] services ... by another person....� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With one exception we discuss below, defendants
here do not argue that Kelly&#8211;Brown has failed to adequately allege the
elements of an infringement claim. Rather, the defendants argue, as the
District Court decided, that their actions are protected by the doctrine of
fair use. Before we discuss the substance of that defense, it is helpful as
background to observe that the Lanham Act protects marks from two kinds of
confusion. It protects against direct confusion, where there is a likelihood
that consumers will �believe that the trademark owner sponsors or endorses the
use of the challenged mark.� <i>EMI Catalogue P'ship v. Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulos Inc.,</i> 228 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir.2000). It also protects
against so-called �reverse confusion,� where the consumer will believe �that
the junior user is the source of the senior user's goods.� <i>Banff, Ltd. v.
Federated Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> 841 F.2d 486, 490 (2d Cir.1988). In reverse
confusion cases, consumers may believe that the senior user is �an unauthorized
infringer, and the [junior user's] use of the mark may in that way injure [the
senior user's] reputation and impair its good will.� <i>Id.</i>
Kelly&#8211;Brown here alleges that defendants' repeated use of the phrase �Own
Your Power� causes reverse confusion within the market for motivational
services and publications, and therefore infringes her service mark in that
same phrase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In order to make a successful fair use defense to a
trademark infringement claim, the defendant must prove three elements: that the
use was made (1) other than as a mark, (2) in a descriptive sense, and (3) in
good faith. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1115(b)(4); <i>EMI Catalogue P'ship,</i> 228
F.3d at 64. The defendants offer only this narrow challenge to the adequacy of
Kelly&#8211;Brown's pleading of infringement: that the first element of a fair
use defense, use as a trademark, is a threshold requirement for adequately
alleging a claim of infringement. That is to say, if Kelly&#8211;Brown has not
satisfied the �as a mark� requirement, her infringement claims fail as a matter
of law. We consider this argument and then discuss defendant's fair use
defense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I. Trademark Use as a Threshold Requirement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In its analysis the District Court stated that
unless Kelly&#8211;Brown showed that the defendants used the phrase �Own Your
Power� as a trademark, her claim must fail as a matter of law. <i>Kelly&#8211;Brown,</i>
2012 WL 701262, at *4. The defendants advance the same argument on appeal.
Defendants claim that our prior decisions and law from the Sixth Circuit
support the conclusion that use as a mark is a threshold requirement. We
conclude that defendants misinterpret our prior law, and we conclude that the
Sixth Circuit's analysis does not comport with our law on consumer confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In interpreting our prior decisions, defendants
conflate two distinct concepts, use <i>of</i> a trademark in commerce and use <i>as</i>
a mark, both of which, confusingly, we describe by the shorthand phrase
�trademark use.� Plaintiffs are required to show �use in commerce� as an
element of an infringement claim. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. �� 1114(1)(a),
1125(a)(1). The Lanham Act defines �use in commerce� as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The term �use in commerce� means the bona fide use of a
mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in
a mark. For purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in
commerce&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) on goods when&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(A) it is placed <i>in any manner</i>
on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the
tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such
placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their
sale, and</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(B) the goods are sold or
transported in commerce, and</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or
advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce, or the
services are rendered in more than one State or in the United States and a
foreign country and the person rendering the services is engaged in commerce in
connection with the services.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1127 (emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A plaintiff is not required to demonstrate that a
defendant made use of the mark in any particular way to satisfy the �use in
commerce� requirement. The element is satisfied if the mark is affixed to the
goods �in any manner.� 15 U.S.C. � 1127; <i>see also Rescuecom Corp. v. Google,
Inc.,</i> 562 F.3d 123, 125&#8211;26, 129 (2d Cir.2009) (holding that Google's
use of the plaintiff's trademark as a keyword to trigger the display of the
advertiser's copy on Google's search results page and as a suggestion to
advertisers as a keyword they might purchase were sufficient to satisfy the
�use in commerce� requirement).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants do not argue that Kelly&#8211;Brown has
not satisfied the �use in commerce� requirement. Such an argument would be unavailing
in any event. The defendants have certainly used the words �Own Your Power� in
commerce. The words �Own Your Power� appeared prominently on the front cover of
the Magazine&#8212;a good for sale&#8212;and on the Oprah Website, which
contained banner advertisements alongside �Own Your Power� content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The analysis we conduct when considering whether a
defendant has used a mark in commerce contrasts sharply with the inquiry we
conduct when, as here, we are considering whether the defendant used a
competitor's mark �as a mark.� In determining whether a particular use is made
�as a mark,� we ask whether the defendant is using the �term as a symbol to
attract public attention.� <i>JA Apparel Corp.,</i> 568 F.3d at 400.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>JA Apparel,</i> the defendant sold an
eponymous clothing line; he subsequently began a new clothing line and ran
print ads for the line that included his trademarked name. <i>Id.</i> at 392.
We suggested, without deciding, that our conclusion as to whether defendant was
using his own name as a mark would differ depending on the content of the ad he
ran. <i>Id.</i> at 402. We suggested that an ad which contained, in small text,
the words �Designer Joseph Abboud in a 2 Button Super 120 S Charcoal
Chalkstripe from His Fall 2008 Jaz Collection,� would be a use of defendant's
name that was not a mark. <i>Id.</i> By contrast, we suggested that an ad which
contained the words, �A New Composition by JOSEPH ABBOUD,� in larger text than
the name of the new brand, would be use as a mark. <i>Id.</i> When determining
whether a defendant has used something �as a mark,� we must conduct a close
examination of the content and context of the use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, in determining whether the plaintiffs have
satisfied the �use in commerce� requirement, we ask whether the trademark has
been displayed to consumers in connection with a commercial transaction. In
determining whether a use is made �as a mark,� however, we make a more detailed
determination of the particular manner in which the mark was used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In arguing that �trademark use� is a threshold
requirement, defendants rely upon <i>1&#8211;800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com,
Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 400, 411&#8211;12 (2d Cir.2005). They cite <i>1&#8211;800
Contacts</i> for the proposition that � �use� must be decided as a threshold
matter.� <i>Id.</i> at 412. An examination of the surrounding text makes clear
that <i>1&#8211;800 Contacts</i> refers not to use <i>as</i> mark, but rather
use <i>of</i> a mark in commerce. This passage reads,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Not only are �use,� �in commerce,� and �likelihood of
confusion� three distinct elements of a trademark infringement claim, but �use�
must be decided as a threshold matter because, while any number of activities
may be �in commerce� or create a likelihood of confusion, no such activity is
actionable under the Lanham Act absent the �use� <i>of</i> a trademark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). While we held in <i>1&#8211;800
Contacts</i> that demonstrating use in commerce is a threshold burden on
plaintiff, we have never so held with regard to use �as a mark.� Defendants are
therefore incorrect that our case law requires plaintiffs to demonstrate they
have used Own Your Power �as a mark� in order to adequately allege a cause of
action for trademark infringement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants also rely upon Sixth Circuit law for the
proposition that use <i>as</i> a mark is a threshold requirement for a Lanham
Act claim. The Sixth Circuit, unlike this Circuit, has held that use <i>as</i>
a mark is a threshold requirement. <i>See Hensley Mfg., Inc. v. ProPride, Inc.,</i>
579 F.3d 603, 610 (6th Cir.2009); <i>Interactive Prods. Corp. v. a2z Mobile
Office Solutions, Inc.,</i> 326 F.3d 687, 694&#8211;95 (6th Cir.2003). The
Sixth Circuit has extrapolated this requirement not from the �use[ ] in
commerce� element of the statute, 15 U.S.C. �� 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1), but
rather from the consumer confusion element, reasoning that in instances where
the defendant does not use the mark as a designation of origin, consumers are
unlikely to be misled as to the source of the goods. <i>Hensley Mfg.,</i> 579
F.3d at 610; <i>Interactive Prods.,</i> 326 F.3d at 695.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Sixth Circuit's approach does not cohere with
our jurisprudence on consumer confusion. In determining whether there is a
likelihood of consumer confusion, we apply the eight-factor balancing test set
forth in <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs. Corp.,</i> 287 F.2d 492 (2d
Cir.1961). �The eight factors are: (1) strength of the trademark; (2)
similarity of the marks; (3) proximity of the products and their
competitiveness with one another; (4) evidence that the senior user may �bridge
the gap� by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged
infringer's product; (5) evidence of actual consumer confusion; (6) evidence
that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith; (7) respective quality of the
products; and (8) sophistication of consumers in the relevant market.� <i>Starbucks
Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc.,</i> 588 F.3d 97, 115 (2d Cir.2009). �The
application of the <i>Polaroid</i> test is �not mechanical, but rather, focuses
on the ultimate question of whether, looking at the products in their totality,
consumers are likely to be confused.� � <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Star Indus.,
Inc. v. Bacardi &amp; Co., Ltd.,</i> 412 F.3d 373, 384 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Sixth Circuit has made a judgment that no
consumer will be confused unless the defendant is using the infringing content
as a mark. But the <i>Polaroid</i> test, which we have long used, is a
fact-intensive inquiry that depends greatly on the particulars of each case. To
elevate one particular consideration, which is not even one of the eight <i>Polaroid</i>
factors, above all of the other factors would be inconsistent with this
Circuit's approach to Lanham Act cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, although we have never decided this
precise issue, we have previously allowed certain claims to proceed even where
the defendant is not using the plaintiff's mark as a mark. <i>See, e.g., EMI
Catalogue P'ship,</i> 228 F.3d at 64, 67&#8211;68 (holding that material issues
of fact existed as to whether use of the slogan �Swing Swing Swing,� playing
off of the trademarked song title �Sing Sing Sing (with a Swing),� was fair
use, notwithstanding our holding that the slogan was not used as a mark); <i>Louis
Vuitton Malletier v. Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp.,</i> 426 F.3d 532,
539 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that defendant's handbag meant to evoke Louis
Vuitton's trademarked handbags could create consumer confusion even in the
absence of an allegation that the defendant was attempting to establish its
design as a competing mark). The Sixth Circuit's test would lead to the
dismissal of these claims without addressing what is beyond doubt the central
question in considering consumer confusion: whether consumers were actually
confused by the allegedly infringing product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We therefore decline to adopt the rule that Lanham
Act plaintiffs must show that the defendant was using the allegedly infringing
content �as a mark� as a threshold issue in order to establish consumer
confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II. Fair Use</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In order to assert a successful fair use defense to
a trademark infringement claim, the defendant must prove three elements: that
the use was made (1) other than as a mark, (2) in a descriptive sense, and (3)
in good faith. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1115(b)(4); <i>EMI Catalogue P'ship,</i>
228 F.3d at 64. Because fair use is an affirmative defense, it often requires
consideration of facts outside of the complaint and thus is inappropriate to
resolve on a motion to dismiss. Affirmative defenses may be adjudicated at this
stage in the litigation, however, where the facts necessary to establish the
defense are evident on the face of the complaint. <i>McKenna v. Wright,</i> 386
F.3d 432, 436 (2d Cir.2004). Plaintiffs, in rebutting defendants' arguments,
are held only to the usual burden of a motion to dismiss, <i>id.,</i> which is
to say they must plead sufficient facts to plausibly suggest that they are
entitled to relief, <i>Iqbal,</i> 556 U.S. at 678.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants here note that the mere fact that
someone owns a mark that contains a particular word or phrase does not grant
the holder the exclusive right to use that word or phrase commercially. <i>See
Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co.,</i> 978 F.2d 947, 951 (7th
Cir.1992) (�The fair use doctrine is based on the principle that no one should
be able to appropriate descriptive language through trademark registration.�).
�[T]he owner's rights in a mark extend only to its significance as an
identifying source, not to the original descriptive meanings of a mark,� <i>EMI
Catalogue P'ship,</i> 228 F.3d at 64, and so where another person uses the
words constituting that mark in a purely descriptive sense, this use may
qualify as permissible fair use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We now consider whether the defendants have
satisfied each element of a fair use defense in turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>A. Trademark Use</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted above, in determining whether the
defendants were using the words �Own Your Power� as a mark, we ask whether they
were using the term �as a symbol to attract public attention.� <i>JA Apparel,</i>
568 F.3d at 400 (internal quotation marks omitted). Kelly&#8211;Brown alleges
that the defendants used the phrase �Own Your Power� in several unique
instances and that these collectively constitute use as a mark. She provides
allegations regarding several such uses, including: (1) the October Issue of
the Magazine, featuring the phrase in the center of the Issue's cover; (2) the
Own Your Power Event, billed as the �first ever,� that featured motivational
content; (3) promotion of the Event through social media; and (4) the online
video from the Event and other motivational articles provided on an �Own Your
Power� section of Oprah's website. Kelly&#8211;Brown argues that, taken
together, these uses suggest that the defendants were attempting to build an
association with consumers between the phrase �Own Your Power� and Oprah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At this stage in the litigation, this array of uses
is sufficient for us to infer a pattern of use. We thus conclude that
Kelly&#8211;Brown has plausibly alleged that Oprah was attempting to build a new
segment of her media empire around the theme or catchphrase �Own Your Power,�
beginning with the October Issue and expanding outward from there. We have
recognized that established companies are allowed to seek trademarks in
sub-brands. <i>See Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537
F.2d 4, 14 (2d Cir.1976). Kelly&#8211;Brown's complaint implies that Oprah is a
brand and is therefore the ultimate source of all things related to that brand,
but that defendants sought to use the phrase �Own Your Power� to denote a
particular line of services and content within the larger Oprah brand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants counter that this case is on all fours
with <i>Packman v. Chicago Tribune Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 628, 633 (7th Cir.2001).
There, the Chicago Tribune published a newspaper with the headline �The Joy of
Six� after the Chicago Bulls won their sixth basketball championship. <i>Id.</i>
at 634. Plaintiff claimed she had a trademark in the phrase. <i>Id.</i> The
Tribune later reproduced this front page on various promotional items. <i>Id.</i>
The Seventh Circuit concluded that this use was merely a headline, rather than
a use as a mark, because the Tribune's masthead clearly identified the source
of the newspaper, and because the sports memorabilia at issue in the case was
more readily identifiable with the Tribune brand name than with the phrase �Joy
of Six.� <i>Id.</i> at 639&#8211;40. Defendants rely on <i>Packman</i> to argue
that their use of the phrase �Own Your Power� was similarly only a headline and
that the subsequent use in connection with the Event and on the Website were
derivative of this use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants' use of the phrase �Own Your Power� was
much different than the Chicago Tribune's use of the phrase �The Joy of Six.�
Defendants' use was far more wide-ranging and varied. At least with respect to
the Website, the content was not merely derivative of the October Issue in the
sense that the promotional items in <i>Packman</i> were derivative of the original
headline. In <i>Packman,</i> the promotional hats and T-shirts plaintiff
alleged infringed her trademark merely reproduced the front page of a
particular issue of the Chicago Tribune. By contrast, the articles on the
Website here contained unique content that was not previously published in the
October Issue of the Magazine. The webpages attached to the complaint do not
even directly reference the October Issue, its cover page, or its content. A
viewer of these pages could easily read their copy without realizing that an
issue of the Magazine had ever so much as used the phrase �Own Your Power.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Complaint provides few allegations regarding
what happened at the Event. It was, however, referred to as the �first-ever� of
its kind, suggesting that it was not directly tied to a particular issue of the
Magazine, but instead was to be a recurring enterprise within the Oprah media
empire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Courts are more likely to treat recurring themes or
devices as entitled to protection as a mark, even where a single iteration
might not enjoy such protection. The titles of literary series enjoy more
protection as marks than single works of artistic expression. <i>Compare EMI
Catalogue P'ship,</i> 228 F.3d at 63 (holding that a single work of artistic
expression is entitled to protection if the title has acquired secondary
meaning) <i>with</i> 2 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR
COMPETITION � 10:7 (4th ed. 2012) (�[S]econdary meaning need not be proven for
an inherently distinctive title of a literary series, newspaper, periodical,
television series or the like.�). Similarly, courts have protected advertising
slogans under the theory that companies have devoted a great deal of time and
expense into creating an association in the minds of consumers between a slogan
and a particular product. <i>See, e.g., Nike, Inc. v. �Just Did It� Enters.,</i>
6 F.3d 1225, 1227&#8211;28 (7th Cir.1993); <i>Cont'l Scale Corp. v. Weight
Watchers Int'l, Inc.,</i> 517 F.2d 1378, 1379&#8211;80 (C.C.P.A.1975); <i>Chem.
Corp. of Am. v. Anheuser&#8211;Busch, Inc.,</i> 306 F.2d 433, 436 (5th
Cir.1962).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Repetition is important because it forges an
association in the minds of consumers between a marketing device and a product.
When consumers hear a successful slogan, for example, they immediately think of
a particular product without even being prompted by the product's actual name.
When they encounter the title of a popular literary series, they will
recognize, just based on the name, that the work is one of that series and is
therefore the work of a particular author. The slogan or title becomes a
symbolic identifier of a product or product line through repetition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is adequately alleged in the complaint that the
defendants were trying to create, through repetition across various forms of
media, a similar association between Oprah and the phrase �Own Your Power.� The
defendants began to create the association between that phrase and Oprah with
the cover of the October Issue of the Magazine, and continued to encourage it
through both the Event and the Website. Each of these employed usages of the
phrase �Own Your Power� involved separate content and context, and thus it is
plausible that the defendants were attempting to build up a line of
wide-ranging content all denoted by the phrase �Own Your Power.� �Own Your
Power,� through these interrelated uses, would thus become symbolic shorthand
for the products and message as a whole, meant to remind consumers of a
particular kind of Oprah-related content. Thus, plaintiffs have alleged that
this repeated and wide-ranging usage of the phrase �Own Your Power� functioned
as a mark. Of course, further information may emerge during discovery that
undermines Kelly&#8211;Brown's theory that Oprah's use was an attempt to create
a sub-brand, but her allegations are sufficient at this stage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fact that Oprah's (household) name was also
attached to the Magazine, the Website, and the Event does not suffice to
demonstrate that �Own Your Power� was not also employed as a mark in each of
its uses by defendants. It is well established law that both a slogan and a
single brand name can serve as co-existent marks. <i>See Grotrian, Helfferich,
Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway &amp; Sons,</i> 523 F.2d 1331,
1338&#8211;39 (2d Cir.1975) (holding that �Steinway The Instrument of
Immortals� was a properly �registered slogan� notwithstanding the fact that
Steinway itself was also a protected mark); <i>see also Sands, Taylor &amp;
Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co.,</i> 978 F.2d 947, 954 (7th Cir.1992) (�Nor is a
defendant's use of a term in conjunction with its own trademark <i>per se</i> a
use other than as a trademark.� (internal quotation marks omitted)); 1 MCCARTHY
ON TRADEMARKS � 7.21 (�The fact that a slogan is used in conjunction with a
previously existing trademark does not mean that the slogan does not also function
as a mark, for a product can bear more than one trademark.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To be sure, we have previously noted that �the
prominent display of the defendants' own trademarks� can contribute to a
finding that the defendants were not using a different distinct phrase as a
mark. <i>See Cosmetically Sealed Indus., Inc. v. Chesebrough&#8211;Pond's USA
Co.,</i> 125 F.3d 28, 30&#8211;31 (2d Cir.1997). In <i>Cosmetically Sealed,</i>
a lipstick manufacturer had a display of trial-sized lipsticks as well as
complimentary postcards that customers were encouraged to use to test the
lipsticks. <i>Id.</i> at 29. The display featured the words, �Seal it with a
Kiss!!� which another lipstick manufacturer, the plaintiff, used as a slogan,
and in which the plaintiff held a valid trademark. <i>Id.</i> We there held
that such use was not done �as a mark.� But <i>Cosmetically Sealed</i> did not
announce a rule that all use was other than �as a mark� if the defendant also
displayed a different mark, such as Oprah's name in this case, in close
proximity. Rather, this fact was one of several considerations in a
fact-intensive analysis. Also crucial to our finding there was the fact that
�[t]he challenged phrase [did] not appear on the lipstick itself, on its
packaging, or in any other advertising or promotional materials related to [the
defendant's] product.� <i>Id.</i> at 31. The words �Seal it with a Kiss!!� thus
did not help to identify the product in any context but a single advertising
campaign. The defendants' use of the phrase �Own Your Power� here was not
similarly tangential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>54</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kelly&#8211;Brown therefore has plausibly alleged
that the defendants intended to create a new line of products and services
offered by Oprah under the mark �Own Your Power.� Defendants thus have not met
their burden at this stage in the litigation in demonstrating that their use of
the phrase �Own Your Power� in its various iterations was use other than as a
mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>B. Descriptive Sense</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The next element of a fair use defense is that the
disputed use was in a descriptive sense. Defendants argue that the use of the
phrase �Own Your Power� was descriptive of the publications to which that
phrase was attached. They argue that the use of the phrase on the Magazine's
cover describes its contents and also �served as an exhortation for readers to
take action to own their power and described a desired benefit of reading the
Magazine Issue.� They further assert that subsequent uses of the phrase in
connection with the Event, on the Website, etc., were merely referring back to
this original, approved use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the outset, it should be noted that the phrase
�Own Your Power� differs from the sort of phrase which courts usually find to
be used descriptively. Courts more readily find a phrase descriptive when it is
in common usage. For example, we have found the instruction �Seal it with a
Kiss!!� to be descriptive where lipstick testers were to kiss a postcard
wearing the lipstick and then send it to a loved one. <i>Cosmetically Sealed
Indus.,</i> 125 F.3d at 30. In so holding, we noted, �The phrase �sealed with a
kiss' is a fixture of the language, used by generations of school girls, who
have given it such currency that it is readily recognized when communicated
only as an acronym&#8212;SWAK.� <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the Seventh Circuit held
that the phrase �The Joy of Six� was descriptive after noting that the phrase
�is a play on the 1970s book series <i>The Joy of Sex</i> � and �has been used
to describe positive feelings associated with six of anything.� <i>Packman,</i>
267 F.3d at 641. By contrast, we have held that the slogan �Swing Swing Swing�
for golf clubs, playing on the title of the Benny Goodman song �Sing Sing
Sing,� was not descriptive because golfers �swing� their clubs, not �swing
swing swing� them. <i>EMI Catalogue P'ship,</i> 228 F.3d at 65.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>57</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants have not argued that the phrase �Own
Your Power� was in popular usage. Nor indeed could they in a motion to dismiss.
Doing so would surely require defendants to reference material beyond the four
corners of the complaint. Of course, discovery may reveal that the phrase has
some wider currency than is immediately apparent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>58</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To be sure, there is no requirement that a usage be
immediately recognizable as a popular phrase for it to be descriptive. <i>See
Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co.,</i> 978 F.2d at 952&#8211;53. In <i>Sands,</i>
the court held that a material issue of fact existed regarding whether the
tagline �Gatorade is Thirst Aid� was descriptive notwithstanding the fact that
it was not a �common phrase.� <i>Id.</i> at 953. It so held because �the
average consumer [could] perceive[ ] �Thirst Aid� as describing a
characteristic of Gatorade&#8212;its ability to quench thirst.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>59</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But here the phrase �Own Your Power� does not
describe the contents of the Magazine. The words are prominently displayed in
the center of the Magazine with the subtitles �How to Tap Into Your Strength�;
�Focus Your Energy�; and �Let Your Best Self Shine� in smaller type below.
Along the edges of the magazine are specific headlines for articles, including
�THE 2010 O POWER LIST! 20 Women Who Are Rocking the World.� Although both the
center phrase and the article headline make use of the word �power,� it does
not appear that the phrase �Own Your Power� is meant to describe the contents
of a particular item in the Magazine. For example, the �Power List� inside the
Magazine contains a list of admirable people, accompanied by biographical
information about each. But the list does not provide specific advice regarding
how a reader can follow in the footsteps of any of these individuals, nor does
it provide advice regarding how a reader can become more powerful in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>60</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Table of Contents of the Magazine further
underscores the fact that the phrase is not used as a headline for a particular
article or content. The bottom left corner of the page contains a smaller
picture of the cover and a list describing where the articles referenced on the
cover can be found. It does not list any article corresponding to the phrase
�Own Your Power.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>61</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is the defendants' burden here to show that
their use of the phrase �Own Your Power� was descriptive. At this stage in the
litigation, defendants have not made that showing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>C. Good Faith</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>62</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The final element of a fair use defense is a
showing that the use was made in good faith. We �equate a lack of good faith with
the subsequent user's intent to trade on the good will of the trademark holder
by creating confusion as to source or sponsorship.� <i>EMI Catalogue P'ship,</i>
228 F.3d at 66. Even where there is no direct evidence of intent, �if there is
additional evidence that supports the inference that the defendant sought to
confuse consumers as to the source of the product, ... the inference of bad
faith may fairly be drawn.� <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>63</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants, who bear the burden in establishing a
fair use defense, assert that their good faith is evident from the face of the
complaint. They argue, in essence, that it is implausible that someone as
well-known as Oprah would attempt to trade on the goodwill of someone
relatively obscure like Kelly&#8211;Brown. <i>See Star Indus.,</i> 412 F.3d at
389 (finding good faith based in part on �the implausibility of the notion that
a premier international rum manufacturer would seek to conflate its products
with those of a regional discount vodka manufacturer�). The defendants further
observe that the phrase �Own Your Power� was comingled with other Oprah-related
marks, suggesting both that no consumer would be confused as to the origin of
their �Own Your Power� publications and that they were not trading on
Kelly&#8211;Brown's good will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>64</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The defendants are correct that we have found good
faith where a defendant prominently displayed its own marks in a way that overshadows
the plaintiff's mark, reasoning that the prominent placement demonstrates that
the defendant had no intent to trade on the plaintiff's good will. <i>Cosmetically
Sealed Indus.,</i> 125 F.3d at 30&#8211;31. But a plaintiff may also show
absence of good faith where a junior user had knowledge or constructive
knowledge of the senior user's mark and chose to adopt a similar mark. <i>Star
Indus.,</i> 412 F.3d at 389.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>65</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kelly&#8211;Brown argues that she has pleaded facts
sufficient to plausibly suggest that the defendants had knowledge of her mark
and chose to go forward with the �Own Your Power� campaign anyway. Indeed, she
alleges that prior to the rollout of Oprah's new Oprah Winfrey Network, to be
known as �OWN,� the defendants bought the rights to use the acronym �OWN� from
a woman who had previously registered it as an acronym for the �Onyx Woman
Network.� Kelly&#8211;Brown argues that this transaction plausibly suggests
that the defendants conducted a trademark registration search for the word
�Own,� and that such a search would have turned up her then-pending service
mark in the phrase �Own Your Power.� We agree that these allegations do
plausibly suggest that the defendants had knowledge of Kelly&#8211;Brown's
mark, liked it, and decided to use it as their own. In other words, defendants'
allegations that they did not intend to trade on Kelly&#8211;Brown's good will,
even if true, do not preclude a finding of bad faith. <i>See Cadbury Beverages,
Inc. v. Cott Corp.,</i> 73 F.3d 474, 483 (2d Cir.1996) (declining to decide
good faith as a matter of law where defendant used a mark, which happened to be
the name of defendant's parent company, knowing it was identical to plaintiff's
registered mark); <i>see also Kiki Undies Corp. v. Promenade Hosiery Mills,
Inc.,</i> 411 F.2d 1097, 1101 (2d Cir.1969) (explaining that defendant has the
burden of persuasion in such circumstances).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>66</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At bottom, the defendants ask us to weigh their
averments that they did not use the phrase �Own Your Power� in order to trade
on Kelly&#8211;Brown's good will against Kelly&#8211;Brown's allegations that
they were aware of her registered mark before launching the �Own Your Power�
campaign. Our role in considering a motion to dismiss is not to resolve these
sorts of factual disputes. Accordingly, the District Court erred in holding
that the defendants have conclusively demonstrated good faith in their use of
the phrase �Own Your Power.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>D. First Amendment Defense</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>67</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants argue that the judgment of the District
Court should be affirmed on the ground that the First Amendment bars
Kelly&#8211;Brown's claims. We decline to consider this argument in the first
instance.</p>

write separately, however, in the (I hope groundless) fear that the Court's

a publisher in any medium to use a trademarked term, in good faith, to indicate
the contents of its own communication&#8212;whether by magazine cover,
newspaper headline, �blog� heading, or otherwise. Allowing a person or entity's
property right arbitrarily to trump the ability of the initiator of a
communication effectively to transmit news, information, thoughts, and the
like, using vernacular words and phrases that are recognizable because they are
also used as trademarks, would be, in my view, legally unwarranted and 99 and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Lanham Act, under which the plaintiffs' primary
cause of action was brought, was never intended �to deprive commercial speakers
of the ordinary utility of descriptive words.� <i>KP Permanent Make&#8211;Up,
Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.,</i> 543 U.S. 111, 122 (2004). Thus, the
trademark �fair use� defense is animated at least in part by the principle that
�[w]hen the plaintiff chooses a mark with descriptive qualities, ... �[s]he
cannot altogether exclude some kinds of competing uses,� particularly those
which use words in their primary descriptive and non-trademark sense.� <i>U.S.
Shoe Corp. v. Brown Group, Inc.,</i> 740 F.Supp. 196, 198 (S.D.N.Y.) (Leval,
J.) (quoting <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537

�The defendant has as good a right to a descriptive title as has the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The stock in trade of those engaged in publishing,
in the broadest sense of that term, includes turns of phrase and imagery; words
are their raw materials. It would cripple publishers' effectiveness if
trademark holders could obtain exclusive rights to parts of the language for
use as language. A perusal of the day's headlines and magazine covers is, I think,
likely to turn up the use of bona fide trademarks, bearing real secondary
meaning to consumers, as a means of communication, but without trenching on the

Pierre N. Leval, <i>Trademark: Champion of Free Speech,</i> 27 COLUM. J.L.

<p class=Centered><span style='font-style:normal'>II. The Meaning of �Own �</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kelly&#8211;Brown claims to own the mark �Own Your
Power,� as used in connection with the motivational services she offers. Just
as the majority begins its analysis by determining in what sense the phrase �as
a mark� is and has been used, <i>ante</i> at 305&#8211;08, I think it useful to
address at the outset the different senses in which the word �own� is used in
this litigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When we talk about �owning� a trademark, we
obviously use the traditional legal meaning of the word in the sense of �rightfully
hav[ing] or possess[ing] as property.� BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1214 (9th ed.
2009). Taken literally and using the term �own� in this traditional<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[8]</span></span></span></a> sense, however, the
invocation to �Own Your Power� borders on the absurd. If the �Power� is mine, do
I not by definition already �Own� it? What am I being told to do? Or what are
the parties telling me that they can do&#8212;doubtless at some price&#8212;to
help me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judging by the context in which it has been used by
both the plaintiffs and the defendants, it is clear that the meaning of the
word �own� here is closer to �embrace and employ�<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[9]</span></span></span></a> than it is to possess or have
legal ownership. This is hardly a novel way to use the term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> By way of an easily accessible example, in the
final scene of the popular motion picture THE BIRDCAGE (United Artists 1996), a
character played by Robin Williams is escorting an uptight, politically and
socially conservative character played by Gene Hackman through a �drag club.�
Their purpose is to allow Hackman's character to escape media recognition �by
dressing [him and his family] in drag and having them leave the club as the
night's show ends.� <i>The Birdcage,</i> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_
Birdcage (last visited May 28, 2013).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But Hackman's character, uptight as he is, finds it
all-but-impossible to give a convincing portrayal of a man acting and dressed
as a woman. Williams's character turns to him and shouts encouragingly, �Work
it. Sell it. <i>Own it.</i>�<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[10]</span></span></span></a>
I think it is almost certainly in this BIRDCAGE sense&#8212;to embrace and
employ&#8212;or one very like it that the parties here used the word �own� in
their businesses and publications, if not in discussing who �owns� the
trademark at issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Using �own� in that sense, the phrase �Own Your
Power� has more currency than the plaintiffs let on in their complaint&#8212;although
the extent to which this precise use antedates either the defendants' use or
the filing of the complaint is unclear. Writers have employed the word �own� in
similarly figurative, if not necessarily identical, senses for many years.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[11]</span></span></span></a> And by now the phrase �Own
Your Power� itself, using �own� in this way, has apparently gained an
established meaning in the language.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><span style='font-style:normal'>III. Fair Use as to Use of
�Own Your Power!� on the Magazine</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Understanding the meaning of �Own Your Power� thus,
I think that the defendants' use of it on the cover of the Magazine, without
more, is plainly and legally �fair� and therefore lawful. I have little doubt,
more generally, that the use of a trademarked phrase on the cover of a magazine
to refer in a general way to its contents is, standing by itself and in most
cases, entirely legitimate&#8212;a straightforward and significant case of fair
use. I differ from the majority insofar as its analysis implies otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But I understand the majority and I are both
reading the plaintiffs' complaint not to attack this single use standing alone.
<i>See ante</i> at 308 (�Kelly&#8211;Brown argues that, <i>taken together,</i>
these uses suggest that the defendants were attempting to build an association
with consumers between the phrase � Own Your Power� and Oprah.� (emphasis
added)). It is the defendants' use seen as part of a campaign of recurring
uses, across different media, designed to appropriate the defendants'
source-identifier, or without regard for a high likelihood of that occurring,
that defeats their fair use defense. This is not to say that even the use of
�Own Your Power� for the Magazine, website, and seminar event (the �Event�)
together may not also constitute fair use. Only that any such conclusion is
foreclosed at this stage of the proceedings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the majority explains, <i>ante</i> at 308, the
use of the phrase �Own Your Power� on the Magazine is a fair use, and therefore
not actionable under the Lanham Act, if and only if the phrase was used �(1)
other than as a mark, (2) in a descriptive sense, and (3) in good faith.� <i>JA
Apparel Corp. v. Abboud,</i> 568 F.3d 390, 400 (2d Cir.2009) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Because the application of the third element seems to
me to be dispositive, I address them in reverse order, <i>i.e.,</i> use (1) in
good faith, (2) in a descriptive sense, and (3) other than as a mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>1. Good Faith.</i> Were the issue limited to the
use of �Own Your Power!� on the Magazine's cover, I would conclude that there
are no facts plausibly pled that support the conclusion that the defendants
�inten[ded] to trade on the good will of the [plaintiffs] by creating confusion
as to source or sponsorship.� <i>EMI Catalogue P'ship v. Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulos Inc.,</i> 228 F.3d 56, 66 (2d Cir.2000). But the plaintiffs
allege that the Magazine's use of the phrase �Own Your Power� �was only the
beginning of a pattern of deliberate and systematic unauthorized use by
Defendants and a malicious intent to identify the [Defendants] as the source
for the [Plaintiffs'] Services.� Compl. � 41. Further:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[u]pon information and belief, Defendants knowingly
concealed, suppressed, and/or omitted the material fact that they are not the
owners of the [ Own Your Power] Trademark and the source for motivational
communications services in the areas of self-awareness, self-realization, and entrepreneurship
under the [Plaintiffs'] Trademark with intent that the public rely on the
concealment, suppression, and/or omission in connection, distribution and
advertisement of their Counterfeit Campaign.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Compl. � 43. And later:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Upon information and belief, the [Defendants'] multi-tiered
campaign, utilizing the extensive reach of television, the internet, and print
media, has already reached millions of consumers. Defendants' media presence
has been documented to persuade, influence and command the opinion of its
audience. The OYP Partnership's sheer saturation of the market by Defendants'
concerted efforts, Counterfeiting and other campaigns have destroyed
Plaintiffs' ability to use the Trademark without reversing the confusion and
damage that has already been done.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Compl. � 99.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The plaintiffs have thus alleged facts that raise
the plausible inference that the defendants used the phrase on the Magazine
cover as part of a careful plan that included the Event and the website, and
sought collectively to appropriate the �Own Your Power� mark from the
plaintiffs with knowledge that the plaintiffs owned it and with total disregard
for the plaintiffs' rights. I therefore join the majority's conclusion that a
finding of �good faith� with respect to use of the phrase on the Magazine cover
is inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It remains, of course, for the plaintiffs to prove
their allegations. The evidence may show that the defendants, even knowing of
the plaintiffs' trademark, reasonably believed that the use of the words �Own
Your Power� on the Magazine or elsewhere would confuse no one as to source;
that the use would in any event be a fair one; or that it was not in fact a
calculated part of a more elaborate effort to appropriate the plaintiffs'
property. <i>Cf. Arrow Fastener Co., Inc. v. Stanley Works,</i> 59 F.3d 384,
397 (2d Cir.1995) ( �Prior knowledge of a senior user's trade mark does not
necessarily give rise to an inference of bad faith and may be consistent with
good faith.�); <i>Campbell v. Acuff&#8211;Rose Music Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 569,
585 n.18 (1994) (�Even if good faith were central to [copyright] fair use, 2
Live Crew's actions do not necessarily suggest that they believed their version
was not fair use.... If the use is otherwise fair, then no permission need be
sought or granted.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>2. In a descriptive sense.</i> I would conclude,
if we were called upon to do so on the pleadings alone, that the phrase �Own
Your Power� was used in a �descriptive sense� in connection with the Magazine's
content as a matter of law. I do not think any contrary reading of the
pleadings is plausible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Cosmetically Sealed Indust., Inc. v.
Chesebrough&#8211;Pond's USA Co.,</i> 125 F.3d 28 (2d Cir.1997), the plaintiff
owned the registered trademark SEALED WITH A KISS for its product, a women's
lip gloss. <i>Id.</i> at 29. The defendant used the same phrase, �Seal it With
a Kiss,� in connection with an advertising display for its Cutex brand
lipstick, inviting each prospective customer to leave a print of her lips, with
the Cutex lipstick applied, on a postcard; then to � �[t]ake [it] and send it
to the one you love!!� � <i>Id.</i> We concluded that this use was descriptive
even though it in no way described the color, consistency, or long wear of the
defendant's lip gloss. We decided that the defendant used the phrase in a
descriptive sense because �Seal it With a Kiss� describes �an action that the
sellers hope consumers will take, using their product.� <i>Id.</i> at 30.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Similarly, in <i>B &amp; L Sales Associates v. H.
Daroff &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 421 F.2d 352 (2d Cir.1970), we concluded that the
phrase �Come on Strong,� which was used by the plaintiff as a registered
trademark for a wide variety of products, was used in a descriptive sense by
the defendant in advertisements for its men's clothing line. We reasoned that
the phrase communicates to the prospective customer that defendant's clothing
�would assist the purchaser in projecting a commanding, confident, �strong�
image to his friends and admirers.�<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[13]</span></span></span></a>
<i>Id.</i> at 353. We relied upon this understanding to conclude both that the
use was not likely to cause confusion and that it was a descriptive fair use. <i>Id.</i>
at 354.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Other circuits, by contrast, appear to have adopted
the view of the leading trademark treatise that �to be eligible for a fair use,
defendant must be using the challenged designation in a descriptive, not merely
suggestive, sense.� MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS � 11.45 (citing <i>Breuer Elec. Mfg.
Co. v. Hoover Co.,</i> No. 97 C 7443, 1998 WL 427595 (N.D.Ill. July 23, 1998)).
Thus the effort in <i>Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co.,</i> 978
F.2d 947, 952 (7th Cir.1992), a Seventh Circuit case cited by the majority, to
determine whether the phrase �Gatorade is Thirst Aid� was descriptive or merely
suggestive. <i>See also Fortune Dynamic, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores Brand
Mgmt., Inc.,</i> 618 F.3d 1025, 1042 (9th Cir.2010) (citing MCCARTHY ON
TRADEMARKS � 11.45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The defendants' use of �Own Your Power� on the
Magazine cover fits easily among the uses found to be descriptive in these
cases. The feature story in the October issue is the 2010 O Power List, <i>The
2010 O Power List,</i> O THE OPRAH MAGAZINE, October 2010, at 198, which honors
public figures and other notables who embody certain characteristics of power.
Also inside the Magazine are several shorter articles related to this theme. <i>See</i>
Dr. Phil, <i>Personal Power: 6 Rules for How to Harness Yours, id.</i> at 74
(providing �strategies for tapping your inner power reserves�); <i>How to Light
Up a Room, id.</i> at 214&#8211;16 (theorizing that charisma is the �X factor�
possessed by all of the people featured on the 2010 O Power List). The
descriptive connection is obvious&#8212;indeed, it is difficult to see how any
potential reader with whom the defendants are trying to communicate, upon
picking up the Magazine and reading the coverline, would not expect to find
just these sorts of articles inside. I thus find implausible any assertion that
the phrase �Own Your Power� is not used in a descriptive sense here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority&#8212;although not called upon to do
so in light of our shared view that it is plausible that the Magazine cover, as
part of the defendants' alleged overall plan, was in any event not a fair
use&#8212;finds that the phrase as used specifically on the Magazine cover is
not used in a descriptive sense. The majority apparently does not consider the
feature article, or the �Personal Power� and �Light Up a Room� articles, to
contain �specific advice regarding how a reader can follow in the footsteps� of
the subjects featured on the O Power List, or �advice regarding how a reader
can become more powerful in general,� <i>ante</i> at 312.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if this were a fair characterization of the
Magazine's contents&#8212;and I doubt that it is&#8212;our law has never
required a connection as close and absolute as the majority demands.
Fortunately, the majority leaves open the possibility that the defendants may
adduce evidence of the requisite descriptive connection, perhaps by either (a)
providing a fuller understanding of the sense in which the phrase �Own Your
Power� was used and was likely to be understood by the relevant consumer group,
and thereby illuminating the nexus between that phrase and the Magazine's
contents; or (b) demonstrating that the phrase or phrases like it are commonly
used. I think neither is necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>3. Use other than as a mark.</i> Finally, if we
were considering individually the size, location, and context of the
defendants' use of �Own Your Power!� on the cover of the Magazine, as our law
seems to prescribe, <i>see JA Apparel Corp.,</i> 568 F.3d at 400&#8211;01, it
would be clear to me that the defendants did not use the phrase as a mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The two most prominent items on the cover of the
October issue are the �O The Oprah Magazine� mark in the upper left-hand corner
and the full page photograph of Oprah herself. That �the source of the
defendants' product is clearly identified by the prominent display of the
defendants' own trademarks� is a strong indication that the defendants' use is
other than as a mark. <i>Cosmetically Sealed,</i> 125 F.3d at 30. The size and
location of the phrase, moreover, considered in light of the context of the use
on a magazine cover further suggest that the defendants did not use the phrase
�<i>as a symbol</i> to attract public attention.� <i>JA Apparel,</i> 568 F.3d
at 400 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). A reasonable
consumer would therefore expect the phrase to explain something about the
nature of the contents of this particular issue, not to denote the source of
those contents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But the majority opinion does not consider this use
individually. It concludes instead that the �several unique
instances�&#8212;that is, the use on the Magazine, at the Event, and on the
website&#8212;�collectively constitute use as a mark,� <i>ante</i> at 308,
apparently because �it is plausible that the defendants were attempting to
build up a line of wide-ranging content all denoted by the phrase � Own Your
Power,� � <i>id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Perhaps this somewhat novel theory is useful at
this stage in determining the plausibility of the plaintiffs' factual
allegations.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[14]</span></span></span></a>
But I do not think, and I do not read the majority opinion to mean, that the
mere coincidence of several uses forecloses the possibility that individual
uses are �other than as a mark.� They do, I think, assert that if use of �Own
Your Power� on the Magazine's cover was part of an overall plan to appropriate
the plaintiffs' mark, then to that extent the use on the Magazine may be
actionable. In order to prevail at summary judgment or trial, then, the
plaintiffs must adduce proof in support of that allegation in order to be able
to prevail on the claim relating to the Magazine. They must prove, for example,
that the Magazine use was indeed part of defendants' plan to develop a line of
goods or services under an �Own Your Power� sub-brand, or that relevant
consumers would be likely, perhaps as a result of repetition, to perceive the
phrase on the Magazine �<i>as a symbol</i> to attract public attention,� <i>JA
Apparel,</i> 568 F.3d at 400 (emphasis added), and not just as a coverline
describing the theme of the issue. Whether the plaintiffs can do this, of
course, remains to be seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><span style='font-style:normal'>IV. The Website and the Event</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With respect to the defendants' use of �Own Your
Power� on the website and for the Event, I agree with the majority that the
plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient plausible facts to fend off the fair use
defense on a motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If we were considering the October 2010 issue of
the Magazine alone, I would conclude that the defendants' use of the
trademarked phrase was a �fair� one. I simply do not think we could conclude at
this stage, were we asked to do so, that the allegations in the plaintiffs'
complaint relating to the Magazine coverline <i>considered alone</i> can be
read plausibly to describe a use that is anything other than fair as a matter
of law. A holding to the contrary might endanger the ability of publishers of
all stripes accurately and artfully to describe their publications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But I, like the majority, understand the complaint
not to attack the defendants' use of �Own Your Power!� on the Magazine's cover
alone, but as part of an overall campaign by the defendants in several media to
wrest from the plaintiffs their rights in the mark. It remains possible that a
full record will reveal that despite the multiple uses, any or all of them are
fair uses, and therefore not actionable under the Lanham Act. I thus conclude,
with the majority, that this case must be returned in its entirety to the
district court for further proceedings.</p>

some of which incorporated the flat-edged perforated border design.&nbsp; ISA
sued for trademark infringement.&nbsp; USPS claimed descriptive fair use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Affirming the district court�s grant of summary judgment,
the Eleventh Circuit found descriptive fair use.&nbsp; The court devoted the
bulk of its analysis to the third step, whether USPS�s use was in good faith,
i.e., �whether the alleged infringer intended to trade on the good will of the
trademark owner by creating confusion as to the source of the goods or
services.� <i>Id</i>. at 1275.&nbsp; The court noted that �the overwhelming
majority of stamps the Postal Service produces include perforated edges and
have long done so,� <i>id</i>.; that USPS �prominently places its own familiar
Eagle trademark on the backs of its stamp art products thereby identifying them
as Postal Service products,� <i>id</i>.; and that �ISA has not identified any
evidence that the Postal Service sought to mislead or confuse consumers into
thinking that the source of the cards it produced was actually International
Stamp Art,� <i>id</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ISA claimed that USPS had a �non-infringing, commercially
viable alternative� in the form of �cards depicting the art upon which its
stamp designs was based, rather than the stamps themselves.� <i>Id</i>. at
1276.&nbsp; The Eleventh Circuit recognized that �[f]ailure to employ a non-infringing,
commercially viable alternative can raise a genuine issue of material fact,� <i>id</i>.,
but was ultimately unpersuaded: �This, however, is not an alternative manner of
depicting the stamps, but rather a choice not to depict stamps.� <i>Id</i>.</p>

three-step test to find that Harley Davidson does not use the phrase as a
trademark, �i.e., to identify the source of its products,� <i>Bell</i>, at
1258, and uses the phrase only descriptively.&nbsp; The Court explained:
�Although Bell protests that such a use does not describe a specific
characteristic of Harley's products or goods, courts do not interpret the
Lanham Act's fair use language so narrowly. To the contrary, courts have
applied the fair use doctrine in situations where the defendant's use of the
trademarked phrase described a feeling inherently associated with the phrase or
typically experienced by the consumer upon using defendant's product.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.&nbsp;
The court further found good faith. �Harley&#8211;Davidson demonstrated its
intent not to create confusion by including the Harley&#8211;Davidson name or
bar- &amp; -shield logo on every advertisement and piece of merchandise bearing
the �Ride Hard� phrase.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 1259.&nbsp; Though&nbsp; Bell
pointed out that Wrangler Clothing Company abandoned �Ride Hard� and
substituted �Ride Rough� in response to Bell�s 1999 lawsuit, Harley Davidson
was not obligated to use an alternative phrase under these facts.</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>618 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir. 2010)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Fortune Dynamic, Inc. v. Victoria�s Secret</i>, 618
F.3d 1025 (9th Cir. 2010), Fortune Dynamic sold women�s shoes under the
registered mark delicious in the font shown below on the left.&nbsp; To market
a new line products under the trademark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>beauty
rush</span>, Victoria�s Secret launched a promotion in which anyone who
purchased more than $35 worth of beauty rush products would receive, among
other things, a pink tank top across the chest of which, in silver typescript,
was written the word Delicious as shown below on the right.&nbsp; �On the back,
in much smaller lettering, there appeared the word �yum,� and the phrase �beauty
rush� was written in the back collar.�&nbsp; Id. at 1025.&nbsp; Victoria�s
Secret distributed 602,723 such tank top shirt.&nbsp; Fortune Dynamic sued for
trademark infringement.</p>

<span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'><br

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a lengthy opinion reversing the lower court�s grant of summary
judgment to Victoria�s Secret, the Ninth Circuit first considered the <i>Sleekcraft</i>
factors for the likelihood of consumer confusion and found that a jury could
reasonably find confusion.&nbsp; With respect to Victoria�s Secret�s fair use
defense, the court concluded that a reasonable jury could find that Victoria�s
Secret was using the term �Delicious� as a trademark given the term�s prominent
placement on the front of the shirt, similar to where Victoria�s Secret had
placed two of its own trademarks <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>pink</span>
and <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>very sexy</span>.&nbsp; The court
also found issues of material fact on the question of whether Victoria�s Secret
was using the term �delicious� descriptively:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Victoria's Secret says that it used �Delicious� merely to
�describe the flavorful attributes of Victoria's Secret's BEAUTY RUSH lip gloss
and other products that feature the same popular fruit flavors.� A jury,
however, could reasonably conclude otherwise. For one thing, in its
advertisements, Victoria's Secret described its BEAUTY RUSH lip gloss as
�deliciously sexy,� not delicious. For another, Victoria's Secret's executives
testified that they wanted �Delicious� to serve as a �playful self-descriptor,�
as if the wearer of the pink tank top is saying, �I'm delicious.� These
examples suggest that a jury could reasonably decide that Victoria's Secret did
not use �Delicious� �only to describe its goods.�&nbsp; 15 U.S.C. �
1115(b)(4)�.&nbsp; [A]lthough we accept some flexibility in what counts as
descriptive, we reiterate that the scope of the fair use defense varies with
the level of descriptive purity. Thus, as a defendant's use of a term becomes
less and less purely descriptive, its chances of prevailing on the fair use
defense become less and less likely.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1041-42.&nbsp; The court also noted
Victoria�s Secret�s lack of �precautionary measures� to dispel confusion and
the �abundance of alternative words� that it could have used.&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.
at 1042.&nbsp; On good faith, the court found that Victoria�s Secret�s failure
to investigate whether anyone held a �delicious� trademark, combined with other
evidence, suggested that a jury could reasonably find no good faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ�g, Inc</i>.,
971 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1992), the Ninth Circuit first developed the concept of
nominative fair use &nbsp;The defendants, two newspapers, conducted separate
polls asking readers to call a 900 number to vote for their favorite member of
the boy band New Kids on the Block.&nbsp; As <i>The Star</i> put it: �Which of
the New Kids on the Block would you most like to move next door?�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.
at 305.&nbsp; The band sued for, among other things, trademark
infringement.&nbsp; Affirming the district court�s grant of summary judgment to
the defendants, Judge Kozinski held that a �<em><span style='font-family:Cambria'>nominative
use</span></em> of a mark&#8212;where the only word reasonably available to
describe a particular thing is pressed into service&#8212;lies outside the
strictures of trademark law,� <i>id</i>. at 308 (emphasis in original), and set
out three factors courts should consider to determine if a defendant�s use
qualified as nominative fair use.&nbsp; The Lanham Act did not then explicitly
include any basis for the defense of nominative fair use and even now it only
references nominative fair use in connection with dilution, see �43(c)(3)(A),
15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(3)(A)).&nbsp; On the issue of confusion, the defense
remains essentially judge-made law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note the conceptual distinction between descriptive (or
�classic�) fair use and nominative fair use:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The nominative fair use analysis is appropriate where a
defendant has used the plaintiff's mark to describe the plaintiff's product,
even if the defendant's ultimate goal is to describe his own product.
Conversely, the classic fair use analysis is appropriate where a defendant has
used the plaintiff's mark only to describe his own product, and not at all to
describe the plaintiff's product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the opinion below, now-Chief Judge Kozinski returned to

</span></span>Why should the <i>New Kids</i> factors <i>replace</i> the <i>Sleekcraft</i>
multifactor test for the likelihood of consumer confusion?&nbsp; Why shouldn�t
a court first work through the <i>Sleekcraft</i> test to determine if plaintiff
has even made out its case and, if it has, then turn to the defendant�s
affirmative defense?&nbsp; What sense do you make of the final excerpted
paragraphs of Judge Kozinski�s opinion? How exactly should a Ninth Circuit

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Farzad and Lisa Tabari are auto brokers&#8212;the
personal shoppers of the automotive world. They contact authorized dealers,
solicit bids and arrange for customers to buy from the dealer offering the best
combination of location, availability and price. Consumers like this service,
as <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1175_1"></a>it increases competition among dealers,
resulting in greater selection at lower prices. For many of the same reasons,
auto manufacturers and dealers aren�t so keen on it, as it undermines dealers�
territorial exclusivity and lowers profit margins. Until recently, the Tabaris
offered this service at buy-a-lexus.com and buyorleaselexus.com.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Toyota
Motor Sales U.S.A. (�Toyota�) is the exclusive distributor of Lexus vehicles in
the United States, and jealous guardian of the Lexus mark. A Toyota marketing
executive testified at trial that Toyota spends over $250 million every year
promoting the Lexus brand. In the executive�s estimation, �Lexus is a very
prestigious luxury brand and it is an indication of an exclusive luxury
experience.� No doubt true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Toyota objected to the Tabaris� use on their
website of copyrighted photography of Lexus vehicles and the circular �L Symbol
Design mark.� Toyota also took umbrage at the Tabaris� use of the string
�lexus� in their domain names, which it believed was �likely to cause confusion
as to the source of [the Tabaris�] web site.� The Tabaris removed Toyota�s
photography and logo from their site and added a disclaimer in large font at
the top. But they refused to give up their domain names. Toyota sued, and the
district court found infringement after a bench trial. It ordered the Tabaris
to cease using their domain names and enjoined them from using the Lexus mark
in any other domain name. Pro se as they were at trial, the Tabaris appeal.</p>

Use</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When customers purchase a Lexus through the
Tabaris, they receive a genuine Lexus car sold by an authorized Lexus dealer,
and a portion of the proceeds ends up in Toyota�s bank account. Toyota doesn�t
claim the business of brokering Lexus cars is illegal or that it has contracted
with its dealers to prohibit selling through a broker. Instead, Toyota is using
this trademark lawsuit to make it more difficult for consumers to use the
Tabaris to buy a Lexus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court applied the eight-factor test
for likelihood of confusion articulated in <i>AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats,</i>
599 F.2d 341, 348&#8211;49 (9th Cir. 1979), and found that the Tabaris� domain
names&#8212;buy-a-lexus.com and buyorleaselexus.com&#8212;infringed the Lexus
trademark. But we�ve held that the <i>Sleekcraft</i> analysis doesn�t apply
where a defendant uses the mark to refer to the trademarked good itself. <i>See
Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Welles,</i> 279 F.3d 796, 801 (9th Cir. 2002); <i>New
Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ�g, Inc.,</i> 971 F.2d 302, 308 (9th Cir. 1992).<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[16]</span></span></span></a> The Tabaris are using the
term Lexus to describe their business of brokering Lexus automobiles; when they
say Lexus, they mean Lexus. We�ve long held that such use of the trademark is a
fair use, namely nominative fair use. And fair use is, by definition, not
infringement. The Tabaris did in fact present a nominative fair use defense to
the district court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B12022482255_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In cases where a nominative fair use defense is
raised, we ask whether (1) the product was �readily identifiable� without <a
name="co_pp_sp_506_1176_1"></a>use of the mark; (2) defendant used more of the
mark than necessary; or (3) defendant falsely suggested he was sponsored or
endorsed by the trademark holder. <i>Welles,</i> 279 F.3d at 801 (quoting <i>New
Kids,</i> 971 F.2d at 308&#8211;09). This test �evaluates the likelihood of
confusion in nominative use cases.� <i>Id.</i> It�s designed to address the
risk that nominative use of the mark will inspire a mistaken belief on the part
of consumers that the speaker is sponsored or endorsed by the trademark holder.
The third factor speaks directly to the risk of such confusion, and the others
do so indirectly: Consumers may reasonably infer sponsorship or endorsement if
a company uses an unnecessary trademark or �more� of a mark than necessary. But
if the nominative use satisfies the three-factor <i>New Kids</i> test, it doesn�t
infringe. If the nominative use does not satisfy all the <i>New Kids</i>
factors, the district court may order defendants to modify their use of the
mark so that all three factors are satisfied; it may not enjoin nominative use
of the mark altogether.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00222022482255_ID0"></a><a

The district court enjoined the Tabaris from using �any ... domain name,
service mark, trademark, trade name, meta tag or other commercial indication of
origin that includes the mark LEXUS.� A trademark injunction, particularly one
involving nominative fair use, can raise serious First Amendment concerns
because it can interfere with truthful communication between buyers and sellers
in the marketplace. <i>See Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc.,</i> 425 U.S. 748, 763&#8211;64 (1976). Accordingly, �we must
[e]nsure that [the injunction] is tailored to eliminate only the specific harm
alleged.� <i>E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co.,</i> 967 F.2d 1280,
1297 (9th Cir. 1992). To uphold the broad injunction entered in this case, we
would have to be convinced that consumers are likely to believe a site is
sponsored or endorsed by a trademark holder whenever the domain name contains
the string of letters that make up the trademark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B42022482255_1"></a><a
name="co_anchor_B52022482255_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> In
performing this analysis, our focus must be on the ��reasonably prudent
consumer� in the marketplace.� <i>Cf. Dreamwerks Prod. Grp., Inc. v. SKG
Studio,</i> 142 F.3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir. 1998) (describing the test for
likelihood of confusion in analogous <i>Sleekcraft</i> context). The relevant
marketplace is the online marketplace, and the relevant consumer is a
reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online; the kind of consumer
who is likely to visit the Tabaris� website when shopping for an expensive
product like a luxury car. <i>See, e.g., Interstellar Starship Servs., Ltd. v.
Epix, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 936, 946 (9th Cir. 2002). Unreasonable, imprudent and
inexperienced web-shoppers are not relevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;<a name="co_anchor_B62022482255_1"></a>The
injunction here is plainly overbroad&#8212;as even Toyota�s counsel grudgingly
conceded at oral argument&#8212;because it prohibits domain names that on their
face dispel any confusion as to sponsorship or endorsement. The Tabaris are
prohibited from doing business at sites like independent-lexus-broker.com and
we-are-definitely-not-lexus.com, although a reasonable consumer wouldn�t
believe Toyota sponsors the websites using those domains. Prohibition of such
truthful and non-misleading speech does not advance the Lanham Act�s purpose of
protecting consumers and preventing unfair competition; in fact, it undermines
that rationale by frustrating <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1177_1"></a>honest
communication between the Tabaris and their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if we were to modify the injunction to exclude
domain names that expressly disclaim sponsorship or endorsement (like the
examples above), the injunction would still be too broad. The Tabaris may not do
business at lexusbroker.com, even though that�s the most straightforward,
obvious and truthful way to describe their business. The nominative fair use
doctrine allows such truthful use of a mark, even if the speaker fails to
expressly disavow association with the trademark holder, so long as it�s
unlikely to cause confusion as to sponsorship or endorsement. <i>See Welles,</i>
279 F.3d at 803 n.26. In <i>New Kids,</i> for instance, we found that use of
the �New Kids on the Block� mark in a newspaper survey did not infringe, even
absent a disclaimer, because the survey said �nothing that expressly or by fair
implication connotes endorsement or joint sponsorship.� 971 F.2d at 309.
Speakers are under no obligation to provide a disclaimer as a condition for
engaging in truthful, non-misleading speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although our opinion in <i>Volkswagenwerk
Aktiengesellschaft v. Church</i> remarked on that defendant�s �prominent use of
the word �Independent� whenever the terms �Volkswagen� or �VW� appeared in his
advertising,� 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir. 1969), it isn�t to the contrary. The
inclusion of such words will usually negate any hint of sponsorship or
endorsement, which is why we mentioned them in concluding that there was no infringement
in <i>Volkswagenwerk.</i> <i>Id.</i> But that doesn�t mean such words are
required, and <i>Volkswagenwerk</i> doesn�t say they are. Our subsequent cases
make clear they�re not. <i>See Welles,</i> 279 F.3d at 803 n.26; <i>New Kids,</i>
971 F.2d at 309.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00332022482255_ID0"></a><a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court reasoned that the fact that an
internet domain contains a trademark will �generally� suggest sponsorship or
endorsement by the trademark holder. When a domain name consists <i>only</i> of
the trademark followed by .com, or some other suffix like .org or .net, it will
typically suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. <i>Cf.
Panavision Int�l, L.P. v. Toeppen,</i> 141 F.3d 1316, 1327 (9th Cir. 1998).<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B00442022482255_ID0"></a><a href="#_ftn19"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[19]</span></span></span></a> This is because �[a]
customer <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1178_1"></a>who is unsure about a company�s
domain name will often guess that the domain name is also the company�s name.� <i>Id.</i>
(quoting <i>Cardservice Int�l v. McGee,</i> 950 F.Supp. 737, 741 (E.D.Va. 1997))
(internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Brookfield Commc�ns, Inc. v. W.
Coast Entm�t Corp.,</i> 174 F.3d 1036, 1045 (9th Cir. 1999). If customers type
in trademark.com and find the site occupied by someone other than the trademark
holder, they may well believe it <i>is</i> the trademark holder, despite
contrary evidence on the website itself. Alternatively, they may become
discouraged and give up looking for the trademark holder�s official site,
believing perhaps that such a website doesn�t exist. <i>Panavision,</i> 141
F.3d at 1327.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But the case where the URL consists of nothing but
a trademark followed by a suffix like .com or .org is a special one indeed. <i>See
Brookfield,</i> 174 F.3d at 1057.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B00552022482255_ID0"></a><a href="#_ftn20"
name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[20]</span></span></span></a> The importance ascribed to
trademark.com in fact suggests that far less confusion will result when a domain
making nominative use of a trademark includes characters in addition to those
making up the mark. <i>Cf. Entrepreneur Media, Inc. v. Smith,</i> 279 F.3d
1135, 1146&#8211;47 (9th Cir.2002). Because the official Lexus site is almost
certain to be found at lexus.com (as, in fact, it is), it�s far less likely to
be found at other sites containing the word Lexus. On the other hand, a number
of sites make nominative use of trademarks in their domains but are not
sponsored or endorsed by the trademark holder: You can preen about your
Mercedes at mercedesforum.com and mercedestalk.net, read the latest about your
double-skim-no-whip latte at starbucksgossip.com and find out what goodies the
world�s greatest electronics store has on sale this week at
fryselectronics-ads.com. Consumers who use the internet for shopping are
generally quite sophisticated about such matters and won�t be fooled into
thinking that the prestigious German car manufacturer sells boots at
mercedesboots.com, or homes at mercedeshomes.com, or that comcastsucks.org is
sponsored or endorsed by the TV cable company just because the string of
letters making up its trademark appears in the domain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span

out by typing random URLs containing trademarked words hoping to get a lucky

is unlikely because the consumer will usually be aware of who runs the site
before typing in the URL. And, if the site is located through a search engine,
the consumer will click on the link for a likely-relevant site without paying
much attention to the URL. Use of a trademark in the site�s domain name isn�t
materially different <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1179_1"></a>from use in its text or
metatags in this context; a search engine can find a trademark in a site
regardless of where exactly it appears. In <i>Welles,</i> we upheld a claim
that use of a mark in a site�s metatags constituted nominative fair use; we
reasoned that �[s]earchers would have a much more difficult time locating
relevant websites� if the law outlawed such truthful, non-misleading use of a
mark. 279 F.3d at 804. The same logic applies to nominative use of a mark in a
domain name.</p>

style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Of course a domain name containing a mark cannot be
nominative fair use if it suggests sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark
holder. We�ve already explained why trademark.com domains have that effect. <i>See</i>
pp. 1177&#8211;78 <i>supra.</i> Sites like trademark-USA.com,
trademark-of-glendale.com or e-trademark.com will also generally suggest
sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder; the addition of �e� merely
indicates the electronic version of a brand, and a location modifier following
a trademark indicates that consumers can expect to find the brand�s local
subsidiary, franchise or affiliate. <i>See Visa Int�l Serv. Ass�n v. JSL Corp.,</i>
No. 08&#8211;15206, 2010 WL 2559003, 610 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. June 28, 2010).
For even more obvious reasons, domains like official-trademark-site.com or
we-are-trademark.com affirmatively suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the
trademark holder and are not nominative fair use.<a

injunction is not limited to this narrow class of cases and, indeed, the
Tabaris� domain names do not fall within it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When a domain name making nominative use of a mark
does not actively suggest sponsorship or endorsement, the worst that can happen
is that some consumers may arrive at the site uncertain as to what they will
find. But in the age of FIOS, cable modems, DSL and T1 lines, reasonable,
prudent and experienced internet consumers are accustomed to such exploration
by trial and error. <i>Cf. Interstellar Starship,</i> 304 F.3d at 946. They
skip from site to site, ready to hit the back button whenever they�re not
satisfied with a site�s contents. They fully expect to find some sites that
aren�t what they imagine based on a glance at the domain name or search engine
summary. Outside the special case of trademark.com, or domains that actively
claim affiliation with the trademark holder, consumers don�t form any firm
expectations about the sponsorship of a website until they�ve seen the landing
page&#8212;if then. This is sensible agnosticism, not consumer confusion. <i>See</i>
Jennifer E. Rothman, <i>Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads
of Trademark Law,</i> 27 Cardozo L.Rev. 105, 122&#8211;24, 140, 158 (2005). So
long as the site as a whole does not suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the
trademark holder, such momentary uncertainty does not preclude a finding of
nominative fair use.</p>

the string �lexus� in domain names because it spends hundreds of millions <a

in domain names that would be unfair. It would be unfair to merchants seeking
to communicate the nature of the service or product offered at their sites. And
it would be unfair to consumers, who would be deprived of an increasingly
important means of receiving such information. As noted, this would have
serious First Amendment implications. The only winners would be companies like
Toyota, which would acquire greater control over the markets for goods and
services related to their trademarked brands, to the detriment of competition
and consumers. The nominative fair use doctrine is designed to prevent this
type of abuse of the rights granted by the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <span>B.</span> Toyota asserts that, even if the
district court�s injunction is overbroad, it can be upheld if limited to the
Tabaris� actual domain names: buyorleaselexus.com and buy-a-lexus.com. We
therefore apply the three-part <i>New Kids</i> test to the domain names, and we
start by asking whether the Tabaris� use of the mark was �necessary� to
describe their business. Toyota claims it was not, because the Tabaris could
have used a domain name that did not contain the Lexus mark. It�s true they
could have used some other domain name like autobroker.com or fastimports.com,
or have used the text of their website to explain their business. But it�s
enough to satisfy our test for necessity that the Tabaris needed to communicate
that they specialize in Lexus vehicles, and using the Lexus mark in their
domain names accomplished this goal. While using Lexus in their domain names
wasn�t the only way to communicate the nature of their business, the same could
be said of virtually any choice the Tabaris made about how to convey their
message: Rather than using the internet, they could publish advertisements in
print; or, instead of taking out print ads, they could rely on word of mouth.
We�ve never adopted such a draconian definition of necessity, and we decline to
do so here. In <i>Volkswagenwerk,</i> for instance, we affirmed the right of a
mechanic to put up a sign advertising that he specialized in repairing
Volkswagen cars, although he could have used a sandwich board, distributed
leaflets or shouted through a megaphone. 411 F.2d at 352.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[24]</span></span></span></a> One way or the <a
name="co_pp_sp_506_1181_1"></a>other, the Tabaris need to let consumers know
that they are brokers of Lexus cars, and that�s nearly impossible to do without
mentioning Lexus, <i>cf. </i>&nbsp;<i>Monte Carlo Shirt, Inc. v. Daewoo Int�l
(Am.) Corp.,</i> 707 F.2d 1054, 1058 (9th Cir.1983), be it via domain name,
metatag, radio jingle, telephone solicitation or blimp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fact that the Tabaris also broker other types
of cars does not render their use of the Lexus mark unnecessary.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B010102022482255_ID"></a><a href="#_ftn25"
name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[25]</span></span></span></a> Lisa Tabari testified: �I in
my conviction and great respect for the company always try to convince the
consumer to first purchase a Lexus or Toyota product.� If customers decide to
buy some other type of car, the Tabaris may help with that, but their specialty
is Lexus. The Tabaris are entitled to decide what automotive brands to
emphasize in their business, and the district court found that the Tabaris do
in fact specialize in Lexus vehicles. Potential customers would naturally be
interested in that fact, and it was entirely appropriate for the Tabaris to use
the Lexus mark to let them know it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nor are we convinced by Toyota�s argument that the
Tabaris unnecessarily used domain names containing the Lexus trademark as their
trade name. <i>See Volkswagenwerk,</i> 411 F.2d at 352. The Tabaris� business
name is not buyorleaselexus.com or buy-a-lexus.com; it�s Fast Imports. Toyota
points out that the Tabaris� domain names featured prominently in their
advertising, but that by no means proves the domain names were synonymous with
the Tabaris� business. The Tabaris may have featured their domain names in their
advertisements in order to tell consumers where to find their website, as well
as to communicate the fact that they can help buy or lease a Lexus. Toyota
would have to show significantly more than �prominent� advertisement to
establish the contrary. We therefore conclude that the Tabaris easily satisfy
the first <i>New Kids</i> factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As for the second and third steps of our nominative
fair use analysis, Toyota suggests that use of the stylized Lexus mark and
�Lexus L� logo was more use of the mark than necessary and suggested
sponsorship or endorsement by Toyota. This is true: The Tabaris could
adequately communicate their message without using the visual trappings of the
Lexus brand. <i>New Kids,</i> 971 F.2d at 308 n.7. Moreover, those visual cues
might lead some consumers to believe they were dealing with an authorized
Toyota affiliate. Imagery, logos and other visual markers may be particularly
significant in cyberspace, where anyone can convincingly recreate the look and
feel of a luxury brand at minimal expense. It�s hard to duplicate a Lexus
showroom, but it�s easy enough to ape the Lexus site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But the Tabaris submitted images of an entirely changed
site at the time of trial: The stylized mark and �L� logo were gone, and a
disclaimer appeared in their place. The disclaimer stated, prominently and in
large font, �We are not an authorized Lexus dealer or affiliated in any way
with Lexus. We are an Independent Auto Broker.� <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1182_1"></a>While
not required, such a disclaimer is relevant to the nominative fair use
analysis. <i>See Welles,</i> 279 F.3d at 803. Toyota claims the Tabaris�
disclaimer came too late to protect against confusion caused by their domain
names, as such confusion would occur before consumers saw the site or the
disclaimer. <i>See Brookfield,</i> 174 F.3d at 1057. But nothing about the
Tabaris� domains would give rise to such confusion; the Tabaris did not run
their business at lexus.com, and their domain names did not contain words like
�authorized� or �official.� <i>See</i> pp. 1178&#8211;79 <i>supra.</i>
Reasonable consumers would arrive at the Tabaris� site agnostic as to what they
would find. Once there, they would immediately see the disclaimer and would
promptly be disabused of any notion that the Tabaris� website is sponsored by
Toyota. Because there was no risk of confusion as to sponsorship or
endorsement, the Tabaris� use of the Lexus mark was fair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This makeover of the Tabaris� site is relevant
because Toyota seeks only forward-looking relief. In <i>Volkswagenwerk,</i> we
declined to order an injunction where the defendant had likewise stopped all
infringing activities by the time of trial, 411 F.2d at 352, although we�ve
said that an injunction may be proper if there�s a risk that infringing conduct
will recur, <i>Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Dick Bruhn, Inc.,</i> 793 F.2d 1132,
1135&#8211;36 (9th Cir.1986). Even assuming some form of an injunction is
required to prevent relapse in this case, the proper remedy for infringing use
of a mark on a site generally falls short of entirely prohibiting use of the
site�s domain name, as the district court did here. <i>See Interstellar
Starship,</i> 304 F.3d at 948. �[O]nly upon proving the rigorous elements of
cyber-squatting ... have plaintiffs successfully forced the transfer of an
infringing domain name.� <i>Id.</i> Forced relinquishment of a domain is no
less extraordinary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B102022482255_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court is in a better position to
assess in the first instance the timing and extent of any infringing conduct,
as well as the scope of the remedy, if any remedy should prove to be required.
We therefore vacate the injunction and remand for reconsideration. The important
principle to bear in mind on remand is that a trademark injunction should be
tailored to prevent ongoing violations, not punish past conduct. Speakers do
not lose the right to engage in permissible speech simply because they may have
infringed a trademark in the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <span>C.</span> When considering the scope and
timing of any infringement on remand, the district court must eschew
application of <i>Sleekcraft</i> and analyze the case solely under the rubric
of nominative fair use. <i>Cairns,</i> 292 F.3d at 1151. The district court
treated nominative fair use as an affirmative defense to be established by the
Tabaris only after Toyota showed a likelihood of confusion under <i>Sleekcraft.</i>
This was error; nominative fair use �replaces� <i>Sleekcraft</i> as the proper
test for likely consumer confusion whenever defendant asserts to have referred
to the trademarked good itself. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis omitted); <i>see also
Welles,</i> 279 F.3d at 801.</p>

style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On remand, Toyota must bear the burden of
establishing that the Tabaris� use of the Lexus mark was <i>not</i> nominative
fair use. A finding of nominative fair use is a finding that the plaintiff has
failed to show a likelihood of confusion as to sponsorship or endorsement. <i>See
Welles,</i> 279 F.3d at 801; <i>New Kids,</i> 971 F.2d at 308 (�Because
[nominative fair use] does not implicate the source-identification function
that is the purpose of trademark, it does <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1183_1"></a>not

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[26]</span></span></span></a> And, as the Supreme Court
has unambiguously instructed, the Lanham Act always places the �burden of
proving likelihood of confusion ... on the party charging infringement.� <i>KP
Permanent Make&#8211;Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.,</i> 543 U.S. 111,
118 (2004); <i>see also id.</i> at 120&#8211;21. In this case, that party is
Toyota. �[A]ll the [Tabaris] need[ ] to do is to leave the factfinder
unpersuaded.� <i>Id.</i> at 120.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have previously said the opposite: �[T]he nominative
fair use defense shifts to the defendant the burden of proving no likelihood of
confusion.� <i>Brother Records, Inc.,</i> 318 F.3d at 909 n.5. But that rule is
plainly inconsistent with <i>Lasting Impression</i> and has been �effectively
overruled.� <i>Miller v. Gammie,</i> 335 F.3d 889, 893 (9th Cir.2003) (en
banc); <i>see also</i> 4 <i>McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i> �
23:11 at 82 n.5 (4th ed.2010). A defendant seeking to assert nominative fair
use as a defense need only show that it used the mark to refer to the trademarked
good, as the Tabaris undoubtedly have here. The burden then reverts to the
plaintiff to show a likelihood of confusion.</p>

not see the basis for the majority�s assertion that the �relevant consumer is

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span

slap at counsel for Toyota in the majority opinion,<a

of the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, I do not join the final textual paragraph,
which nudges the district court to find pro bono counsel for the Tabaris, who
have neither chosen to retain their own counsel nor demonstrated that they
cannot do so. To the extent that the majority sees their activities as
especially socially worthy and above reproach, I do not agree.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Sack, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>For the facts of the </i>Tiffany <i>opinion, see Part
II.E</i>.]</p>

<p class=Centered>I. Direct Trademark Infringement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tiffany alleges that eBay infringed its trademark
in violation of section 32 of the Lanham Act. The district court described this
as a claim of �direct trademark infringement,� <i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at
493, and we adopt that terminology� </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the district court, Tiffany argued that eBay had
directly infringed its mark by using it on eBay's website and by purchasing
sponsored links containing the mark on Google and Yahoo! <i>Tiffany,</i> 576
F.Supp.2d at 494. Tiffany also argued that eBay and the sellers of the
counterfeit goods using its site were jointly and severally liable. <i>Id.</i>
The district court rejected these arguments on the ground that eBay's use of
Tiffany's mark was protected by the doctrine of nominative fair use. <i>Id.</i>
at 494-95.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The doctrine of nominative fair use allows �[a]
defendant [to] use a plaintiff's trademark to identify the plaintiff's goods so
long as there is no likelihood of confusion about the source of [the]
defendant's product or the mark-holder's sponsorship or affiliation.� <i>Merck
&amp; Co. v. Mediplan Health Consulting, Inc.,</i> 425 F.Supp.2d 402, 413
(S.D.N.Y.2006). The doctrine apparently originated in the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit. <i>See New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ'g, Inc.,</i>
971 F.2d 302 (9th Cir.1992). To fall within the protection, according to that
court: �First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable
without use of the trademark; second, only so much of the mark or marks may be
used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and third,
the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest
sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.� <i>Id.</i> at 308.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has
endorsed these principles. <i>See Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Lendingtree,
Inc.,</i> 425 F.3d 211, 222 (3d Cir.2005).<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[27]</span></span></span></a>
We have referred to the doctrine, albeit without adopting or rejecting it. <i>See,
e.g., Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc.,</i> 282 F.3d 147, 156 (2d Cir.2002)
(noting that the district court had �[a]ppl [ied] the standard for
non-trademark or �nominative� fair use set forth by the Ninth Circuit�). Other
circuits have done similarly. <i>See, e.g., Univ. Commc'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos,
Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d 413, 424 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Pebble Beach Co. v. Tour 18 I
Ltd.,</i> 155 F.3d 526, 547 (5th Cir.1998), <i>abrogated on other grounds by
TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 23 (2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We need not address the viability of the doctrine
to resolve Tiffany's claim, however. We have recognized that a defendant may
lawfully use a plaintiff's trademark where doing so is necessary to describe
the plaintiff's product and does not imply a false affiliation or endorsement
by the plaintiff of the defendant. �While a trademark conveys an exclusive
right to the use of a mark in commerce in the area reserved, that right
generally does not prevent one who trades a branded product from accurately
describing it by its brand name, so long as the trader does not create
confusion by implying an affiliation with the owner of the product.� <i>Dow
Jones &amp; Co. v. Int'l Sec. Exch., Inc.,</i> 451 F.3d 295, 308 (2d Cir.2006);
<i>see also Polymer Tech. Corp. v. Mimran,</i> 975 F.2d 58, 61-62 (2d Cir.1992)
(�As a general rule, trademark law does not reach the sale of genuine goods

(footnote omitted)); <i>cf. Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty,</i> 264 U.S. 359, 368

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the district court that eBay's use of
Tiffany's mark on its website and in sponsored links was lawful. eBay used the
mark to describe accurately the genuine Tiffany goods offered for sale on its
website. And none of eBay's uses of the mark suggested that Tiffany affiliated
itself with eBay or endorsed the sale of its products through eBay's website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition, the �About Me� page that Tiffany has
maintained on eBay's website since 2004 states that �[m]ost of the purported
�TIFFANY &amp; CO.� silver jewelry and packaging available on eBay is
counterfeit.� <i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 479 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The page further explained that Tiffany itself sells its products
only through its own stores, catalogues, and website. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tiffany argues, however, that even if eBay had the
right to use its mark with respect to the resale of genuine Tiffany
merchandise, eBay infringed the mark because it knew or had reason to know that
there was �a substantial problem with the sale of counterfeit [Tiffany] silver
jewelry� on the eBay website. Appellants' Br. 45. As we discuss below, eBay's
knowledge <i>vel non</i> that counterfeit Tiffany wares were offered through
its website is relevant to the issue of whether eBay contributed to the direct
infringement of Tiffany's mark by the counterfeiting vendors themselves, or
whether eBay bears liability for false advertising. But it is not a basis for a
claim of direct trademark infringement against eBay, especially inasmuch as it
is undisputed that eBay promptly removed all listings that Tiffany challenged
as counterfeit and took affirmative steps to identify and remove illegitimate
Tiffany goods. To impose liability because eBay cannot guarantee the
genuineness of all of the purported Tiffany products offered on its website would
unduly inhibit the lawful resale of genuine Tiffany goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

the described manner did not constitute direct trademark infringement.</p>

<p class=Centered><b>Questions and Comments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Ninth
Circuit�s Burden Shifting Approach</i>.&nbsp; McCarthy has parsed the
burden-shifting language of <i>Tabari</i> as follows: �The Ninth Circuit has
made it clear that a defendant who raises the nominative fair use issue need
only show that it uses the mark to refer to the plaintiff's trademarked goods
or services. The burden then reverts to the plaintiff to show a likelihood of
confusion under the nominative fair use analysis�.&nbsp; In the Ninth Circuit
and in other circuits that follow its approach, the �nominative fair use�
analysis is a �defense� only in the sense that an accused infringer in certain
cases can use the analysis to argue that there will be no infringement because
there will be no likelihood of confusion.� <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
� 23:11 (footnote omitted).&nbsp; Does this clarify the approach of the Ninth
Circuit and other circuits that follow it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Why Should the </i>New
Kids<i> factors replace the </i>Sleekcraft<i> test</i>?&nbsp; In <i>Board of
Supervisors for Louisiana State University Agricultural and Mechanical College
v. Smack Apparel Co</i>., 550 F.3d 465, the Fifth Circuit evaluated the
defendant�s nominative fair use claim under two factors ultimately adapted from
<i>New Kids</i>: �In order to avail oneself of the nominative fair use defense �the
defendant (1) may only use so much of the mark as necessary to identify the
product or service and (2) may not do anything that suggests affiliation,
sponsorship, or endorsement by the markholder.�� (quoting Pebble Beach Co. v.
Tour 18 I Ltd., 155 F.3d 526, 546 (5th Cir. 1998)).&nbsp; In elaborating on the
nature of the nominative fair use defense, the <i>Smack Apparel</i> court
offered one explanation for why the nominative fair use test should replace the
traditional multifactor test for the likelihood of confusion: �We have held
that a nominative fair use claim is a claim that a mark's use is noninfringing
and therefore creates no likelihood of confusion. Thus, we have also said that
a court ordinarily should consider a nominative fair use claim in conjunction
with its likelihood-of-confusion analysis in order to avoid lowering the
standard for confusion.� <i>Smack Apparel</i>, 550 F.3d at 488-89 (footnote
omitted).&nbsp; Does this strike you as a persuasive justification?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Third
Circuit�s Hybrid Approach in</i> Century&nbsp; 21.&nbsp; In <i>Century 21 Real
Estate Corp. v. Lendingtree, Inc</i>., 425 F.3d 211 (3d Cir. 2005), the Third
Circuit rejected the Ninth Circuit�s approach in which the <i>New Kids</i>
factors replace the multifactor test for the likelihood of consumer
confusion.&nbsp; Instead, seeking properly to cast the nominative fair use
�defense� as a true affirmative defense, the Century 21 court set forth four
factors Third Circuit courts should consider in the nominative fair use context
to determine if there was a likelihood of confusion: �(1) the price of the
goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of
consumers when making a purchase; (2) the length of time the defendant has used
the mark without evidence of actual confusion; (3) the intent of the defendant
in adopting the mark; and (4) the evidence of actual confusion.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.
at 225-26.&nbsp; If the plaintiff meets its burden of proving a likelihood of
confusion under these factors, then the defendant bears the burden of winning
each of the following factors to make out the defense of nominative fair use: �1.
Is the use of plaintiff's mark necessary to describe (1) plaintiff's product or
service and (2) defendant's product or service?&nbsp; 2. Is only so much of the
plaintiff's mark used as is necessary to describe plaintiff's products or
services? 3. Does the defendant's conduct or language reflect the true and
accurate relationship between plaintiff and defendant's products or services?� <i>Id</i>.
at 228.&nbsp; Dissenting, Judge Fisher was highly critical of this new
approach.&nbsp; <i>See id</i>. at 232 (Fisher, J., dissenting).</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>8 F. Supp. 2d 398 (D.N.J. 1998)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Liquid Glass Enterprises, Inc. v. Dr. Ing. h.c.F.
Porsche AG</i>, 8 F. Supp. 2d 398 (D.N.J. 1998), the declaratory plaintiff
Liquid Glass ran numerous advertisements incorporating Porsche
automobiles.&nbsp; The court focused on two.&nbsp; The first was �an ad
appearing in the May 1997 issue of a national car magazine, <i>Motor Trend</i>,
which portrays a provocatively-dressed woman applying Liquid Glass car polish
to a Porsche 911 with the trademark �PORSCHE� prominently displayed on the car.�
<i>Id</i>. at 399.&nbsp; The second was a ten-minute video for use at trade
shows that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>opens with a Porsche 911 (with the Porsche crest plainly
visible) accelerating down a highway. Immediately following, the video cuts to
a woman who is undressing and taking a shower. Thereafter, the video cuts
alternately between a car (not a Porsche) being washed and polished and a woman
showering, putting on her makeup and getting dressed. The video then
illustrates Liquid Glass's uses on numerous expensive cars and ends with a shot
of the Porsche 911 speeding down the road.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 400.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Applying <i>New Kids</i>, the court found no nominative fair
use and ultimately granted the declaratory defendant�s preliminary injunction
motion.&nbsp; As to the first factor, �Liquid Glass has asserted no reason why
the Porsche trademark or trade dress is necessary in its promotion of Liquid
Glass products.� <i>Id</i>. at 402.&nbsp; As to the second factor, �[n]either
does Liquid Glass use only so much of Porsche's trademarks and trade dress as
is reasonably necessary. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft
v. Church</i>, 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir.1969) (repair shop can only use the
word �Volkswagen� but cannot use the distinctive lettering or the encircled �VW�
emblem)�. <i>Id</i>. at&nbsp; 402-403.&nbsp; As to the third <i>New Kids</i>
factor, the court then proceeded through the Third Circuit�s <i>Scott Paper</i>
multifactor test for consumer confusion to find that �Liquid Glass's advertisements
could mislead the public into believing that Porsche endorsed Liquid Glass's
products or at least approved of their use on Porsche automobiles.� <i>Id</i>.
at 403.&nbsp; (The court also found dilution by blurring).</p>

<p class=MsoHeading7><a name="_Toc392010418">Toho Co., Ltd. v. William Morrow
&amp; Co., Inc.</a></p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>33 F. Supp. 2d 1206 (C.D. Cal. 1998)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Toho Co., Ltd. v. William Morrow &amp; Co., Inc</i>.,
33 F. Supp. 2d 1206 (C.D. Cal. 1998), Toho was the producer of and intellectual
property rights holder in the Godzilla motion pictures.&nbsp; The defendant
planned to release a 227-page Godzilla compendium book entitled �Godzilla!�,
the title of which was �written in the distinctive lettering style used by Toho
and its licensees in their merchandising activities.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at
1209.&nbsp; Toho moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Applying <i>New Kids</i>, the court found, on factor one,
that �[t]he product (the Godzilla character) is one not readily identifiable
without the use of the trademark. A �giant sized pre-historic dragon-like
monster� may be an adequate description of Plaintiff's product, but use of the
�Godzilla� mark is required to readily identify Plaintiff's product.� Id. at
1211.&nbsp; However, on factor two, �the cover of the Morrow Book contains
Toho's trademark in bold orange lettering prominently displayed. This prong of
the test does not appear to be satisfied because Morrow's use exceeds its
legitimate referential purpose.�&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; On the third New Kids factor,
the court proceeded through the Ninth Circuit�s <i>Sleekcraft</i> test for the
likelihood of consumer confusion to find that �consumer confusion is likely.� <i>Id</i>.
at 1215.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a separate discussion (placed after its analysis of the
first and second New Kids Factors but before its <i>Sleekcraft</i> analysis),
the court found that the defendant�s disclaimers on the front and back of the
book were ineffective.&nbsp; The court described the disclaimers:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>On the front cover, the word �UNAUTHORIZED� appears at the
very top of the page, in relatively small lettering, surrounded by an orange
bordering. On the back cover the following disclaimer appears, highlighted by
its appearance against a blue background: �THIS BOOK WAS NOT PREPARED,
APPROVED, LICENSED OR ENDORSED BY ANY ENTITY INVOLVED IN CREATING OR PRODUCING
ANY GODZILLA MOVIE, INCLUDING COLUMBIA/TRISTAR AND TOHO CO. LTD.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1212.&nbsp; The court concluded:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>This Court finds that the disclaimers do not alleviate the
potential for consumer confusion. The word �UNAUTHORIZED� on the front cover
only conveys a limited amount of information. It is not necessarily clear that
alerting the average consumer to the word �UNAUTHORIZED� would negate consumer
confusion as to Toho's sponsorship or endorsement of the Morrow Book. As the
court in T<i>win Peaks Productions v. Publications Intern</i>., 996 F.2d 1366,
1379 (2nd Cir.1993) stated, the disclaimer would have been far more effective
had it simply stated �that the publication has not been prepared, approved, or
licensed by any entity that created or produced the� original Toho Godzilla
films. That this information is conveyed on the back cover does not suffice.
This Court is of the belief that most consumers look primarily at the front
cover of a book prior to purchase. Moreover, the color of the disclaimer on the
front cover does not effectively draw the attention of the average consumer as
its bordering is in the same shade as the title. Further, the word is placed at
the top of the page where most consumers' eyes are not likely to dwell. Perhaps
if the information contained on the back cover were placed on the front cover,
consumer confusion could be negated. The disclaimer is also not placed on the
spine of the Morrow Book, a place where many consumers are likely to view
before seeing the cover. Toho also asserts that the advertisement for the
Morrow Book placed on the Internet at sites such as �Amazon.com� does not even
contain the disclaimer. In summary, this Court finds that the disclaimers are
ineffective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider, by contrast, the approach taken by the following

<h2><a name="_Toc392010419"><a name="_Toc371536071">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expressive
Uses of Trademarks</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We use the term �expressive� to denote the great variety of unauthorized
uses of marks for purposes such as parody, criticism, or social commentary, be they
for-profit or entirely non-commercial in nature. Unlike copyright law and its
doctrine of copyright fair use, trademark law has no one-size-fits-all doctrine
to address the permissibility of such expressive uses.&nbsp; Further
complicating matters is that any particular expressive use must be analyzed
both for the likelihood that it will cause consumer confusion and for the
likelihood that it will cause trademark dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Part III.C.1, we turn first to a leading example of a
court�s analysis of a for-profit parodic use both under the multifactor test
for the likelihood of consumer confusion and the test under Lanham Act � 43(c),
15 U.S.C. � 1125(c), for the likelihood of trademark blurring and trademark
tarnishment.&nbsp; <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC</i>,
507 F.3d 252 (4th Cir. 2007), is a lengthy opinion that is presented here
almost in full, but it will reward a thorough reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We then turn in Part III.C.2 to the <i>Rogers v. Grimaldi</i>
test for artistically relevant uses of trademarks.&nbsp; In recent years, this
test has become increasingly influential as a replacement for the likelihood of
confusion test in expressive use situations.&nbsp; Note importantly, however,
that the <i>Rogers v. Grimaldi</i> test limits itself only to the question of
consumer confusion.&nbsp; It does not address the additional question of
whether the expressive use blurs or tarnishes the targeted mark.&nbsp; On that
issue, a typical defendant may seek to avail itself of the �Exclusions� from
antidilution protection provided by Lanham Act � 43(c)(3), 15 U.S.C.
1125(c)(3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part III.C.3 provides summaries of further examples of
expressive use cases and controversies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One final preliminary comment, going to the limits of the
reading in this subpart: for all of the elaborate doctrine that is meant to
limit plaintiffs� trademark rights and allow defendants� expressive uses, the
fact is that defendants often cannot afford to avail themselves of these
limits. They often settle rather than bankrupt themselves through
litigation.&nbsp; Consider one example of this sad reality:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Seal Press, a small book publisher that specializes in
non-fiction and fiction by women writers, published a book, �Adios, Barbie,�
that examined body image from a feminist perspective [image of first edition
book cover shown below on left].&nbsp; Seal was sued by Mattel for dilution.
Commenting on the suit, the Seal Press publisher said �[w]e thought the First
Amendment provided us with every right to evoke the outrageousness of tall,
thin, and white being the only widely accepted body type.� But Mattel
overwhelmed the small press. In a settlement, Seal agreed to remove Barbie's
name from the book's title and to remove images of the doll's clothing and
accoutrements from its cover. �We are a small publisher,� said the publisher.
�We're not insured for the costs associated with this type of lawsuit.�</p>

Power of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995</i>, 11 <span

<p class=MsoNormal>There is simply no question that if Seal Press had had the
resources to litigate the matter, it would have prevailed with respect to both
confusion and dilution against Mattel &#8212; whose reputation for scorched-earth
litigation tactics is matched only by its reputation for almost always losing
in court against those who stand up to its bullying.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Mattel

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A., a French corporation
located in Paris, that manufactures luxury luggage, handbags, and accessories,
commenced this action against Haute Diggity Dog, LLC, a Nevada corporation that
manufactures and sells pet products nationally, alleging trademark infringement
under 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a), trademark dilution under 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c),
copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. � 501, and related statutory and common
law violations. Haute Diggity Dog manufactures, among other things, plush toys
on which dogs can chew, which, it claims, parody famous trademarks on luxury
products, including those of Louis Vuitton Malletier. The particular Haute
Diggity Dog chew toys in question here are small imitations of handbags that
are labeled �Chewy Vuiton� and that mimic Louis Vuitton Malletier's LOUIS

successful parodies of Louis Vuitton Malletier's trademarks, designs, and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. (�LVM�) is a well
known manufacturer of luxury luggage, leather goods, handbags, and accessories,
which it markets and sells worldwide. In connection with the sale of its
products, LVM has adopted trademarks and trade dress that are well recognized
and have become famous and distinct. Indeed, in 2006, <i>BusinessWeek</i>
ranked LOUIS VUITTON as the 17th �best brand� of all corporations in the world
and the first �best brand� for any fashion business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> LVM has registered trademarks for �LOUIS VUITTON,�
in connection with luggage and ladies' handbags (the �LOUIS VUITTON mark�); for
a stylized monogram of �LV,� in connection with traveling bags and other goods
(the �LV mark�); and for a monogram canvas design consisting of a canvas with repetitions
of the LV mark along with four-pointed stars, four-pointed stars inset in
curved diamonds, and four-pointed flowers inset in circles, in connection with
traveling bags and other products (the �Monogram Canvas mark�). In 2002, LVM
adopted a brightly-colored version of the Monogram Canvas mark in which the LV
mark and the designs were of various colors and the background was white (the
�Multicolor design�), created in collaboration with Japanese artist Takashi
Murakami. For the Multicolor design, LVM obtained a copyright in 2004. In 2005,
LVM adopted another design consisting of a canvas with repetitions of the LV
mark and smiling cherries on a brown background (the �Cherry design�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As LVM points out, the Multicolor design and the
Cherry design attracted immediate and extraordinary media attention and
publicity in magazines such as <i>Vogue, W, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Us Weekly,
Life and Style, Travel &amp; Leisure, People, In Style,</i> and <i>Jane.</i>
The press published photographs showing celebrities carrying these handbags,
including Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Eve, Elizabeth Hurley, Carmen Electra, and
Anna Kournikova, among others. When the Multicolor design first appeared in
2003, the magazines typically reported, �The Murakami designs for Louis
Vuitton, which were the hit of the summer, came with hefty price tags and a
long waiting list.� <i>People Magazine</i> said, �the wait list is in the
thousands.� The handbags retailed in the range of $995 for a medium handbag to
$4500 for a large travel bag. The medium size handbag that appears to be the
model for the �Chewy Vuiton� dog toy retailed for $1190. The Cherry design
appeared in 2005, and the handbags including that design were priced
similarly&#8212;in the range of $995 to $2740. LVM does not currently market
products using the Cherry design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The original LOUIS VUITTON, LV, and Monogram Canvas
marks, however, have been used as identifiers of LVM products continuously
since 1896.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> During the period 2003&#8211;2005, LVM spent more
than $48 million advertising products using its marks and designs, including
more than $4 million for the Multicolor design. It sells its products
exclusively in LVM stores and in its own in-store boutiques that are contained
within department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, Neiman
Marcus, and Macy's. LVM also advertises its products on the Internet through
the specific websites www.louisvuitton.com and www. eluxury. com.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although better known for its handbags and luggage,
LVM also markets a limited selection of luxury pet accessories&#8212;collars,
leashes, and dog carriers&#8212;which bear the Monogram Canvas mark and the
Multicolor design. These items range in price from approximately $200 to $1600.
LVM does not make dog toys.</p>

&amp; Co. (Tiffany &amp; Co.), and Dogior (Dior). The chew toys and pet beds
are plush, made of polyester, and have a shape and design that loosely imitate
the signature product of the targeted brand. They are mostly distributed and
sold through pet stores, although one or two Macy's stores carries Haute
Diggity Dog's products. The dog toys are generally sold for less than $20,
although larger versions of some of Haute Diggity Dog's plush dog beds sell for
more than $100.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> Haute Diggity Dog's �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys, in
particular, loosely resemble miniature handbags and undisputedly evoke LVM
handbags of similar shape, design, and color. In lieu of the LOUIS VUITTON
mark, the dog toy uses �Chewy Vuiton�; in lieu of the LV mark, it uses �CV�;
and the other symbols and colors employed are imitations, but not exact ones,
of those used in the LVM Multicolor and Cherry designs.</p>

defendants Haute Diggity Dog; Victoria D.N. Dauernheim, the principal owner of
Haute Diggity Dog; and Woofies, LLC, a retailer of Haute Diggity Dog's
products, located in Asburn, Virginia, for trademark, trade dress, and
copyright infringement. Its complaint includes counts for trademark counterfeiting,
under 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a); trademark infringement, under 15 U.S.C. �
1114(1)(a); trade dress infringement, under 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1); unfair

� 59.1&#8211;200. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court
granted Haute Diggity Dog's motion and denied LVM's motion, entering judgment
in favor of Haute Diggity Dog on all of the claims. It rested its analysis on
each count principally on the conclusion that Haute Diggity Dog's products
amounted to a successful parody of LVM's marks, trade dress, and copyright. See

<p class=Centered>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> LVM contends first that Haute Diggity Dog's
marketing and sale of its �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys infringe its trademarks
because the advertising and sale of the �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys is likely to
cause confusion. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a). LVM argues:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The defendants in this case are using almost an exact
imitation of the house mark VUITTON (merely omitting a second �T�), and they
painstakingly copied Vuitton's Monogram design mark, right down to the exact
arrangement and sequence of geometric symbols. They also used the same design
marks, trade dress, and color combinations embodied in Vuitton's Monogram
Multicolor and Monogram Cerises [Cherry] handbag collections. Moreover, HDD did
not add any language to distinguish its products from Vuitton's, and its
products are not �widely recognized.�<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[28]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Haute Diggity Dog contends that there is no
evidence of confusion, nor could a reasonable factfinder conclude that there is
a likelihood of confusion, because it successfully markets its products as
parodies of famous marks such as those of LVM. It asserts that �precisely
because of the [famous] mark's fame and popularity ... confusion is avoided,
and it is this lack of confusion that a parodist depends upon to achieve the
parody.� Thus, responding to LVM's claims of trademark infringement, Haute
Diggity Dog argues:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The marks are undeniably similar in certain respects. There
are visual and phonetic similarities. [Haute Diggity Dog] admits that the
product name and design mimics LVM's and is based on the LVM marks. It is
necessary for the pet products to conjure up the original designer mark for
there to be a parody at all. However, a parody also relies on �equally obvious
dissimilarit[ies] between the marks� to produce its desired effect.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Concluding that Haute Diggity Dog did not create any
likelihood of confusion as a matter of law, the district court granted summary
judgment to Haute Diggity Dog. <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier,</i> 464 F.Supp.2d at
503, 508. We review its order <i>de novo. See CareFirst of Md., Inc. v. First
Care, P.C.,</i> 434 F.3d 263, 267 (4th Cir.2006).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To prove trademark infringement, LVM must show (1)
that it owns a valid and protectable mark; (2) that Haute Diggity Dog uses a
�re-production, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation� of that mark in
commerce and without LVM's consent; and (3) that Haute Diggity Dog's use is
likely to cause confusion. 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a); <i>CareFirst,</i> 434 F.3d
at 267. The validity and protectability of LVM's marks are not at issue in this
case, nor is the fact that Haute Diggity Dog uses a colorable imitation of
LVM's mark. Therefore, we give the first two elements no further attention. To
determine whether the �Chewy Vuiton� product line creates a likelihood of
confusion, we have identified several nonexclusive factors to consider: (1) the
strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark; (2) the similarity of the
two marks; (3) the similarity of the goods or services the marks identify; (4)
the similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses; (5)
the similarity of the advertising used by the two parties; (6) the defendant's
intent; and (7) actual confusion. <i>See Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple,</i> 747
F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984). These <i>Pizzeria Uno</i> factors are not
always weighted equally, and not all factors are relevant in every case. <i>See
CareFirst,</i> 434 F.3d at 268.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because Haute Diggity Dog's arguments with respect
to the <i>Pizzeria Uno</i> factors depend to a great extent on whether its
products and marks are successful parodies, we consider first whether Haute
Diggity Dog's products, marks, and trade dress are indeed successful parodies
of LVM's marks and trade dress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For trademark purposes, �[a] �parody� is defined as
a simple form of entertainment conveyed by juxtaposing the irreverent
representation of the trademark with the idealized image created by the mark's
owner.� <i>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney</i> (�<i>PETA</i>
�), 263 F.3d 359, 366 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). �A
parody must convey two simultaneous&#8212;and contradictory&#8212;messages:
that it is the original, but also that it is <i>not</i> the original and is
instead a parody.� <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
This second message must not only differentiate the alleged parody from the
original but must also communicate some articulable element of satire,
ridicule, joking, or amusement. Thus, �[a] parody relies upon a difference from
the original mark, presumably a humorous difference, in order to produce its
desired effect.� <i>Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v. Hogg Wyld, Ltd.,</i> 828 F.2d
1482, 1486 (10th Cir.1987) (finding the use of �Lardashe� jeans for larger
women to be a successful and permissible parody of �Jordache� jeans).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When applying the <i>PETA</i> criteria to the facts
of this case, we agree with the district court that the �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys
are successful parodies of LVM handbags and the LVM marks and trade dress used
in connection with the marketing and sale of those handbags. First, the pet
chew toy is obviously an irreverent, and indeed intentional, representation of
an LVM handbag, albeit much smaller and coarser. The dog toy is shaped roughly
like a handbag; its name �Chewy Vuiton� sounds like and rhymes with LOUIS
VUITTON; its monogram CV mimics LVM's LV mark; the repetitious design clearly
imitates the design on the LVM handbag; and the coloring is similar. In short,
the dog toy is a small, plush imitation of an LVM handbag carried by women,
which invokes the marks and design of the handbag, albeit irreverently and
incompletely. No one can doubt that LVM handbags are the target of the
imitation by Haute Diggity Dog's �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the same time, no one can doubt also that the
�Chewy Vuiton� dog toy is not the �idealized image� of the mark created by LVM.
The differences are immediate, beginning with the fact that the �Chewy Vuiton�
product is a dog toy, not an expensive, luxury LOUIS VUITTON handbag. The toy
is smaller, it is plush, and virtually all of its designs differ. Thus, �Chewy
Vuiton� is not LOUIS VUITTON (�Chewy� is not �LOUIS� and �Vuiton� is not
�VUITTON,� with its two Ts); CV is not LV; the designs on the dog toy are
simplified and crude, not detailed and distinguished. The toys are inexpensive;
the handbags are expensive and marketed to be expensive. And, of course, as a
dog toy, one must buy it with pet supplies and cannot buy it at an exclusive
LVM store or boutique within a department store. In short, the Haute Diggity
Dog �Chewy Vuiton� dog toy undoubtedly and deliberately conjures up the famous
LVM marks and trade dress, but at the same time, it communicates that it is not
the LVM product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, the juxtaposition of the similar and
dissimilar&#8212;the irreverent representation and the idealized image of an
LVM handbag&#8212;immediately conveys a joking and amusing parody. The furry
little �Chewy Vuiton� imitation, as something to be <i>chewed by a dog,</i>
pokes fun at the elegance and expensiveness of a LOUIS VUITTON handbag, which
must <i>not</i> be chewed by a dog. The LVM handbag is provided for the most
elegant and well-to-do celebrity, to proudly display to the public and the
press, whereas the imitation �Chewy Vuiton� �handbag� is designed to mock the
celebrity and be used by a dog. The dog toy irreverently presents haute couture
as an object for casual canine destruction. The satire is unmistakable. The dog
toy is a comment on the rich and famous, on the LOUIS VUITTON name and related
marks, and on conspicuous consumption in general. This parody is enhanced by
the fact that �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys are sold with similar parodies of other
famous and expensive brands&#8212;�Chewnel No. 5� targeting �Chanel No. 5�;
�Dog Perignonn� targeting �Dom Perignon�; and �Sniffany &amp; Co.� targeting
�Tiffany &amp; Co.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We conclude that the <i>PETA</i> criteria are amply
satisfied in this case and that the �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys convey �just enough
of the original design to allow the consumer to appreciate the point of
parody,� but stop well short of appropriating the entire marks that LVM claims.
<i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 366 (quoting <i>Jordache,</i> 828 F.2d at 1486).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finding that Haute Diggity Dog's parody is
successful, however, does not end the inquiry into whether Haute Diggity Dog's
�Chewy Vuiton� products create a likelihood of confusion. <i>See</i> 6 J.
Thomas McCarthy, <i>Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i> � 31:153, at 262 (4th
ed. 2007) (�There are confusing parodies and non-confusing parodies. All they
have in common is an attempt at humor through the use of someone else's
trademark�). The finding of a successful parody only influences the way in
which the <i>Pizzeria Uno</i> factors are applied. <i>See, e.g., Anheuser&#8211;Busch,
Inc. v. L &amp; L Wings, Inc.,</i> 962 F.2d 316, 321 (4th Cir.1992) (observing
that parody alters the likelihood-of-confusion analysis). Indeed, it becomes
apparent that an effective parody will actually diminish the likelihood of
confusion, while an ineffective parody does not. We now turn to the <i>Pizzeria
Uno</i> factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As to the first <i>Pizzeria Uno</i> factor, the
parties agree that LVM's marks are strong and widely recognized. They do not
agree, however, as to the consequences of this fact. LVM maintains that a
strong, famous mark is entitled, as a matter of law, to broad protection. While
it is true that finding a mark to be strong and famous usually favors the
plaintiff in a trademark infringement case, the opposite may be true when a
legitimate claim of parody is involved. As the district court observed, �In
cases of parody, a strong mark's fame and popularity is precisely the mechanism
by which likelihood of confusion is avoided.� <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier,</i>
464 F.Supp.2d at 499 (citing <i>Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods., Inc.,</i>
73 F.3d 497, 503&#8211;04 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Schieffelin &amp; Co. v. Jack Co.
of Boca, Inc.,</i> 850 F.Supp. 232, 248 (S.D.N.Y.1994)). �An intent to parody
is not an intent to confuse the public.� <i>Jordache,</i> 828 F.2d at 1486.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the district court. It is a matter of
common sense that the strength of a famous mark allows consumers immediately to
perceive the target of the parody, while simultaneously allowing them to
recognize the changes to the mark that make the parody funny or biting. <i>See
Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. v. Nature Labs, LLC,</i> 221 F.Supp.2d 410, 416
(S.D.N.Y.2002) (noting that the strength of the �TOMMY HILFIGER� fashion mark
did not favor the mark's owner in an infringement case against �TIMMY
HOLEDIGGER� novelty pet perfume). In this case, precisely because LOUIS VUITTON
is so strong a mark and so well recognized as a luxury handbag brand from LVM,
consumers readily recognize that when they see a �Chewy Vuiton� pet toy, they
see a parody. Thus, the strength of LVM's marks in this case does not help LVM
establish a likelihood of confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With respect to the second <i>Pizzeria Uno</i>
factor, the similarities between the marks, the usage by Haute Diggity Dog
again converts what might be a problem for Haute Diggity Dog into a disfavored
conclusion for LVM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Haute Diggity Dog concedes that its marks are and
were designed to be somewhat similar to LVM's marks. But that is the essence of
a parody&#8212;the invocation of a famous mark in the consumer's mind, so long
as the distinction between the marks is also readily recognized. While a
trademark parody necessarily copies enough of the original design to bring it
to mind as a target, a successful parody also distinguishes itself and, because
of the implicit message communicated by the parody, allows the consumer to
appreciate it. <i>See PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 366 (citing <i>Jordache,</i> 828
F.2d at 1486); <i>Anheuser&#8211;Busch,</i> 962 F.2d at 321.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In concluding that Haute Diggity Dog has a
successful parody, we have impliedly concluded that Haute Diggity Dog
appropriately mimicked a part of the LVM marks, but at the same time
sufficiently distinguished its own product to communicate the satire. The
differences are sufficiently obvious and the parody sufficiently blatant that a
consumer encountering a �Chewy Vuiton� dog toy would not mistake its source or
sponsorship on the basis of mark similarity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This conclusion is reinforced when we consider how
the parties actually use their marks in the marketplace. <i>See CareFirst,</i>
434 F.3d at 267 (citing <i>What&#8211;A&#8211;Burger of Va., Inc. v.
Whataburger, Inc.,</i> 357 F.3d 441, 450 (4th Cir.2004)); <i>Lamparello v.
Falwell,</i> 420 F.3d 309, 316 (4th Cir.2005); <i>Hormel Foods,</i> 73 F.3d at
503. The record amply supports Haute Diggity Dog's contention that its �Chewy
Vuiton� toys for dogs are generally sold alongside other pet products, as well
as toys that parody other luxury brands, whereas LVM markets its handbags as a
top-end luxury item to be purchased only in its own stores or in its own
boutiques within department stores. These marketing channels further emphasize
that �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys are not, in fact, LOUIS VUITTON products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>C</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nor does LVM find support from the third <i>Pizzeria
Uno</i> factor, the similarity of the products themselves. It is obvious that a
�Chewy Vuiton� plush imitation handbag, which does not open and is manufactured
as a dog toy, is not a LOUIS VUITTON handbag sold by LVM. Even LVM's most
proximate products&#8212;dog collars, leashes, and pet carriers&#8212;are
fashion accessories, not dog toys. As Haute Diggity Dog points out, LVM does
not make pet chew toys and likely does not intend to do so in the future. Even
if LVM were to make dog toys in the future, the fact remains that the products
at issue are not similar in any relevant respect, and this factor does not
favor LVM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>D</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fourth and fifth <i>Pizzeria Uno</i> factors,
relating to the similarity of facilities and advertising channels, have already
been mentioned. LVM products are sold exclusively through its own stores or its
own boutiques within department stores. It also sells its products on the
Internet through an LVM-authorized website. In contrast, �Chewy Vuiton�
products are sold primarily through traditional and Internet pet stores,
although they might also be sold in some department stores. The record
demonstrates that both LVM handbags and �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys are sold at a
Macy's department store in New York. As a general matter, however, there is
little overlap in the individual retail stores selling the brands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Likewise with respect to advertising, there is
little or no overlap. LVM markets LOUIS VUITTON handbags through high-end
fashion magazines, while �Chewy Vuiton� products are advertised primarily
through pet-supply channels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The overlap in facilities and advertising
demonstrated by the record is so minimal as to be practically nonexistent.
�Chewy Vuiton� toys and LOUIS VUITTON products are neither sold nor advertised
in the same way, and the <i>de minimis</i> overlap lends insignificant support
to LVM on this factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>E</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The sixth factor, relating to Haute Diggity Dog's
intent, again is neutralized by the fact that Haute Diggity Dog markets a
parody of LVM products. As other courts have recognized, �An intent to parody
is not an intent to confuse the public.� <i>Jordache,</i> 828 F.2d at 1486.
Despite Haute Diggity Dog's obvious intent to profit from its use of parodies,
this action does not amount to a bad faith intent to create consumer confusion.
To the contrary, the intent is to do just the opposite&#8212;to evoke a
humorous, satirical association that <i>distinguishes</i> the products. This
factor does not favor LVM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>F</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the actual confusion factor, it is well
established that no actual confusion is required to prove a case of trademark
infringement, although the presence of actual confusion can be persuasive
evidence relating to a likelihood of confusion. <i>See CareFirst,</i> 434 F.3d
at 268.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While LVM conceded in the district court that there
was no evidence of actual confusion, on appeal it points to incidents where
retailers misspelled �Chewy Vuiton� on invoices or order forms, using two Ts
instead of one. Many of these invoices also reflect simultaneous orders for
multiple types of Haute Diggity Dog parody products, which belies the notion
that any actual confusion existed as to the source of �Chewy Vuiton� plush toys.
The misspellings pointed out by LVM are far more likely in this context to
indicate confusion over how to spell the product name than any confusion over
the source or sponsorship of the �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys. We conclude that this
factor favors Haute Diggity Dog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, the likelihood-of-confusion factors
substantially favor Haute Diggity Dog. But consideration of these factors is
only a proxy for the ultimate statutory test of whether Haute Diggity Dog's
marketing, sale, and distribution of �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys is likely to cause
confusion. Recognizing that �Chewy Vuiton� is an obvious parody and applying
the <i>Pizzeria Uno</i> factors, we conclude that LVM has failed to demonstrate
any likelihood of confusion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant
of summary judgment in favor of Haute Diggity Dog on the issue of trademark
infringement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> LVM also contends that Haute Diggity Dog's
advertising, sale, and distribution of the �Chewy Vuiton� dog toys dilutes its
LOUIS VUITTON, LV, and Monogram Canvas marks, which are famous and distinctive,
in violation of the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (�TDRA�), 15
U.S.C.A. � 1125(c) (West Supp.2007). It argues, �Before the district court's
decision, Vuitton's famous marks were unblurred by any third party trademark
use.� �Allowing defendants to become the first to use similar marks will
obviously blur and dilute the Vuitton Marks.� It also contends that �Chewy
Vuiton� dog toys are likely to tarnish LVM's marks because they �pose a choking
hazard for some dogs.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Haute Diggity Dog urges that, in applying the TDRA
to the circumstances before us, we reject LVM's suggestion that a parody
�automatically� gives rise to �actionable dilution.� Haute Diggity Dog contends
that only marks that are �identical or substantially similar� can give rise to
actionable dilution, and its �Chewy Vuiton� marks are not identical or
sufficiently similar to LVM's marks. It also argues that �[its] spoof, like
other obvious parodies,� � �tends to increase public identification� of [LVM's]
mark with [LVM],� quoting <i>Jordache,</i> 828 F.2d at 1490, rather than
impairing its distinctiveness, as the TDRA requires. As for LVM's tarnishment
claim, Haute Diggity Dog argues that LVM's position is at best based on
speculation and that LVM has made no showing of a likelihood of dilution by
tarnishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span

to the ability of the famous mark uniquely to identify a single source and thus

293 F.3d 550, 558 (2d Cir.2002) (observing that blurring occurs where the

proving a dilution claim under the TDRA, the plaintiff need not show actual or

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We address first LVM's claim for dilution by
blurring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first three elements of a trademark dilution
claim are not at issue in this case. LVM owns famous marks that are
distinctive; Haute Diggity Dog has commenced using �Chewy Vuiton,� �CV,� and
designs and colors that are allegedly diluting LVM's marks; and the similarity
between Haute Diggity Dog's marks and LVM's marks gives rise to an association
between the marks, albeit a parody. The issue for resolution is whether the
association between Haute Diggity Dog's marks and LVM's marks is likely to
impair the distinctiveness of LVM's famous marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In deciding this issue, the district court
correctly outlined the six factors to be considered in determining whether
dilution by blurring has been shown. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C.A. � 1125(c)(2)(B).
But in evaluating the facts of the case, the court did not directly apply those
factors it enumerated. It held simply:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[The famous mark's] strength is not likely to be blurred by
a parody dog toy product. Instead of blurring Plaintiff's mark, the success of
the parodic use depends upon the continued association with LOUIS VUITTON.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Louis Vuitton Malletier,</i> 464 F.Supp.2d at 505.
The amicus supporting LVM's position in this case contends that the district
court, by not applying the statutory factors, misapplied the TDRA to conclude
that simply because Haute Diggity Dog's product was a parody meant that �there
can be no <i>association</i> with the famous mark as a matter of law.�
Moreover, the amicus points out correctly that to rule in favor of Haute
Diggity Dog, the district court was required to find that the �association� did
not impair the distinctiveness of LVM's famous mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LVM goes further in its own brief, however, and contends:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>When a defendant uses an imitation
of a famous mark in connection with related goods, a claim of parody cannot
preclude liability for dilution.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>* * *</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>The district court's opinion
utterly ignores the substantial goodwill VUITTON has established in its famous
marks through more than a century of <i>exclusive</i> use. Disregarding the
clear Congressional mandate to protect such famous marks against dilution, the
district court has granted [Haute Diggity Dog] permission to become the first
company other than VUITTON to use imitations of the famous VUITTON Marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In short, LVM suggests that any use by a third
person of an imitation of its famous marks dilutes the famous marks as a matter
of law. This contention misconstrues the TDRA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The TDRA prohibits a person from using a junior
mark that is likely to dilute (by blurring) the famous mark, and blurring is
defined to be an impairment to the famous mark's distinctiveness.
�Distinctiveness� in turn refers to the public's recognition that the famous
mark identifies a single source of the product using the famous mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To determine whether a junior mark is likely to
dilute a famous mark through blurring, the TDRA directs the court to consider
all factors relevant to the issue, including six factors that are enumerated in
the statute:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(i) The degree of similarity
between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(ii) The degree of inherent or
acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(iii) The extent to which the
owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the
mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(iv) The degree of recognition of
the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(v) Whether the user of the mark
or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(vi) Any actual association
between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C.A. � 1125(c)(2)(B). Not every factor will be
relevant in every case, and not every blurring claim will require extensive
discussion of the factors. But a trial court must offer a sufficient indication
of which factors it has found persuasive and explain why they are persuasive so
that the court's decision can be reviewed. The district court did not do this
adequately in this case. Nonetheless, after we apply the factors as a matter of
law, we reach the same conclusion reached by the district court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We begin by noting that parody is not automatically
a complete <i>defense</i> to a claim of dilution by blurring where the
defendant uses the parody as its own designation of source, i.e., <i>as a
trademark.</i> Although the TDRA does provide that fair use is a complete
defense and allows that a parody can be considered fair use, it does not extend
the fair use defense to parodies used as a trademark. As the statute provides:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>The following shall not be
actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under this
subsection:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(A) Any fair use ... <i>other than
as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services,</i>
including use in connection with ... parodying....</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C.A. � 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). Under
the statute's plain language, parodying a famous mark is protected by the fair
use defense only if the parody is <i>not</i> �a designation of source for the
person's own goods or services.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The TDRA, however, does not require a court to
ignore the existence of a parody that is used as a trademark, and it does not
preclude a court from considering parody as part of the circumstances to be
considered for determining whether the plaintiff has made out a claim for
dilution by blurring. Indeed, the statute permits a court to consider �all
relevant factors,� including the six factors supplied in � 1125(c)(2)(B).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, it would appear that a defendant's use of a
mark as a parody is relevant to the overall question of whether the defendant's
use is likely to impair the famous mark's distinctiveness. Moreover, the fact
that the defendant uses its marks as a parody is specifically relevant to
several of the listed factors. For example, factor (v) (whether the defendant intended
to create an association with the famous mark) and factor (vi) (whether there
exists an actual association between the defendant's mark and the famous mark)
directly invite inquiries into the defendant's intent in using the parody, the
defendant's actual use of the parody, and the effect that its use has on the
famous mark. While a parody intentionally creates an association with the
famous mark in order to be a parody, it also intentionally communicates, if it
is successful, that it is <i>not</i> the famous mark, but rather a satire of
the famous mark. <i>See PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 366. That the defendant is using
its mark as a parody is therefore relevant in the consideration of these
statutory factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Similarly, factors (i), (ii), and (iv)&#8212;the
degree of similarity between the two marks, the degree of distinctiveness of
the famous mark, and its recognizability&#8212;are directly implicated by
consideration of the fact that the defendant's mark is a successful parody.
Indeed, by making the famous mark an object of the parody, a successful parody
might actually enhance the famous mark's distinctiveness by making it an icon.
The brunt of the joke becomes yet more famous. <i>See Hormel Foods,</i> 73 F.3d
at 506 (observing that a successful parody �tends to increase public
identification� of the famous mark with its source); <i>see also Yankee Publ'g
Inc. v. News Am. Publ'g Inc.,</i> 809 F.Supp. 267, 272&#8211;82 (S.D.N.Y.1992)
(suggesting that a sufficiently obvious parody is unlikely to blur the targeted
famous mark).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>54</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, while a defendant's use of a parody as a
mark does not support a �fair use� defense, it may be considered in determining
whether the plaintiff-owner of a famous mark has proved its claim that the
defendant's use of a parody mark is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the
famous mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the case before us, when considering factors
(ii), (iii), and (iv), it is readily apparent, indeed conceded by Haute Diggity
Dog, that LVM's marks are distinctive, famous, and strong. The LOUIS VUITTON
mark is well known and is commonly identified as a brand of the great Parisian
fashion house, Louis Vuitton Malletier. So too are its other marks and designs,
which are invariably used with the LOUIS VUITTON mark. It may not be too strong
to refer to these famous marks as icons of high fashion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While the establishment of these facts satisfies
essential elements of LVM's dilution claim, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C.A. �
1125(c)(1), the facts impose on LVM an increased burden to demonstrate that the
distinctiveness of its famous marks is likely to be impaired by a successful
parody. Even as Haute Diggity Dog's parody mimics the famous mark, it
communicates simultaneously that it is not the famous mark, but is only
satirizing it. <i>See PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 366. And because the famous mark is
particularly strong and distinctive, it becomes more likely that a parody will
not impair the distinctiveness of the mark. In short, as Haute Diggity Dog's
�Chewy Vuiton� marks are a successful parody, we conclude that they will not
blur the distinctiveness of the famous mark as a unique identifier of its
source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>57</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is important to note, however, that this might
not be true if the parody is so similar to the famous mark that it likely could
be construed as actual use of the famous mark itself. Factor (i) directs an
inquiry into the �degree of similarity between the junior mark and the famous
mark.� If Haute Diggity Dog used the actual marks of LVM (as a parody or
otherwise), it could dilute LVM's marks by blurring, regardless of whether
Haute Diggity Dog's use was confusingly similar, whether it was in competition
with LVM, or whether LVM sustained actual injury. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C.A. �
1125(c)(1). Thus, �the use of DUPONT shoes, BUICK aspirin, and KODAK pianos
would be actionable� under the TDRA because the unauthorized use of the famous
marks <i>themselves</i> on unrelated goods might diminish the capacity of these
trademarks to distinctively identify a single source. <i>Moseley,</i> 537 U.S.
at 431 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 104&#8211;374, at 3 (1995), <i>as reprinted in</i>
1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1030). This is true even though a consumer would be
unlikely to confuse the manufacturer of KODAK film with the hypothetical
producer of KODAK pianos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>58</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But in this case, Haute Diggity Dog mimicked the
famous marks; it did not come so close to them as to destroy the success of its
parody and, more importantly, to diminish the LVM marks' capacity to identify a
single source. Haute Diggity Dog designed a pet chew toy to imitate and
suggest, but not <i>use,</i> the marks of a high-fashion LOUIS VUITTON handbag.
It used �Chewy Vuiton� to mimic �LOUIS VUITTON�; it used �CV� to mimic �LV�;
and it adopted <i>imperfectly</i> the items of LVM's designs. We conclude that
these uses by Haute Diggity Dog were not so similar as to be likely to impair
the distinctiveness of LVM's famous marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>59</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In a similar vein, when considering factors (v) and
(vi), it becomes apparent that Haute Diggity Dog intentionally associated its
marks, but only partially and certainly imperfectly, so as to convey the
simultaneous message that it was not in fact a source of LVM products. Rather,
as a parody, it separated itself from the LVM marks in order to make fun of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>60</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, when considering the relevant factors to
determine whether blurring is likely to occur in this case, we readily come to
the conclusion, as did the district court, that LVM has failed to make out a
case of trademark dilution by blurring by failing to establish that the
distinctiveness of its marks was likely to be impaired by Haute Diggity Dog's
marketing and sale of its �Chewy Vuiton� products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>61</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> LVM's claim for dilution by tarnishment does not
require an extended discussion. To establish its claim for dilution by
tarnishment, LVM must show, in lieu of blurring, that Haute Diggity Dog's use
of the �Chewy Vuiton� mark on dog toys harms the reputation of the LOUIS
VUITTON mark and LVM's other marks. LVM argues that the possibility that a dog
could choke on a �Chewy Vuiton� toy causes this harm. LVM has, however,
provided no record support for its assertion. It relies only on speculation
about whether a dog could choke on the chew toys and a logical concession that
a $10 dog toy made in China was of �inferior quality� to the $1190 LOUIS
VUITTON handbag. The speculation begins with LVM's assertion in its brief that
�defendant Woofie's admitted that �Chewy Vuiton� products pose a choking hazard
for some dogs. Having prejudged the defendant's mark to be a parody, the
district court made light of this admission in its opinion, and utterly failed
to give it the weight it deserved,� citing to a page in the district court's
opinion where the court states:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>At oral argument, plaintiff provided only a flimsy theory
that a pet may some day choke on a Chewy Vuiton squeak toy and incite the wrath
of a confused consumer against LOUIS VUITTON.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Louis Vuitton Malletier,</i> 464 F.Supp.2d at 505.
The court was referring to counsel's statement during oral argument that the
owner of Woofie's stated that �she would not sell this product to certain types
of dogs because there is a danger they would tear it open and choke on it.�
There is no record support, however, that any dog has choked on a pet chew toy,
such as a �Chewy Vuiton� toy, or that there is any basis from which to conclude
that a dog would likely choke on such a toy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>62</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the district court that LVM failed to
demonstrate a claim for dilution by tarnishment. <i>See Hormel Foods,</i> 73

<p class=Blockquote>We believe that in general the [Lanham] Act should be

subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., manufactures and distributes
the Grand Theft Auto series of video games (the �Series�), including Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas (�San Andreas� or the �Game�). The Series is known for
an irreverent and sometimes crass brand of humor, gratuitous violence and sex,
and overall seediness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Each game in the Series takes place in one or more
dystopic, cartoonish cities modeled after actual American urban areas. The
games always include a disclaimer stating that the locations depicted are
fictional. Players control the game's protagonist, trying to complete various
�missions� on a video screen. The plot advances with each mission accomplished
until the player, having passed through thousands of cartoon-style places along
the way, wins the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Consistent with the tone of the Series, San Andreas
allows a player to experience a version of West Coast �gangster� culture. The
Game takes place in the virtual cities of �Los Santos,� �San Fierro,� and �Las
Venturas,� based on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Los Santos, of course, mimics the look and feel of
actual Los Angeles neighborhoods. Instead of �Hollywood,� �Santa Monica,�
�Venice Beach,� and �Compton,� Los Santos contains �Vinewood,� �Santa Maria,�
�Verona Beach,� and �Ganton.� Rockstar has populated these areas with virtual
liquor stores, ammunition dealers, casinos, pawn shops, tattoo parlors, bars,
and strip clubs. The brand names, business names, and other aspects of the
locations have been changed to fit the irreverent �Los Santos� tone. Not
especially saintly, Los Santos is complete with gangs who roam streets
inhabited by prostitutes and drug pushers while random gunfire punctuates the
soundtrack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To generate their vision for Los Santos, some of
the artists who drew it visited Los Angeles to take reference photographs. The
artists took pictures of businesses, streets, and other places in Los Angeles
that they thought evoked the San Andreas theme. They then returned home (to
Scotland) to draw Los Santos, changing the images from the photographs as necessary
to fit into the fictional world of Los Santos and San Andreas. According to
Nikolas Taylor (�Taylor�), the Lead Map Artist for Los Santos, he and other
artists did not seek to �re-creat[e] a realistic depiction of Los Angeles;
rather, [they] were creating �Los Santos,� a fictional city that lampooned the
seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the people, business and places [that]
comprise it.� One neighborhood in the fictional city is �East Los Santos,� the
Game's version of East Los Angeles. East Los Santos contains variations on the
businesses and architecture of the real thing, including a virtual,
cartoon-style strip club known as the �Pig Pen.�</p>

strip club, which features females dancing nude, on the eastern edge of
downtown Los Angeles under the name Play Pen Gentlemen's Club (�Play Pen�). ESS
claims that Rockstar's depiction of an East Los Santos strip club called the
Pig Pen infringes its trademark and trade dress associated with the Play Pen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span

Play Pen� (and the lower-and upper-case letters forming those words) and the
phrase �Totally Nude� displayed in a publicly available font, with a silhouette
of a nude female dancer inside the stem of the first �P.� Apparently, ESS has
no physical master or precise template for its logo. Different artists draw the
nude silhouette in Play Pen's logo anew for each representation, although any
final drawing must be acceptable to Play Pen's owners. There are several
different versions of the silhouette, and some advertisements and signs for the
Play Pen do not contain the nude silhouettes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

their photographs of the Play Pen, it seems they used photographs of other East
Los Angeles locations to design other aspects of 15148 the Pig Pen. The Pig Pen
building in Los Santos, for instance, lacks certain characteristics of the Play
Pen building such as a stone facade, a valet stand, large plants and gold
columns around the entrance, and a six-foot black iron fence around the parking
lot. The Play Pen also has a red, white, and blue pole sign near the premises,
which includes a trio of nude silhouettes above the logo and a separate
�Totally Nude� sign below. The Pig Pen does not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On April 22, 2005, ESS filed the underlying
trademark violation action in district court against Rockstar. ESS asserted
four claims: (1) trade dress infringement and unfair competition under section
43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a);<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[30]</span></span></span></a>
(2) trademark infringement under California Business and Professions Code �

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[31]</span></span></span></a>
(3) unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code �� 17200
et seq.; and (4) unfair competition under California common law. The heart of
ESS's complaint is that Rockstar has used Play Pen's distinctive logo and trade
dress without its authorization and has created a likelihood of confusion among
consumers as to whether ESS has endorsed, or is associated with, the video
depiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In response, Rockstar moved for summary judgment on
all of ESS's claims, arguing that the affirmative defenses of nominative fair
use and the First Amendment protected it against liability. It also argued that
its use of ESS's intellectual property did not infringe ESS's trademark by
creating a �likelihood of confusion.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the district court rejected Rockstar's
nominative fair use defense, it granted summary judgment based on the First
Amendment defense. The district court did not address the merits of the
trademark claim because its finding that Rockstar had a defense against
liability made such analysis unnecessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Rockstar argues that, regardless of whether it
infringed ESS's trademark under the Lanham Act or related California law, it is
entitled to two defenses: one under the nominative fair use doctrine and one
under the First Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �Unlike a traditional fair use scenario,
[nominative fair use occurs when] the defendant ... us[es] the trademarked term
to describe not its own product, but the plaintiff's.� <i>Playboy Enters., Inc.
v. Welles,</i> 279 F.3d 796, 801 (9th Cir.2002). The doctrine protects those
who deliberately use another's trademark or trade dress �for the �purposes of
comparison, criticism [,] or point of reference.� � <i>Walking Mountain,</i>
353 F.3d at 809 (alteration omitted) (quoting <i>New Kids on the Block v. News
Am. Publ'g, Inc.,</i> 971 F.2d 302, 306 (9th Cir.1992)). In this case, however,
Rockstar's use of �Pig Pen� is not �identical to the plaintiff's [Play Pen]
mark.� Furthermore, the district court observed that Rockstar's Lead Map Artist
�testified the goal in designing the Pig Pen was ... not to comment on Play Pen
<i>per se.</i>� Since Rockstar did not use the trademarked logo to describe
ESS's strip club, the district court correctly held that the nominative fair
use defense does not apply in this case. <i>See Welles,</i> 279 F.3d at 801.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Rockstar's second defense asks us to consider the
intersection of trademark law and the First Amendment. The road is well
traveled. We have adopted the Second Circuit's approach from <i>Rogers v.
Grimaldi,</i> which �requires courts to construe the Lanham Act �to apply to
artistic works <i>only</i> where the public interest in avoiding consumer
confusion <i>outweighs</i> the public interest in free expression.� � <i>Walking
Mountain,</i> 353 F.3d at 807 (emphasis in original) (quoting <i>Rogers v.
Grimaldi,</i> 875 F.2d 994, 999 (2d Cir.1989)). The specific test contains two
prongs. An artistic work's use of a trademark that otherwise would violate the
Lanham Act is not actionable � �unless the [use of the mark] has no artistic
relevance to the underlying work whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic
relevance, unless [it] explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of
the work.� � <i>Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.,</i> 296 F.3d 894, 902 (9th
Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Rogers,</i> 875 F.2d at 999). Although this test
traditionally applies to uses of a trademark in the title of an artistic work,
there is no principled reason why it ought not also apply to the use of a
trademark in the body of the work. <i>See Walking Mountain,</i> 353 F.3d at 809
n. 17 (implying that it would be acceptable to apply the <i>Rogers</i> test to
non-titular trade dress claim). The parties do not dispute such an extension of
the doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We first adopted the <i>Rogers</i> test in <i>MCA
Records,</i> a case which is instructive for that reason. <i>MCA Records,</i>
296 F.3d at 902 (�We agree with the Second Circuit's analysis and adopt the <i>Rogers</i>
standard as our own.�). In <i>MCA Records,</i> the maker of the iconic �Barbie�
dolls sued MCA for trademark infringement in the title of a song the record
company had released, called �Barbie Girl.� <i>Id.</i> at 899-900. The song was
a commentary �about Barbie and the values ... she [supposedly] represents.� <i>Id.</i>
at 902. Applying <i>Rogers,</i> the court held that the First Amendment
protected the record company. The first prong was straightforward. Because the
song was about Barbie, �the use of Barbie in the song title clearly is relevant
to the underlying work.� <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also Walking Mountain,</i> 353 F.3d
at 807 (holding that use of Barbie doll in photographic parody was relevant to
the underlying work).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moving to the second prong, we made an important
point. �The <i>only</i> indication,� we observed, �that Mattel might be
associated with the song is the use of Barbie in the title; if this were enough
to satisfy this prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test, it would render <i>Rogers</i>
a nullity.� <i>MCA Records,</i> 296 F.3d at 902 (emphasis in original). This
makes good sense. After all, a trademark infringement claim presupposes a use
of the mark. If that necessary element in every trademark case vitiated a First
Amendment defense, the First Amendment would provide no defense at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Keeping <i>MCA Records</i> and related cases in
mind, we now turn to the matter before us. ESS concedes that the Game is
artistic and that therefore the <i>Rogers</i> test applies. However, ESS argues
both that the incorporation of the Pig Pen into the Game has no artistic
relevance and that it is explicitly misleading. It rests its argument on two
observations: (1) the Game is not �about� ESS's Play Pen club the way that
�Barbie Girl� was �about� the Barbie doll in <i>MCA Records</i>; and (2) also
unlike the Barbie case, where the trademark and trade dress at issue was a
cultural icon (Barbie), the Play Pen is not a cultural icon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ESS's objections, though factually accurate, miss
the point. Under <i>MCA Records</i> and the cases that followed it, only the
use of a trademark with � �<i>no</i> artistic relevance to the underlying work <i>whatsoever</i>
� � does not merit First Amendment protection. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added)
(quoting <i>Rogers,</i> 875 F.2d at 999). In other words, the level of
relevance merely must be above zero. It is true that the Game is not �about�
the Play Pen the way that Barbie Girl was about Barbie. But, given the low
threshold the Game must surmount, that fact is hardly dispositive. It is also
true that Play Pen has little cultural significance, but the same could be said
about most of the individual establishments in East Los Angeles. Like most
urban neighborhoods, its distinctiveness lies in its �look and feel,� not in
particular destinations as in a downtown or tourist district. And that
neighborhood, with all that characterizes it, <i>is</i> relevant to Rockstar's
artistic goal, which is to develop a cartoon-style parody of East Los Angeles.
Possibly the only way, and certainly a reasonable way, to do that is to
recreate a critical mass of the businesses and buildings that constitute it. In
this context, we conclude that to include a strip club that is similar in look
and feel to the Play Pen does indeed have at least �some artistic relevance.� <i>See
id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ESS also argues that Rockstar's use of the Pig Pen
� �explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.� � <i>Id.</i>
(quoting <i>Rogers,</i> 875 F.2d at 999). This prong of the test points
directly at the purpose of trademark law, namely to �avoid confusion in the
marketplace by allowing a trademark owner to prevent others from duping
consumers into buying a product they mistakenly believe is sponsored by the
trademark owner.� <i>Walking Mountain,</i> 353 F.3d at 806 (internal quotation
marks and alteration omitted). The relevant question, therefore, is whether the
Game would confuse its players into thinking that the Play Pen is somehow
behind the Pig Pen or that it sponsors Rockstar's product. In answering that
question, we keep in mind our observation in <i>MCA Records</i> that the mere
use of a trademark alone cannot suffice to make such use explicitly misleading.
<i>See MCA Records,</i> 296 F.3d at 902.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both San Andreas and the Play Pen offer a form of
low-brow entertainment; besides this general similarity, they have nothing in
common. The San Andreas Game is not complementary to the Play Pen; video games
and strip clubs do not go together like a horse and carriage or, perish the
thought, love and marriage. Nothing indicates that the buying public would
reasonably have believed that ESS produced the video game or, for that matter,
that Rockstar operated a strip club. A player can enter the virtual strip club
in Los Santos, but ESS has provided no evidence that the setting is anything
but generic. It also seems far-fetched that someone playing San Andreas would
think ESS had provided whatever expertise, support, or unique strip-club knowledge
it possesses to the production of the game. After all, the Game does not
revolve around running or patronizing a strip club. Whatever one can do at the
Pig Pen seems quite incidental to the overall story of the Game. A reasonable
consumer would not think a company that owns one strip club in East Los
Angeles, which is not well known to the public at large, also produces a
technologically sophisticated video game like San Andreas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Undeterred, ESS also argues that, because players
are free to ignore the storyline and spend as much time as they want at the Pig
Pen, the Pig Pen can be considered a significant part of the Game, leading to
confusion. But fans can spend all nine innings of a baseball game at the hot
dog stand; that hardly makes Dodger Stadium a butcher's shop. In other words,
the chance to attend a virtual strip club is unambiguously <i>not</i> the main
selling point of the Game.</p>

<p class=Centered>III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Considering all of the foregoing, we conclude that
Rockstar's modification of ESS's trademark is not explicitly misleading and is
thus protected by the First Amendment. Since the First Amendment defense
applies equally to ESS's state law claims as to its Lanham Act claim, the
district court properly dismissed the entire case on Rockstar's motion for
summary judgment.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1). Although claims under � 43(a)
generally relate to the use of trademarks or trade dress to cause consumer

being free from consumer confusion about affiliations and endorsements, but
this protection is limited by the First Amendment, particularly if the product
involved is an expressive work. Recognizing the need to balance the public's
First Amendment interest in free expression against the public's interest in
being free from consumer confusion about affiliation and endorsement, the
Second Circuit created the �<i>Rogers</i> test� in <i>Rogers v. Grimaldi,</i>
875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir.1989). Under the <i>Rogers</i> test, � 43(a) will not be
applied to expressive works �unless the [use of the trademark or other identifying

it has some artistic relevance, unless the [use of trademark or other

in this case granted EA's motion to dismiss Brown's Lanham Act claim, finding
that Brown had not alleged facts that satisfied either condition that allow a �
43(a) claim to succeed under the <i>Rogers</i> test. <i>Brown v. Elec. Arts,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Jim Brown is widely regarded as one of the best
professional football players of all time. He starred for the Cleveland Browns
from 1957 to 1965 and was inducted into the National Football League (�NFL�)
Hall of Fame after his retirement. After his NFL career, Brown also achieved
success as an entertainer and public servant. There is no question that he is a
public figure whose persona can be deployed for economic benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> EA is a manufacturer, distributor and seller of
video games and has produced the <i>Madden NFL</i> series of football video
games since 1989. The <i>Madden NFL</i> series allows users of the games to
control avatars representing professional football players as those avatars
participate in simulated NFL games. In addition to these simulated games, <i>Madden
NFL</i> also enables users to participate in other aspects of a simulated NFL
by, for example, creating and managing a franchise. Each version of <i>Madden
NFL</i> includes the current year's NFL teams with the teams' current rosters.
Each avatar on a current team is designed to mirror a real current NFL player,
including the player's name, jersey number, physical attributes, and physical
skills. Some versions of the game also include historical and all-time teams.
Unlike for players on the current NFL teams, no names are used for the players
on the historical and all-time teams, but these players are recognizable due to
the accuracy of their team affiliations, playing positions, ages, heights,
weights, ability levels, and other attributes. Although EA enters into
licensing agreements with the NFL and NFL Players Association (�NFLPA�) for its
use of the names and likenesses of current NFL players, Brown, as a former
player, is not covered by those agreements and has never entered into any other
agreement allowing EA to use his likeness in <i>Madden NFL.</i> Brown asserts
that EA has used his likeness in several versions of the game dating back at
least to 2001 but that he has never been compensated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span

Court for the Central District of California, claiming that EA's use of his
likeness in the <i>Madden NFL</i> games violated � 43(a) of the Lanham Act.
Brown also brought claims under California law for invasion of privacy and
unfair and unlawful business practices. EA filed a motion to dismiss pursuant
to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the district
court applied the <i>Rogers</i> test and dismissed Brown's Lanham Act claim. <i>Brown,</i>

state-law claims. <i>Id.</i> at *5&#8211;6, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131387, at

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The legal issues raised by this case are not novel,
but their lack of novelty should not be mistaken for lack of difficulty.
Significant judicial resources, including the resources of this court, have
been expended trying to find the appropriate balance between trademark and
similar rights, on the one hand, and First Amendment rights, on the other.
Brown suggests that the case law has produced a lack of clarity as to the
appropriate legal framework to apply in this case and urges us to consider the
�likelihood of confusion� test and the �alternative means� test in addition to
the <i>Rogers</i> test. We are convinced that the <i>Rogers</i> test remains
the appropriate framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A decade ago, in <i>Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records,
Inc.,</i> we adopted the <i>Rogers</i> test as our method for balancing the
trademark and similar rights protected by � 43(a) of the Lanham Act against
First Amendment rights in cases involving expressive works. <i>MCA,</i> 296
F.3d at 902. Although <i>MCA</i> concerned the use of a trademark in the title
of an expressive work, and the language of the <i>MCA</i> opinion did not make
it clear that we were adopting the <i>Rogers</i> test for cases where the
trademark or other identifying material in question was used in the body of a
work rather than in the title, we clarified in <i>E.S.S. Entertainment 2000,
Inc. v. Rock Star Videos, Inc.</i> that application of the <i>Rogers</i> test
was not dependent on the identifying material appearing in the title but �also
appl[ies] to the use of a trademark in the body of the work.� 547 F.3d 1095,
1099 (9th Cir.2008). We have consistently employed the <i>Rogers</i> test in �
43(a) cases involving expressive works since <i>MCA,</i> including where the
trademark or other identifying material in question was used in the body of a
work rather than in the title. <i>See, e.g., id.; Mattel, Inc. v. Walking
Mountain Prods.,</i> 353 F.3d 792 (9th Cir.2003).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Rogers</i> test is reserved for expressive
works. Even if <i>Madden NFL</i> is not the expressive equal of <i>Anna
Karenina</i> or <i>Citizen Kane,</i> the Supreme Court has answered with an
emphatic �yes� when faced with the question of whether video games deserve the
same protection as more traditional forms of expression. In <i>Brown v.
Entertainment Merchants Ass'n,</i> the Court said that �[l]ike the protected
books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate
ideas&#8212;and even social messages&#8212;through many familiar literary
devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features
distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual
world)� and that these similarities to other expressive mediums �suffice[ ] to
confer First Amendment protection.� &#8211;&#8211;&#8211; U.S.
&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 2733 (2011). Although there may
be some work referred to as a �video game� (or referred to as a �book,� �play,�
or �movie� for that matter) that does not contain enough of the elements contemplated
by the Supreme Court to warrant First Amendment protection as an expressive
work, no version of <i>Madden NFL</i> is such a work. Every version of the game
features characters (players), dialogue (between announcers), plot (both within
a particular simulated game and more broadly), and music. Interaction between
the virtual world of the game and individuals playing the game is prevalent.
Even if there is a line to be drawn between expressive video games and
non-expressive video games, and even if courts should at some point be drawing
that line, we have no need to draw that line here.<a href="#_ftn34"

font-family:Cambria'>[34]</span></span></span></a> Each version of <i>Madden
NFL</i> is an expressive work, and our precedents dictate that we apply the <i>Rogers</i>
test in � 43(a) cases involving expressive works. Brown acknowledges that <i>Rogers</i>
may apply here, but he argues that the �likelihood of confusion� test,
exemplified by <i>Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.,</i>
109 F.3d 1394 (9th Cir.1997), or the �alternative means� test, exemplified by <i>International
Olympic Committee v. San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics,</i> 781 F.2d 733 (9th
Cir.1986), <i>reh'g en banc denied,</i> 789 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir.1986), <i>aff'd
on other grounds, S.F. Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Comm.,</i>
483 U.S. 522, 107 S.Ct. 2971, 97 L.Ed.2d 427 (1987), are also relevant. We
disagree. We have previously rejected the �likelihood of confusion� test as
�fail[ing] to account for the full weight of the public's interest in free
expression� when expressive works are involved. <i>MCA,</i> 296 F.3d at 900.
The �alternative means� test was rejected for the same reason in <i>Rogers</i>
itself, 875 F.2d at 999, a position we approved by adopting the <i>Rogers</i>
test in <i>MCA.</i> The only relevant legal framework for balancing the
public's right to be free from consumer confusion about Brown's affiliation
with <i>Madden NFL</i> and EA's First Amendment rights in the context of
Brown's � 43(a) claim is the <i>Rogers</i> test.</p>

F.2d at 996&#8211;97. Among Rogers' claims was that the use of her name in the
title of the movie violated � 43(a) by creating the false impression that she
was involved with the film. <i>Id.</i> at 997. Recognizing that enforcing �
43(a) in this context might constrain free expression in violation of the First
Amendment, the Second Circuit asserted that the Lanham Act should be �appl[ied]
to artistic works only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion
outweighs the public interest in free expression.� <i>Id.</i> at 999. The <i>Rogers</i>
court introduced a two-pronged test, under which the Lanham Act should not be
applied to expressive works �unless the [use of the trademark or other
identifying material] has no artistic relevance to the underlying work
whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the [trademark or
other identifying material] explicitly misleads as to the source or the content
of the work.� <i>Id.</i></p>

similar facts to Brown's case in which we applied the <i>Rogers</i> test to a �
43(a) claim related to the use of the likeness of a Los Angeles strip club in
the video game <i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,</i> �the level of [artistic]
relevance [of the trademark or other identifying material to the work] merely
must be above zero� for the trademark or other identifying material to be
deemed artistically relevant. 547 F.3d at 1100. This black-and-white rule has
the benefit of limiting our need to engage in artistic analysis in this
context.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the district court that the use of
Brown's likeness is artistically relevant to the <i>Madden NFL</i> games. As
Brown points out in trying to undermine the status of the games as expressive
works, EA prides itself on the extreme realism of the games. As Brown
emphasizes in arguing that it is in fact his likeness in the games: �[I]t is
axiomatic the '65 Cleveland Browns simply, by definition, cannot be the '65
Cleveland Browns without the players who played for the '65 Cleveland Browns.
This fundamental truth applies especially to that team's most famous player,
Jim Brown.� Given the acknowledged centrality of realism to EA's expressive
goal, and the importance of including Brown's likeness to realistically
recreate one of the teams in the game, it is obvious that Brown's likeness has
at least some artistic relevance to EA's work. The fact that any given version
of <i>Madden NFL</i> includes likenesses of thousands of different current and
former NFL players does not impact this analysis. In E.S.S., the virtual strip
club in question was just one of many virtual structures included by the
designers of <i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> in an attempt to simulate the
feel of East Los Angeles, but we nonetheless concluded that the strip club was
artistically relevant to the work. 547 F.3d at 1100. There is no significant
distinction to be made here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Brown questions the artistic relevance of his
likeness to <i>Madden NFL</i> in part by pointing us to the Sixth Circuit's
decision in <i>Parks v. LaFace Records,</i> 329 F.3d 437 (6th Cir.2003). In <i>Parks,</i>
civil rights hero Rosa Parks sued the musical duo Outkast under � 43(a) after
Outkast released a song called <i>Rosa Parks.</i> <i>Id.</i> at 441. Partially
due to the fact that one of the members of Outkast had said that the song was
not �intended ... to be about Rosa Parks or the civil rights movement,� the
Sixth Circuit concluded that the district court should have at least considered
additional evidence before deciding that the use of Ms. Parks' name was
artistically relevant to the song. <i>Id.</i> at 452&#8211;53. Brown alleges
that EA has made similar denials of Jim Brown's relevance to <i>Madden NFL,</i>
and thus argues that Brown's likeness is not artistically relevant to the <i>Madden
NFL</i> games. The court in <i>Parks,</i> however, did not rely solely on the
band's denial that the song was about Ms. Parks or the civil rights movement in
concluding that there was a factual dispute about artistic relevance. �The
composers did <i>not</i> intend [the song] to be about Rosa Parks, and the
lyrics are <i>not</i> about Rosa Parks,� the court stated, emphasizing both
Outkast's denials and the court's own determination that the song's lyrics were
unrelated to Ms. Parks or the civil rights movement. <i>Id.</i> at 452. Here,
even if EA's denials regarding Brown are equivalent to Outkast's denial
regarding Parks, the content of the <i>MaddenNFL</i> games&#8212;the simulation
of NFL football&#8212;is clearly related to Jim Brown, one of the NFL's
all-time greatest players. Moreover, EA's denials are not equivalent to
Outkast's denial. EA has denied using the aspects of Brown's likeness that may
be protected by the Lanham Act and certain state laws, but such denials are a
far cry from Outkast's outright denial of relevance. In letters to Brown's
attorneys, EA officials have claimed that �Brown has not appeared in any <i>Madden
NFL</i> game since 1998,� and that �Brown's name and likeness does not appear
in <i>Madden NFL 08</i> or any packaging or marketing materials associated with
the product.� EA has not denied that Brown's likeness is relevant to <i>Madden
NFL;</i> rather, it has denied that Brown has appeared in the <i>Madden NFL</i>
games released since 1998. If the denials are true&#8212;that is, if Brown's
likeness does not in fact appear in the games&#8212;Brown has no claim at all
under the Lanham Act. We do not understand this to be Brown's position.
Outkast's denial did not similarly undermine Ms. Parks' Lanham Act claim
because Outkast was not denying the use of Parks' name. In order to have a
valid � 43(a) claim based on artistic irrelevance, Brown needs to show both
that his likeness was used and that his likeness was artistically irrelevant to
the <i>Madden NFL</i> games. If artistic irrelevance can only be proven by
accepting the truth of EA's denial of the use of Brown's likeness, Brown cannot
possibly satisfy both of these burdens. Moreover, in the context of a motion to
dismiss, we accept Brown's factual allegations as true, and Brown alleges that
his likeness was used. We must thus assume that EA's denials are false, meaning
they provide no support for artistic irrelevance.<a href="#_ftn36"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> One of the Sixth Circuit's animating concerns in <i>Parks</i>
was that a celebrity's name could be �appropriated solely because of the vastly
increased marketing power of a product bearing the name of [the celebrity].�
329 F.3d at 454. This is a legitimate concern, but the facts in <i>Parks</i>&#8212;specifically,
the court's determination that the lyrics of Outkast's song may very well have
nothing to do with Rosa Parks or the civil rights movement&#8212;made that
concern much more realistic in that case than in this one. EA did not produce a
game called <i>Jim Brown Presents Pinball</i> with no relation to Jim Brown or
football beyond the title; it produced a football game featuring likenesses of
thousands of current and former NFL players, including Brown. Comparing this
case to <i>Parks</i> does not further Brown's cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Brown also asserts that our interpretation of the <i>Rogers</i>
test in <i>E.S.S.</i> to require artistic relevance to �merely ... be above
zero,� 547 F.3d at 1100, has rendered the <i>Rogers</i> test&#8212;described in
the <i>Rogers</i> opinion itself as seeking to strike a �balance� between �the
public's interest in free expression� and �protect[ing] the public against
flagrant deception,� 875 F.2d at 999&#8212;an inflexible and mechanical rule
that more or less automatically protects expressive works regardless of the
deception involved. But a balance need not be designed to find each of the sides
weightier with equal frequency. The language in <i>Rogers</i> is clear. �[T]hat
balance will normally not support application of the [Lanham] Act unless the
[use of the trademark or other identifying material] has <i>no artistic
relevance to the underlying work whatsoever</i>....� 875 F.2d at 999 (emphasis
added). The <i>Rogers</i> test is applicable when First Amendment rights are at
their height&#8212;when expressive works are involved&#8212;so it is no
surprise that the test puts such emphasis on even the slightest artistic
relevance. �Intellectual property rights aren't free: They're imposed at the
expense of future creators and of the public at large,� <i>White v. Samsung
Elecs. Am., Inc.,</i> 989 F.2d 1512, 1516 (9th Cir.1993) (Kozinski, J.,
dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), and the <i>Rogers</i> test
applies when this expense is most significant. Our interpretation of the
�artistic relevance� prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test in <i>E.S.S.</i> is
correct, and Brown fails to allege facts that satisfy that prong in this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if the use of a trademark or other identifying
material is artistically relevant to the expressive work, the creator of the
expressive work can be subject to a Lanham Act claim if the creator uses the
mark or material to �explicitly mislead[ ] [consumers] as to the source or the
content of the work.� <i>Rogers,</i> 875 F.2d at 999. It is key here that the
creator must <i>explicitly</i> mislead consumers. �[T]he slight risk that ...
use of a celebrity's name might implicitly suggest endorsement or sponsorship
to some people is outweighed by the danger of restricting artistic expression,
and [in cases where there is no explicit misleading] the Lanham Act is not
applicable.� <i>Id.</i> at 999&#8211;1000. This second prong of the <i>Rogers</i>
test �points directly at the purpose of trademark law, namely to avoid
confusion in the marketplace by allowing a trademark owner to prevent others
from duping consumers into buying a product they mistakenly believe is
sponsored by the trademark owner.� <i>E.S. S.,</i> 547 F.3d at 1100 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). We must ask �whether the [use of Brown's
likeness] would confuse [<i>Madden NFL</i> ] players into thinking that [Brown]
is somehow behind [the games] or that [he] sponsors [EA's] product,� <i>id.,</i>
and whether there was an �explicit indication,� �overt claim,� or �explicit
misstatement� that caused such consumer confusion, <i>Rogers,</i> 875 F.2d at
1001. Brown puts forth several arguments attempting to show that this second
prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test is satisfied, but each of his arguments is
unsuccessful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, Brown argues that the use of his likeness in
the game coupled with a consumer survey demonstrating that a majority of the
public believes that identifying marks cannot be included in products without
permission at least raises a triable issue of fact as to the second prong of
the <i>Rogers</i> test. It is well established that the use of a mark alone is
not enough to satisfy this prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test. In <i>MCA,</i> we
noted that if the use of a mark alone were sufficient �it would render <i>Rogers</i>
a nullity.� 296 F.3d at 902. We reiterated this point in <i>E.S.S.,</i>
asserting that �the mere use of a trademark alone cannot suffice to make such
use explicitly misleading.� 547 F.3d at 1100. Adding survey evidence changes
nothing. The test requires<b> </b>that the use be <i>explicitly</i> misleading
to consumers. To be relevant, evidence must relate to the nature of the
behavior of the identifying material's user, not the impact of the use. Even if
Brown could offer a survey demonstrating that consumers of the <i>Madden NFL</i>
series believed that Brown endorsed the game, that would not support the claim
that the use was explicitly misleading to consumers. The Sixth Circuit's
decision in <i>ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing, Inc.,</i> 332 F.3d 915 (6th
Cir.2003), demonstrates this point. In that case, Tiger Woods' licensing agent,
ETW Corporation, brought a Lanham Act claim against the publisher of artwork
commemorating Woods' 1997 victory at The Masters. <i>Id.</i> at 918. A survey
was produced in which participants were shown the artwork and asked if they
thought Tiger Woods was affiliated or connected with the work or had approved
or sponsored it. <i>Id.</i> at 937 &amp; n. 19. Over sixty percent of the
participants answered affirmatively, but the Sixth Circuit asserted:
�[P]laintiff's survey evidence, even if its validity is assumed, indicates at
most that some members of the public would draw the incorrect inference that
Woods had some connection with [the work]. The risk of misunderstanding, not
engendered by any explicit indication on the face of the [work], is so
outweighed by the interest in artistic expression as to preclude application of
the [Lanham] Act.� <i>Id.</i> at 937 (footnote omitted). In <i>Rogers</i>
itself, the Second Circuit rejected similar survey data for the same reasons.
875 F.2d at 1001. The use of Brown's likeness together with the cited survey do
not provide a valid argument to allow Brown's case to go forward based on this
prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, Brown argues that certain written materials
that accompanied versions of the game demonstrate EA's attempts to explicitly
mislead consumers about his endorsement or involvement with the game's
production. Unlike mere use of the mark or a consumer survey, statements made
in materials accompanying the game are at least the right kind of evidence to
show that EA tried to explicitly mislead consumers about its relationship with
Brown. Here, however, the statements highlighted by Brown do not show any
attempt to mislead consumers. Brown points to materials that say that one of
the game's features was the inclusion of �[f]ifty of the NFL's greatest players
and every All&#8211;Madden team.� Since Brown is one of the fifty greatest NFL
players of all time and has been named to the �All Madden, All Millennium�
team, Brown argues that the statement �explicitly represents that Brown was in
EA's game.� But Brown needs to prove that EA explicitly misled consumers about
Brown's endorsement of the game, not that EA used Brown's likeness in the game;
nothing in EA's promotion suggests that the fifty NFL players who are members
of the All Madden, All Millennium team endorse EA's game. EA's statement is
true and not misleading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Third, Brown argues that the changes made to
Brown's likeness for use in certain versions of the game satisfy the second
prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test. EA made changes to certain versions of the
game that might make a consumer of the game less confident that the player in
question was intended to be Brown. Most notably, EA changed the jersey number
on the Brown avatar from 32 (the number Brown wore in the NFL) to 37. If these
changes had any impact on whether consumers believed that Brown endorsed the
game, however, surely they made consumers <i>less</i> likely to believe that
Brown was involved. Brown offers various theories about EA's legal motives in
�scrambling� his likeness for use in the game. It may be true that EA was
trying to protect itself from being sued for using Brown's likeness, under the
Lanham Act or otherwise, but an action that could only make consumers less
likely to believe that Brown endorsed <i>Madden NFL</i> cannot possibly satisfy
the second prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fourth, Brown cites various comments made by EA
officials as evidence that the second prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test is
satisfied. As previously discussed, EA attorneys sent letters to Brown's
attorneys stating that �Brown has not appeared in any <i>Madden NFL</i> game
since 1998� and that �Brown's name and likeness does not appear in <i>Madden
NFL 08</i> or any packaging or marketing materials associated with the
product.� Brown claims that EA officials contradicted these statements when
they allegedly said at a conference held at USC Law School that EA was able to
use the images and likenesses of players because it obtained written
authorization from both the NFL players and the NFL. The statements made in
letters to Brown's attorneys are irrelevant to this prong of the <i>Rogers</i>
analysis. They were not made to consumers, and they do not say anything about
Brown's endorsement of the game. The statement allegedly made at the conference
is perhaps the closest Brown comes to offering evidence that EA acted in an
explicitly misleading manner as to Brown's endorsement of the game, but again,
the statement was made to a limited audience, not to consumers. If a similar
statement appeared on the back cover of a version of <i>Madden NFL,</i> that
might satisfy the �explicitly misleading� prong, or at least raise a triable
issue of fact, but a statement made at an academic conference about all of the
likenesses used in the game could not realistically be expected to confuse
consumers as to Brown's involvement.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[37]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>IV</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Brown also argues that the district court
improperly engaged in factfinding in granting EA's motion to dismiss. The
district court, in Brown's view, could not possibly have granted the motion to
dismiss if it accepted all of the allegations in Brown's complaint as true, as
Brown alleges in his complaint that his likeness is not artistically relevant
to <i>Madden NFL</i> and that EA attempted to mislead consumers about his
involvement with <i>Madden NFL.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Brown is of course correct that �[o]n a motion to
dismiss, the court presumes that the facts alleged by the plaintiff are true.� <i>Halet
v. Wend Inv. Co.,</i> 672 F.2d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1982). We will also �draw[ ]
all reasonable inferences from the complaint in [Brown's] favor.� <i>Mohamed v.
Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.,</i> 614 F.3d 1070, 1073 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc)
(internal quotation marks omitted). We are not, however, required to �accept
any unreasonable inferences or assume the truth of legal conclusions cast in
the form of factual allegations.� <i>Ileto v. Glock Inc.,</i> 349 F.3d 1191,
1200 (9th Cir.2003). Brown asserts that there is no artistic relevance and that
EA attempted to mislead consumers about Brown's involvement with <i>Madden NFL,</i>
but none of the facts asserted in support of these legal conclusions actually
justify the conclusions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to artistic relevance, even presuming
that EA officials have denied the inclusion of Brown's likeness in the game,
the district court could conclude, having reviewed the versions of <i>Madden
NFL</i> provided to the court,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[38]</span></span></span></a>
that the likeness of a great NFL player is artistically relevant to a video
game that aims to recreate NFL games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to Brown's allegation that EA
explicitly misled consumers as to his involvement with the game, the factual
support Brown offers is simply of the wrong type. Brown would need to
demonstrate that EA <i>explicitly</i> misled <i>consumers</i> as to his <i>involvement.</i>
Instead, his allegations, if taken as true, only demonstrate that (1) the
public can generally be misled about sponsorship when marks are included in
products; (2) EA explicitly stated that Brown's likeness appears in <i>Madden
NFL;</i> (3) EA tried to disguise its use of Brown's likeness, if anything
making consumers less likely to believe that he was involved; (4) EA was
dishonest with Brown's attorney about the inclusion of his likeness in the
game; and (5) EA suggested to a group of individuals at an academic conference
that the players whose likenesses were used in <i>Madden NFL</i> had signed
licensing agreements with EA. There is simply no allegation that EA explicitly
misled consumers as to Brown's involvement, and thus no problem with the
district court deciding this issue in response to a motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>V</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As expressive works, the <i>Madden NFL</i> video
games are entitled to the same First Amendment protection as great literature,
plays, or books. Brown's Lanham Act claim is thus subject to the <i>Rogers</i>
test, and we agree with the district court that Brown has failed to allege
sufficient facts to make out a plausible claim that survives that test. Brown's
likeness is artistically relevant to the games and there are no alleged facts
to support the claim that EA explicitly misled consumers as to Brown's involvement
with the games. The <i>Rogers</i> test tells us that, in this case, the public
interest in free expression outweighs the public interest in avoiding consumer
confusion. The district court's judgment is thus <span>AFFIRMED<b>.</b></span></p>

<p class=Blockquote>Come on Barbie, let's go party!</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Mattel, Inc., the manufacturers of the Barbie doll,
sued for trademark infringement, including trademark blurring and tarnishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court�s grant of
summary judgment to the defendant.&nbsp; On the issue of consumer confusion,
Judge Kozinski declined to apply the Ninth Circuit�s traditional <i>Sleekcraft</i>
multifactor test for consumer confusion.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Our likelihood-of-confusion test, <i>see AMF Inc. v.
Sleekcraft Boats</i>, 599 F.2d 341, 348&#8211;49 (9th Cir.1979), generally
strikes a comfortable balance between the trademark owner's property rights and
the public's expressive interests. But when a trademark owner asserts a right to
control how we express ourselves&#8212;when we'd find it difficult to describe
the product any other way (as in the case of aspirin), or when the mark (like
Rolls Royce) has taken on an expressive meaning apart from its
source-identifying function&#8212;applying the traditional test fails to
account for the full weight of the public's interest in free expression.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Mattel v. MCA</i>, at 901.&nbsp; Instead, Judge
Kozinski applied the <i>Rogers v. Grimaldi</i> test:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Applying <i>Rogers</i> to our case, we conclude that MCA's
use of Barbie is not an infringement of Mattel's trademark. Under the first
prong of <i>Rogers</i>, the use of Barbie in the song title clearly is relevant
to the underlying work, namely, the song itself. As noted, the song is about
Barbie and the values Aqua claims she represents. The song title does not
explicitly mislead as to the source of the work; it does not, explicitly or
otherwise, suggest that it was produced by Mattel. The only indication that
Mattel might be associated with the song is the use of Barbie in the title; if
this were enough to satisfy this prong of the <i>Rogers</i> test, it would
render <i>Rogers</i> a nullity. We therefore agree with the district court that
MCA was entitled to summary judgment on this ground. </p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 902.</p>

exemption, we look to our definition of commercial speech under our First
Amendment caselaw. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104&#8211;374, at 8, <i>reprinted in</i>
1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1035 (the exemption �expressly incorporates the concept
of �commercial� speech from the �commercial speech� doctrine�); 141 Cong. Rec.
S19306&#8211;10, S19311 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995) (the exemption �is consistent
with existing [First Amendment] case law�). �Although the boundary between
commercial and noncommercial speech has yet to be clearly delineated, the �core
notion of commercial speech� is that it �does no more than propose a commercial
transaction.�� <i>Hoffman v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.,</i> 255 F.3d 1180, 1184
(9th Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prod's Corp.,</i> 463 U.S. 60,
66, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983)). If speech is not �purely
commercial�&#8212;that is, if it does more than propose a commercial
transaction&#8212;then it is entitled to full First Amendment protection. <i>Id.</i>
at 1185&#8211;86 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Barbie Girl is not purely commercial speech, and is
therefore fully protected. To be sure, MCA used Barbie's name to sell copies of
the song. However, as we've already observed, the song also lampoons the Barbie
image and comments humorously on the cultural values Aqua claims she
represents. Use of the Barbie mark in the song Barbie Girl therefore falls
within the noncommercial use exemption to the FTDA. For precisely the same
reasons, use of the mark in the song's title is also exempted.</p>

Hyundai Motor Am.</a></p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>No. 10 Civ. 1611, 2012 WL 1022247 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22,
2012)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Hyundai Motor Am</i>.,
No. 10 Civ. 1611, 2012 WL 1022247 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2012), the defendant
automobile company ran a television commercial during the post-game show of
the2010 Super Bowl which it described as �a humorous, socio-economic commentary
on luxury defined by a premium price tag, rather than by the value to the
consumer.�&nbsp; The commercial included a one-second shot of a basketball
decorated with a pattern resembling the trademarks of the plaintiff.&nbsp;
Plaintiff sued for trademark infringement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court granted LV�s motion for summary judgment on its
dilution claim.&nbsp; After working through the test for blurring under the
TDRA, the court considered whether Hyundai�s use qualified under the Lanham Act
� 43(c)(3)(A)(ii), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii), exception from dilution liability
for �identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark
owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.�&nbsp; The court found
that it did not so qualify.&nbsp; The court quoted at length from the
deposition testimony of Christopher J. Perry, a marketing executive at Hyundai
at the time the commercial was created:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. Okay. Why didn't you just use the [un-altered]
Louis Vuitton marks?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. I don't recall the-Innocean came back to us and
suggested adjustments.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. Well, why didn't you say, gee, to make the
as-sociation even stronger, let's just use the Louis Vuitton marks?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. The intent of the spot wasn't to-was to portray
these over-the-top overwhelming luxury ideas.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. Right. And, in fact, you weren't commenting in any
way or giving any commentary on Louis Vuit-ton, were you?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[Defense counsel]: Objection to the form. You may
answer.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. No.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. And the point here was not to actually make fun of
Louis Vuitton or criticize Louis Vuitton, was it?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[Defense counsel]: Objection to the form.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. That is correct.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. So why not use the Louis Vuitton marks
them-selves?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[Defense counsel]: Askedand answered. You may answer.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. I suppose we could have. We opted not to. It
wasn't the intent to try to&#8212;the intent wasn't specific to&#8212;the same
reason why we didn't use specific brands on any of the other things we did. It
was just to convey luxury. And to your point that the brown and gold conveyed
luxury.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. The intent wasn't to say anything about Louis
Vuitton, was it?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[Defense counsel]: Asked and answered.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. Correct</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Louis Vuitton v. Hyundai</i>, at 17.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on this and other testimony, and indeed on defendant�s
counsel�s repeated statements to the court that the commercial at issue did not
seek to comment directly on Louis Vuitton, the court found that the commercial
could not qualify as �identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting
upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner.�</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>No. 11 Civ. 24110, 2013 WL 3288039 (S.D. Fla. June 28,
2013)</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>MPS Entm't, LLC v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc</i>.,
No. 11 Civ. 24110, 2013 WL 3288039 (S.D. Fla. June 28, 2013), the defendant
clothing store began selling a t-shirt (shown above on left) bearing the phrase
�The Fitchuation� in February 2010.&nbsp; �The Fituchuation� referred to Michael
Sorrentino, one of the stars of the reality television show Jersey Shore, which
ran on MTV from 2009 to 2012 (above on left).&nbsp; In October 2010,
Sorrentino, through the plaintiff, filed an application at the PTO to register
the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>the situation</span> for
entertainment services.&nbsp; At the time of the opinion, Sorrentino was
selling t-shirts on his website containing the words �The Situation� and
�Official Situation Nation.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2011, after Sorrentino appeared in the show wearing
various of the defendant�s trademarks, the defendant sent a letter to MTV
offering to pay up to $10,000 to cast members <u>not</u> to wear any clothing
bearing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch trademarks.&nbsp; The letter stated:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A &amp; F obviously has not sought product placement
on the show, and we believe that, since the character portrayed by Mr.
Sorrentino is not brand appropriate, his display of A &amp; F clothing could be
misconstrued as an endorsement by him of our clothing or&#8212;worse&#8212;an
endorsement by A &amp; F of his wearing our clothing.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>We have no interest at this point in pursuing any
sort of legal action against MTV or the producers of �Jersey Shore.� In fact,
we would be willing to pay MTV or Mr. Sorrentino or other characters up to
$10,000 NOT to wear any clothing bearing the �ABERCROMBIE &amp; FITCH,� �A
&amp; F,� �FITCH,� �MOOSE� or related trademarks. For additional episodes aired
this season, we would appreciate it if you would ensure that our brands are
pixilated or otherwise appropriately masked.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at *2.&nbsp; Defendant also issued a press
release announcing its offer to the cast members of Jersey Shore and singled
out Sorrentino by name: �We have therefore offered a substantial payment to
Michael �The Situation� Sorrentino and the producers of MTV's <em><span
style='font-family:Cambria'>The Jersey Shore</span></em> to have the character
wear an alternate brand.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Plaintiff sued on the ground that the t-shirt bearing the
term �The Fitchuation� and the press release violated his trademark rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court granted the defendant�s motion for summary
judgment.&nbsp; It applied the Eleventh Circuit�s multifactor test for the
likelihood of consumer confusion to find that the t-shirt did not create a likelihood
of confusion. As to the similarity of the marks factor,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The target of A &amp; F's parody is �The Situation.� The
t-shirt expresses �The Fitchuation� visually and phonetically different than
�The Situation.� There is no evidence of A &amp; F �palming off� its t-shirt as
that of the plaintiffs where, as here, the t-shirt has the A &amp; F inside
label and prominently uses A &amp; F's own famous trademark �Fitch� as part of
the parody.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at *7. On the proximity of the goods or
services,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A &amp; F's apparel goods are dissimilar to the plaintiffs'
entertainment services. The plaintiffs concede that they did not offer apparel
under a �Situation� mark until after A &amp; F introduced �The Fitchuation�
t-shirt. There is no evidence that the public attributes the parties'
respective goods and services to the same single source.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>.&nbsp; The court found in favor of the
defendant on the intent and actual confusion factors as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to the press release, the court found nominative fair
use:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The Court finds that the use of Michael Sorrentino's name
and nickname in the press release was a non-actionable fair use under trademark
law. A &amp; F used only so much of the plaintiff's name as was reasonably
necessary to respond to his wearing A &amp; F's brand on The Jersey Shore, and
did not do anything that would suggest Sorrentino's sponsorship or endorsement.
A &amp; F's press release expressly disassociated Sorrentino from A &amp; F,
and the plaintiffs have conceded that no third party has expressed any
confusion that the press release rejecting Sorrentino's image somehow suggested
sponsorship or endorsement by Sorrentino.</p>

Abandonment</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A defendant may show that a mark has been abandoned and is
thus unprotectable by showing either that (1) the plaintiff has ceased to use
the mark and has no intent to resume use, or (2) the plaintiff has failed to
control the use of the mark (for example, by licensing its use
indiscriminately) with the result that the mark has lost its significance as a
designation of source.&nbsp; These two modes of abandonment are based on the
definition of �abandoned� in Lanham Act � 45, 15 U.S.C. � 1127:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A mark shall be deemed to be �abandoned� if either of
the following occurs:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(1) When its use has been discontinued with intent
not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from
circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of
abandonment. �Use� of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark made in the
ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(2) When any course of conduct of the owner, including
acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to become the generic
name for the goods or services on or in connection with which it is used or
otherwise to lose its significance as a mark. Purchaser motivation shall not be
a test for determining abandonment under this paragraph.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Raggi, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. <i>Trademark Infringement</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC sues defendants for trademark infringement in
violation of both federal and state law. Under section 32(1)(a) of the Lanham
Act, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a), the owner of a mark registered with the
Patent and Trademark Office can bring a civil action against a person alleged
to have used the mark without the owner's consent. Similarly, under New York
state law, a mark owner may maintain a statutory or common law action against a
party who engages in unauthorized use of the mark. <i>See</i> N.Y. Gen. Bus.
Law � 360&#8211;k (McKinney 2006) (protecting registered marks); <i>Norden
Rest. Corp. v. Sons of the Revolution,</i> 51 N.Y.2d 518, 522&#8211;23, 434
N.Y.S.2d 967, 968, 415 N.E.2d 956 (1980) (acknowledging common law rights in
unregistered marks). Even if a plaintiff makes the showing required by federal
and state law, however, the alleged infringer may nevertheless prevail if it
can establish the owner's prior abandonment of the mark. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. �
1115(b)(2); <i>Nercessian v. Homasian Carpet Enter., Inc.,</i> 60 N.Y.2d 875,
877, 470 N.Y.S.2d 363, 364, 458 N.E.2d 822 (1983) (holding that �rights in a
trade name may be lost by abandonment�). Indeed, abandonment is not only an
affirmative defense to an infringement action; it is a ground for cancelling a
federally registered mark. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1064(3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Relying on this principle, defendants submit that
ITC's infringement claim is necessarily defeated as a matter of law by proof
that, by the time they opened their Bukhara Grill restaurants in New York, ITC
had effectively abandoned the Bukhara mark in the United States. Like the
district court, we conclude that defendants successfully established
abandonment as a matter of law, warranting both summary judgment in their favor
and cancellation of ITC's registered mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. <i>The Doctrine of Abandonment</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The abandonment doctrine derives from the
well-established principle that trademark rights are acquired and maintained
through use of a particular mark. <i>See Pirone v. MacMillan, Inc.,</i> 894
F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir.1990) (��There is no such thing as property in a
trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in
connection with which the mark is employed.�� (quoting <i>United Drug Co. v.
Theodore Rectanus Co.,</i> 248 U.S. 90, 97 (1918))). This is true even of marks
that have been registered with the Patent and Trademark Office. <i>See Basile,
S.p.A. v. Basile,</i> 899 F.2d 35, 37 n. 1 (D.C.Cir.1990) (�Although [a mark's]
registration is a predicate to its protection under [section 32(1)(a) of] the
Lanham Act, the underlying right depends not on registration but rather on
use.�). Indeed, one of the fundamental premises underlying the registration
provisions in the Lanham Act is that trademark rights flow from priority and
that priority is acquired through use. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1057(c)
(stating that registration of mark �shall constitute constructive use of the
mark, conferring a right of priority, nationwide in effect ... against any
other person except for a person whose mark has not been abandoned and who,
prior to such filing[,] ... has used the mark�). Thus, so long as a person is
the first to use a particular mark to identify his goods or services in a given
market, and so long as that owner continues to make use of the mark, he is
�entitled to prevent others from using the mark to describe their own goods� in
that market. <i>Defiance Button Mach. Co. v. C &amp; C Metal Prods. Corp.,</i>
759 F.2d 1053, 1059 (2d Cir.1985); <i>see also Sengoku Works v. RMC Int'l,</i>
96 F.3d 1217, 1219 (9th Cir.1996) (�It is axiomatic in trademark law that the
standard test of ownership is priority of use.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If, however, an owner ceases to use a mark without
an intent to resume use in the reasonably foreseeable future, the mark is said
to have been �abandoned.� <i>See Silverman v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d 40, 45
(2d Cir.1989); 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition, � 17:5, at 17&#8211;8 (4th ed.2002) (observing that �abandonment�
refers to situations involving the �non-use of a mark, coupled with an express
or implied intention to abandon or not to resume use�). Once abandoned, a mark
returns to the public domain and may, in principle, be appropriated for use by
other actors in the marketplace, <i>see Indianapolis Colts, Inc. v. Metro.
Baltimore Football Club Ltd. P'ship,</i> 34 F.3d 410, 412 (7th Cir.1994), in accordance
with the basic rules of trademark priority, <i>see Manhattan Indus., Inc. v.
Sweater Bee by Banff, Ltd.,</i> 627 F.2d 628, 630 (2d Cir.1980).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. <i>Demonstrating Abandonment</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The party asserting abandonment bears the burden of
persuasion with respect to two facts: (1) non-use of the mark by the legal
owner, and (2) lack of intent by that owner to resume use of the mark in the
reasonably foreseeable future. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1127; <i>Stetson v.
Howard D. Wolf &amp; Assocs.,</i> 955 F.2d 847, 850 (2d Cir.1992); <i>Silverman
v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d at 45; <i>see also On&#8211;Line Careline, Inc. v.
America Online, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 1080, 1087 (Fed.Cir.2000) (placing burden of
persuasion on party seeking cancellation on ground of abandonment); <i>Warner
Bros. Inc. v. Gay Toys, Inc.,</i> 724 F.2d 327, 334 (2d Cir.1983) (placing
burden of persuasion on party asserting abandonment as defense).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC concedes that defendants satisfied the first
element through proof that ITC has not used the Bukhara mark for restaurant
services in the United States since August 28, 1997. Nevertheless, ITC insists
that a triable issue of fact exists with respect to its intent to resume use of
the service mark in the United States. To the extent the district court
concluded otherwise, ITC submits the court applied an incorrect legal standard.
To explain why we are not persuaded by this argument, we begin by discussing
the particular legal significance of non-use of a registered mark for a period
of at least three years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. <i>Prima Facie Evidence of Abandonment</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Lanham Act expressly states that �[n]onuse� of
a mark �for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment.�
15 U.S.C. � 1127. This court has explained that the term �prima facie evidence�
in this context means �a rebuttable presumption of abandonment.� <i>Saratoga
Vichy Spring Co. v. Lehman,</i> 625 F.2d 1037, 1044 (2d Cir.1980); <i>accord
Silverman v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d at 45.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The role played by such a presumption is best understood by
reference to Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided
for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party
against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut
or to meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of
proof in the sense of the risk of non-persuasion, which remains throughout the
trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Fed.R.Evid. 301. Although the term �presumption� is not
specifically defined in the Rules of Evidence, it is generally understood to
mean �an assumption of fact resulting from a rule of law which requires such
fact to be assumed from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise
established in the action.� 21B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham,
Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure � 5124 (2d ed.2005); <i>accord</i> Joseph
M. McLaughlin, Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal
Evidence � 301.02[1] (2d ed.2006); <i>see also Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v.
Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 256 n. 10 (1981) (describing presumption as �legally
mandatory inference�). The assumption ceases to operate, however, upon the
proffer of contrary evidence. <i>See generally A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L.
Chaides Constr. Co.,</i> 960 F.2d 1020, 1037 (Fed.Cir.1992) (observing that
under Rule 301, a �presumption is not merely rebuttable but completely vanishes
upon the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the
nonexistence of the presumed fact�); <i>Saratoga Vichy Spring Co. v. Lehman,</i>
625 F.2d at 1043 (suggesting that presumption of abandonment �disappears when
rebutted by contrary evidence�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, in this case, the statutory presumption of
abandonment requires that one fact, i.e., abandonment, be inferred from another
fact, i.e., non-use of the mark for three years or more. The significance of a
presumption of abandonment is to shift the burden of production to the mark
owner to come forward with evidence indicating that, despite three years of
non-use, it intended to resume use of the mark within a reasonably foreseeable
time. <i>See Imperial Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 899 F.2d 1575,
1579 (Fed.Cir.1990) (noting that triggering of presumption �eliminates the
challenger's burden to establish the [lack of] intent [to resume use] element
of abandonment as an initial part of its case�); <i>see also Cumulus Media,
Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns,</i> 304 F.3d 1167, 1176&#8211;77 (11th
Cir.2002); <i>On&#8211;Line Careline, Inc. v. America Online, Inc.,</i> 229
F.3d at 1087. The ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of abandonment,
however, remains at all times with the alleged infringer. <i>See Emergency One,
Inc. v. American FireEagle, Ltd.,</i> 228 F.3d 531, 536 (4th Cir.2000).</p>

Abandonment</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court has observed that �to overcome a
presumption of abandonment after a sufficiently long period of non-use, a
defendant need show only an intention to resume use �within the reasonably
foreseeable future.� � <i>Empresa Cubana del Tabaco v. Culbro Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d
462, 468 n. 2 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Silverman v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d at
45). ITC submits that the district court erred in imposing a stricter standard,
specifically requiring ITC to adduce ��objective, hard evidence of actual
concrete plans to resume use in the reasonably foreseeable future when the
conditions requiring suspension abate�� to defeat defendants' summary judgment
motion. <i>ITC Ltd. v. Punchgini, Inc.,</i> 373 F.Supp.2d at 280 (quoting <i>Emmpresa
Cubana Del Tabaco v. Culbro&nbsp; Corp.,</i> 213 F.Supp.2d 247, 268&#8211;69
(S.D.N.Y.2002)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court has, in fact, criticized the particular
language quoted by the district court, observing that such a �heavy burden� is
not required by our precedent. <i>See Empresa Cubana del Tabaco v. Culbro
Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d at 467 n. 2. Courts and commentators are in general
agreement that proffered evidence is �sufficient� to rebut a presumption as
long as the evidence could support a reasonable jury finding of �the nonexistence
of the presumed fact.� <i>Wanlass v. Fedders Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 1461, 1464
(Fed.Cir.1998); <i>see also</i> McLaughlin, Weinstein &amp; Berger, <i>supra,</i>
� 301.02 [3] [c] (stating that �the opponent of a presumed fact, in order to
rebut, generally has the burden of presenting evidence so that a reasonable
jury could be convinced of the non-existence of the presumed fact�); Wright
&amp; Graham, <i>supra,</i> � 5126 (�Most writers ... interpret 301 to require
that rebutting evidence suffice to support a finding of the non-existence of the
presumed fact.�). In short, upon defendants' presentation of evidence
establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case of abandonment under the Lanham Act, ITC
was required to come forward only with such contrary evidence as, when viewed
in the light most favorable to ITC, would permit a reasonable jury to infer
that it had not abandoned the mark. Specifically, it needed to adduce
sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that, in the
three-year period of non-use&#8212;from August 28, 1997, when ITC terminated
the Chicago Bukhara franchise, to August 28, 2000&#8212;ITC nevertheless
maintained an intent to resume use of its registered mark in the reasonably
foreseeable future.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span

<i>See Silverman v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d at 47; <i>accord Empresa Cubana del
Tabaco v. Culbro Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d at 467 n. 2. Hard evidence of concrete
plans to resume use of the mark would certainly carry this burden. But we do
not foreclose the possibility that other circumstances, viewed in the light
most favorable to the non-movant, might also support the necessary jury
inference of intent. <i>See, e.g., Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs.,
Inc.,</i> 386 F.3d 485, 506 (2d Cir.2004) (looking to totality of circumstances
to infer intent).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>5. <i>Defendants' Entitlement to Summary Judgment</i></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>a. <i>The District Court Did Not Apply an Incorrect
Standard</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying these principles to this case, we
preliminarily observe that, despite the language cited by ITC, the district
court does not appear to have based its summary judgment award on a too strict
evidentiary standard of rebuttal with respect to the presumption of
abandonment. To the contrary, the district court's ruling, when considered in
its entirety, reveals a careful review of the totality of the evidence adduced
by ITC and a correct conclusion that no circumstances were adduced from which a
reasonable jury could infer that, during the relevant three-year period of
non-use, ITC nevertheless intended to resume use of the registered mark in the
United States in the reasonably foreseeable future. <i>See ITC Ltd. v.
Punchgini, Inc.,</i> 373 F.Supp.2d at 280 (stating that ITC had �failed to come
forward with any evidence of ... �activities it engaged in during the nonuse
period ... from which an intent to resume use ... may be reasonably inferred�
... to rebut the statutory presumption of abandonment at trial� (quoting <i>Imperial
Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 899 F.2d at 1580)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if the district court had applied an erroneous
standard, however, we would still affirm its judgment if, upon applying the
proper standard on our own review of the record, we were to identify no genuine
issue of material fact requiring trial. <i>See Baker v. Home Depot,</i> 445 F.3d
541, 546 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that we may affirm a district court decision on
any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of
law); <i>Stetson v. Wolf,</i> 955 F.2d at 850 (observing in abandonment case
that �[a]n appellate court has the power to decide cases on appeal if the facts
in the record adequately support the proper result�). This is such a case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>b. <i>ITC's Failure to Adduce Evidence from Which a
Reasonable Jury Could Infer Intent to Resume Use</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As this court has recognized, �intent is always a
subjective matter of inference and thus rarely amenable to summary judgment.� <i>Saratoga
Vichy Spring Co. v. Lehman,</i> 625 F.2d at 1044. At the same time, however, �
�[t]he summary judgment rule would be rendered sterile ... if the mere
incantation of intent or state of mind would operate as a talisman to defeat an
otherwise valid motion.� � <i>Distasio v. Perkin Elmer Corp.,</i> 157 F.3d 55,
61&#8211;62 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Meiri v. Dacon,</i> 759 F.2d 989, 997 (2d
Cir.1985)). The latter point is particularly relevant in the context of an
abandonment dispute, because �[i]n every contested abandonment case, the
respondent denies an intention to abandon its mark; otherwise there would be no
contest.� <i>Imperial Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 899 F.2d at
1581. Thus, courts have generally held that a trademark owner cannot rebut a
presumption of abandonment merely by asserting a subjective intent to resume
use of the mark at some later date. <i>See Vais Arms, Inc. v. Vais,</i> 383
F.3d 287, 294 (5th Cir.2004) (�At most, [the mark owner's] affidavit
establishes only his subjective, uncommunicated desire not to abandon the mark,
without any indication of when or how he intended to resume its commercial use;
it does not establish a genuine issue as to his intent to abandon.�); <i>Emergency
One, Inc. v. American FireEagle, Ltd.,</i> 228 F.3d at 537 (�[T]he owner of a
trademark cannot defeat an abandonment claim ... by simply asserting a vague,
subjective intent to resume use of a mark at some unspecified future date.�); <i>Imperial
Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 899 F.2d at 1581 (�An averment of no
intent to abandon is little more than a denial in a pleading, which is patently
insufficient to preclude summary judgment on the ground the facts are
disputed.�); <i>see also Silverman v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d at 47 (�A bare
assertion of possible future use is not enough.�). Rather, to rebut a
presumption of abandonment on a motion for summary judgment, the mark owner
must come forward with evidence �with respect to ... what outside events
occurred from which an intent to resume use during the nonuse period may
reasonably be inferred.� <i>Imperial Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i>
899 F.2d at 1581; <i>accord</i> <i>Emergency One, Inc. v. American FireEagle,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC argues that four facts would allow a reasonable
factfinder to infer its intent to resume use of the Bukhara mark for
restaurants in the United States: (1) the reasonable grounds for its suspension
of use of the mark, (2) its efforts to develop and market a Dal Bukhara line of
packaged food, (3) its attempts to identify potential United States restaurant
franchisees, and (4) its continued use of the Bukhara mark for restaurants
outside the United States. We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent style='text-indent:.3in'>(1) <i>Grounds for Suspending
Use</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC advances two reasons for suspending use of the
Bukhara mark in the United States from 1997 to 2000:(a) Indian regulations
requiring it to return profits earned abroad severely hindered its ability to
open and operate profitable Bukhara restaurants in the United States, and (b)
depressed market conditions in the hospitality industry from 1988 to 2003
inhibited its development of franchise partnerships in the United States.
Because these reasons are unsupported by record evidence, they plainly cannot
demonstrate the requisite intent.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[42]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As to the first point, the record indicates that
many of the Indian regulations cited by ITC had been in effect since 1973.
Clearly, these regulations did not prevent ITC from opening its Bukhara
restaurant in New York in 1986 or from licensing a Bukhara restaurant in
Chicago in 1987. Although ITC submits that the regulations were a significant
factor in the failure of these two restaurants, no evidence was adduced to
support this conclusory assertion. <i>See generally Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank,</i>
201 F.3d 134, 142 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that conclusory statements,
conjecture, and inadmissible evidence are insufficient to defeat summary
judgment). Indeed, the record is to the contrary. When, at deposition, an ITC
corporate representative was asked why the New York Bukhara closed, he replied
simply that the restaurant was highly leveraged and unable to meet its debt
obligations. He made no mention of any Indian regulations. Similarly, the
letter by which ITC terminated its Chicago license agreement referenced only
the franchisee's failure to pay fees owed to ITC, making no mention of Indian
regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Further, ITC fails to explain how Indian
regulations, which ITC claims applied to any business operated outside India,
hindered its use of the Bukhara mark for restaurants in the United States
between 1997 and 2000 but permitted it to open a Bukhara restaurant in the
United Arab Emirates in 1998. To the extent ITC argues that the regulations
limited its options by effectively requiring it to partner exclusively with
well-established hotels, it offers no evidence that hotels in the United States
were unreceptive to such a partnership arrangement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With respect to ITC's argument that a market
decline in the hospitality industry between 1988 and 2003 explains its non-use
of the mark, the record indicates only a decline in India and the overseas
market. ITC proffered no evidence demonstrating a decline in the United States
hospitality market during the relevant 1997&#8211;2000 period of non-use.<a
href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) <i>Marketing Dal Bukhara Food Products</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC points to only one piece of evidence during the
relevant 1997&#8211;2000 period indicating its intent to use the name Bukhara
in connection with packaged foods: the minutes from a July 27, 2000 corporate
management committee meeting in India, which approved an initiative to market
food products under the name �Bukhara Dal.� Significantly, the minutes nowhere
indicate ITC's intent to market this product in the United States, much less
ITC's intent to resume use of the Bukhara mark for restaurants in this country.
Accordingly, we conclude that the minutes, by themselves, are insufficient to
create a genuine issue of material fact as to ITC's intent to resume use of its
registered service mark in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The remaining evidence adduced by ITC all
post-dates the relevant 1997&#8211;2000 period of non-use. Specifically, in
2001, ITC commissioned a study regarding the marketing of packaged food bearing
the Bukhara mark in the United States. That same year, ITC filed trademark
applications for several marks containing the word �Bukhara� in relation to
packaged food products. Not until 2003 did ITC actually showcase its packaged
food line at a New York trade show or sell these products to two United States
distributors. These acts, all occurring well after 2000 and suggesting future
use of the Bukhara mark for a product other than restaurants, are insufficient
to support the necessary inference that, <i>in the non-use period</i>, ITC
maintained an intent to resume use of the mark for restaurants in the United
States in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(3) <i>Identifying Bukhara Franchisees</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC argues that evidence of its discussions with
various persons about expanding the Bukhara restaurant franchise to New York,
California, and Texas creates a jury issue as to its intent to resume use of
its registered mark within a reasonably foreseeable time. In fact, the only
evidence of these so-called �discussions� is a few facsimiles, e-mails, and
letters sent to ITC over a five-year period from 1998 to 2002. There is no
evidence that ITC initiated any of these contacts. More to the point, no
evidence indicates that ITC responded to or seriously considered these
unsolicited proposals in a manner that would permit a reasonable jury to infer
its intent to resume use of its Bukhara mark for restaurants. As such, these
communications, even when viewed in the light most favorable to ITC, do not
give rise to a material question of fact on the issue of ITC's intent to resume
use of its registered mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC submits that record evidence also reveals its
negotiations to expand the Bukhara restaurant brand into Starwood hotels. The
proffered evidence consists of (1) a 2002 letter from Starwood's
Asia&#8211;Pacific headquarters indicating a general interest in operating
Bukhara restaurants in some of its hotels outside India, and (2) a 2004 story
from an Indian newspaper about ITC's intent to open Bukhara restaurants in
London and Tokyo. Neither document references the possible opening of a Bukhara
restaurant in the United States. Moreover, both the letter and the news story
post-date the 1997&#8211;2000 period of non-use that gives rise to the
presumption of abandonment, and they make no mention of any intent to resume
use arising during this critical time frame. Accordingly, this evidence is
insufficient to raise a material issue of fact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(4) <i>Bukhara Restaurants Outside the United States</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, ITC cites <i>La Societe Anonyme des
Parfums le Galion v. Jean Patou, Inc.</i> to support its argument that the
continued operation of its Bukhara restaurants outside the United States
demonstrates �an ongoing program to exploit the mark commercially,� giving rise
to an inference of an intent to resume the mark's use in this country, 495 F.2d
1265, 1272 (2d Cir.1974). In fact, ITC's reliance on <i>Societe Anonyme</i> is
misplaced. In that case, this court ruled that a �meager trickle� of perfume
sales within the United States&#8212;89 bottles sold over a period of 20
years&#8212;was insufficient to establish trademark rights in the United
States. <i>Id.</i> Nothing in that case suggests that ongoing foreign use of a
mark, by itself, supports an inference that the owner intends to re-employ a
presumptively abandoned mark in the United States. Cf. <i>id.</i> at 1271 n. 4
(noting �well-settled� view �that foreign use is ineffectual to create
trademark rights in the United States�). Indeed, we identify no authority supporting
that conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, like the district court, we conclude
that ITC's continued foreign use of the Bukhara mark for restaurants does not
raise a material issue of fact regarding its intent to resume similar use of
the mark in the United States. Because ITC plainly abandoned its right to the
Bukhara mark for restaurant services in the United States, we affirm the award
of summary judgment in favor of defendants on ITC's federal and state
infringement claims.</p>

sustained Mattel, Inc.'s (�Mattel�) challenge to The Crash Dummy Movie, LLC's
(�CDM�) application to register the mark CRASH DUMMIES for a line of games and
playthings. The record leaves no doubt that CDM's proposed mark is likely to
cause confusion with Mattel's previously used marks CRASH DUMMIES and THE
INCREDIBLE CRASH DUMMIES (collectively, �CRASH DUMMIES marks�) for action
figures and playsets. CDM asserts, however, that these marks were abandoned.
Because substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Mattel overcame
the statutory presumption of abandonment of its CRASH DUMMIES marks, this court
affirms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mattel's predecessor-in-interest, Tyco Industries,
Inc. (�Tyco�), first produced a line of toys under the CRASH DUMMIES marks in
1991. In 1993, Tyco obtained federal trademark registrations for the CRASH
DUMMIES marks: CRASH DUMMIES (Registration No. 1809338) and THE INCREDIBLE
CRASH DUMMIES (Registration No. 1773754). Tyco sold toys under the CRASH
DUMMIES marks through at least 1994. In addition, Tyco entered into forty-nine
licenses for use of the CRASH DUMMIES marks in connection with a variety of
products. The licenses expired on December 31, 1995, with some licenses having
a product sell-off period of four to six months following their expiration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On July 14, 1995, CDM entered into an option
agreement with Tyco to produce a motion picture based on Tyco's line of toys
sold under the CRASH DUMMIES marks. The option agreement expired on July 14,
1996. Although CDM attempted to renegotiate a license later that year, Tyco
declined to enter into another option agreement with CDM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the mid-1990's, Tyco experienced financial
difficulties and began negotiating an acquisition with Mattel. On February 12,
1997, Tyco assigned its trademark portfolio, including the CRASH DUMMIES marks,
to Mattel. Mattel officially purchased Tyco on December 31, 1997. Mattel later
recorded Tyco's assignment with the United States Patent Trademark Office
(�USPTO�) on February 13, 1998. Due to the size of the acquisition, the two
businesses did not fully integrate until late 2004 or early 2005.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1998, KB Toys approached Mattel, hoping to
become the exclusive retailer of toys sold under the CRASH DUMMIES marks.
Mattel declined the offer. Mattel needed to retool Tyco's CRASH DUMMIES toys in
order to meet Mattel's stringent safety standards. Mattel determined that the
cost of retooling was too significant in light of KB Toys's sales projections
at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> From 2000 to 2003, Mattel worked on developing a
new line of toys under the CRASH DUMMIES marks. In 2000, Mattel began
brainstorming ideas for CRASH DUMMIES toys. Mattel researched, developed, and
tested its new toys as early as 2001, and obtained concept approval by 2002.
Mattel began manufacturing CRASH DUMMIES toys in October 2003, and ultimately
reintroduced them into the market in December 2003. While Mattel was developing
new toys, the USPTO cancelled the registrations for the CRASH DUMMIES marks on
December 29, 2000, because Mattel did not file a section 8 declaration of use
and/or excusable nonuse for the marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On March 31, 2003, CDM filed an intent-to-use
application for the mark CRASH DUMMIES for games and playthings. Mattel opposed
CDM's application, claiming priority to Tyco's prior registration and use of
the CRASH DUMMIES marks. Mattel and CDM agree that their respective marks are
likely to cause confusion. The only disputed issue before the Board was whether
Mattel was entitled to claim common law trademark rights to the CRASH DUMMIES
marks predating CDM's March 2003 filing date. The Board found a prima facie
abandonment of the CRASH DUMMIES marks based on three years of nonuse,
beginning at the earliest on December 31, 1995, and ending at Mattel's actual
shipment of CRASH DUMMIES toys in December 2003. However, the Board concluded
that Mattel rebutted the presumption of abandonment of its common law trademark
rights by showing �reasonable grounds for the suspension and plans to resume
use in the reasonably foreseeable future when the conditions requiring
suspension abate.� CDM appeals the Board's decision sustaining Mattel's
opposition. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. � 1295(a)(4)(B).</p>

which this court reviews for substantial evidence. <i>On-Line Careline, Inc. v.
Am. Online, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 1080, 1087 (Fed.Cir.2000). The substantial

<p class=Centered>III.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A registered trademark is considered abandoned if
its �use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.� 15 U.S.C. �
1127 (2006). �Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of
abandonment.� <i>Id.</i> A showing of a prima facie case creates a rebuttable
presumption that the trademark owner has abandoned the mark without intent to
resume use. <i>On-Line Careline,</i> 229 F.3d at 1087. �The burden then shifts
to the trademark owner to produce evidence that he either used the mark during
the statutory period or intended to resume use.� <i>Id.</i> �The burden of
persuasion, however, always remains with the [challenger] to prove abandonment
by a preponderance of the evidence.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As an initial matter, CDM does not challenge the
Board's finding that Tyco did not abandon the CRASH DUMMIES marks before the
1997 assignment. CDM only challenges the Board's factual finding regarding
Mattel's intent to resume use after it acquired the marks in February 1997
until it began selling CRASH DUMMIES toys in December 2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding
that Mattel intended to resume use of the CRASH DUMMIES marks during the
contested time period. First, in 1998, Mattel entered into discussions with KB
Toys about becoming the exclusive retailer of CRASH DUMMIES toys. Mattel
considered the relative merits of exclusive sales through KB Toys and the high
cost of retooling Tyco's product line to meet Mattel's stringent safety
standards. Mattel's analysis shows that it contemplated manufacturing toys
under the CRASH DUMMIES marks at the time the discussion took place. Although
Mattel did not ultimately enter into the KB Toys agreement, no evidence
suggests that Mattel rejected the business opportunity because it decided to
abandon the marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, common sense supports the conclusion that
Mattel would not have recorded Tyco's trademark assignment with the USPTO in
1998 unless it intended to use the CRASH DUMMIES mark within the foreseeable
future. Although Mattel later allowed its trademark registrations to lapse,
cancellation of a trademark registration does not necessarily translate into
abandonment of common law trademark rights. Nor does it establish its owner's
lack of intent to use the mark. <i>See Miller Brewing Co. v. Oland's Breweries
(1971), Ltd.,</i> 548 F.2d 349, 352 n. 4 (CCPA 1976) (�Although Oland &amp;
Son's registration was cancelled in January of 1968 for failure to file a
continued use affidavit, this, in and of itself, does not show an intent to
abandon.�) (citation omitted). Therefore, Mattel's failure to file a timely
Section 8 declaration of use and/or excusable nonuse for the marks does not
negate Mattel's intent to resume use of the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Third, substantial evidence supports the Board's
finding that Mattel's research and development efforts from 2000 to 2003
indicate its intent to resume use of the marks. Mattel relied on its internal
documents and testimony by Peter Frank, Mattel's marketing manager, to describe
its product development activities. Based on the documents, Frank testified
that Mattel began brainstorming ideas for the CRASH DUMMIES toys in 2000,
researched and tested them in 2001, and obtained concept approval in 2002. He
also explained that Mattel began manufacturing the CRASH DUMMIES toys in
October 2003, culminating in actual shipment in December 2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition, Mattel's shipment of CRASH DUMMIES
toys in December 2003 supports Frank's testimony about Mattel's research and
development efforts in the early 2000's. This court does not disregard this
record evidence because it falls outside of the three-year statutory period of
nonuse. The Board may consider evidence and testimony regarding Mattel's
practices that occurred before or after the three-year statutory period to
infer Mattel's intent to resume use during the three-year period. <i>See Miller
Brewing Co. v. Oland's Breweries,</i> 548 F.2d 349, 352 (CCPA 1976)
(considering evidence beyond a statutory period to affirm the Board's decision
to sustain opposition to a trademark application). Therefore, substantial
evidence shows that Mattel continuously worked on developing CRASH DUMMIES toys
from 2000 to 2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mattel needed sufficient time to research, develop,
and market its retooled CRASH DUMMIES toys after acquiring Tyco's CRASH DUMMIES
marks in 1997. Despite Mattel's delay in utilizing the marks for its toys,
substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Mattel rebutted the
statutory presumption of abandonment of the marks. Accordingly, the Board
correctly held that CDM may not register its proposed mark CRASH DUMMIES for a
line of games and playthings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>IV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because substantial evidence supports the Board's
finding that Mattel intended to resume use of the CRASH DUMMIES marks during
the period of non-use, this court affirms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> FreecycleSunnyvale (�FS�) is a member group of The
Freecycle Network (�TFN�), an organization devoted to facilitating the
recycling of goods. FS filed a declaratory action against TFN arising from a
trademark licensing dispute, alleging noninfringement of TFN's trademarks and
tortious interference with FS's business relations. FS moved for partial
summary judgment on the issue of whether its naked licensing defense to
trademark infringement allowed it to avoid a finding of infringement as a
matter of law.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span

TFN argued that it had established adequate quality control standards over its
licensees' services and use of the trademarks to avoid a finding of naked
licensing and abandonment of its trademarks. The district court granted summary
judgment to FS. We hold that TFN (1) did not retain express contractual control
over FS's quality control measures, (2) did not have actual controls over FS's
quality control measures, and (3) was unreasonable in relying on FS's quality
control measures. Because we find that TFN engaged in naked licensing and
thereby abandoned its trademarks, we affirm.</p>

<p class=Centered>A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In March 2003, Deron Beal (�Beal�) founded TFN, an
umbrella non-profit Arizona corporation dedicated to �freecycling.� The term
�freecycling� combines the words �free� and �recycling� and refers to the
practice of giving an unwanted item to a stranger so that it can continue to be
used for its intended purpose, rather than disposing of it.<a href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[45]</span></span></span></a> As practiced by TFN,
freecycling is primarily a local activity conducted by means of internet
groups, which are created by volunteers through online service providers like
Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[46]</span></span></span></a>
Although not required to do so, most TFN member groups use Yahoo! Groups as a
forum for members to coordinate their freecycling activities. TFN also
maintains its own website, www.freecycle.org, which provides a directory of
member groups as well as resources for volunteers to create new groups. The
website also includes a section devoted to etiquette guidelines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN asserts that it maintains a �Freecycle
Ethos�&#8212;a democratic leadership structure, in which decisions are made
through a process of surveys and discussions among volunteer moderators. Local
volunteer moderators are responsible for enforcing TFN's rules and policies,
but the moderators have flexibility in enforcement depending on the moderators'
assessment of their local communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Since May 2003, TFN has been using three
trademarks, FREECYCLE, THE FREECYCLE NETWORK, and a logo (collectively �the
trademarks�) to identify TFN's services and to identify member groups'
affiliation with TFN. Federal registration of the trademarks is currently
pending in the United States, but the trademarks have been registered in other
countries. TFN permits member groups to use the trademarks. When TFN first
started, Beal personally regulated the use of the trademarks but, as TFN has
grown, it has relied on local moderators to regulate member groups' use of the
trademarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Lisanne Abraham (�Abraham�) founded FS on October
7, 2003, in Sunnyvale, California, without TFN's knowledge or involvement. She
established the group by entering into a service contract with Yahoo! Groups
and becoming the group's moderator. Upon establishing FS, Abraham adapted
etiquette guidelines and instructions for how to use FS from either TFN's or
one of TFN's member group's website. On October 7, 2003, Abraham emailed Beal
directly asking for a logo for FS, and they spoke over the phone within days of
the email communication. After the phone conversation, Beal emailed Abraham on
October 9, 2003, stating: �You can get the neutral logo from www.freecycle.org,
just don't use it for commercial purposes or you [sic] maybe Mark or Albert can
help you to do your own fancy schmancy logo!�<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[47]</span></span></span></a>
This email is the only record of a direct communication between FS and TFN
regarding the use of any of the trademarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Between October 7, 2003, and October 9, 2003, FS
was added to TFN's list of online freecycling groups displayed on TFN's
website. Then, on October 9, 2003, Abraham received an email from Beal
addressed to nineteen moderators of new freecycle Yahoo! Groups which, among
other things, welcomed them to TFN. The email did not discuss or include any
restrictions or guidance on the use of TFN's trademarks. On October 13, 2003,
Abraham received another email from TFN, this time an invitation to join the
�freecyclemodsquad� Yahoo! Group (�modsquad group�), an informal discussion
forum exclusively for the moderators of freecycle Yahoo! Groups to share ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Before 2004, TFN had only a few suggested
guidelines in the etiquette section of its website, including a �Keep it Free�
rule. Then, on January 4, 2004, Beal sent an email to the modsquad group,
asking whether TFN should also limit listed items to those that were legal.
Ultimately, Beal proposed the adoption of a �Keep it Free, Legal &amp;
Appropriate for All Ages� rule and asked �that all moderators vote on whether
they feel this is the one rule that should apply to ALL local groups or not.�
Between January 4 and January 11, 2004, a majority of the modsquad group voted
to require all local groups to adopt the rule and, on January 11, Beal informed
the group that �I'm glad to say ... we now have one true guiding principle.�
Although the moderators adopted the �Keep it Free, Legal &amp; Appropriate for
All Ages� rule, following its adoption, they frequently discussed what the
actual meaning of the rule was and, ultimately, its definition and enforcement
varied from group to group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the underlying reason is not evident from
the record or the parties' briefs, on November 1 and November 14, 2005, TFN
sent emails to FS ordering the group to cease and desist using the Freecycle
name and logo and threatening to have Yahoo! terminate FS's Yahoo! Group if FS
did not comply. On November 5, FS emailed Yahoo! and disputed TFN's ability to
forbid the use of the trademarks by informing Yahoo! of the license that TFN
allegedly had granted FS in October 2003 (i.e., Beal's October 9, 2003 email
authorizing Abraham to use the logo). On November 21, Yahoo! terminated the FS
Yahoo! Group at TFN's request, after receiving a claim from TFN that FS was
infringing on TFN's trademark rights.</p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On January 18, 2006, FS filed a declaratory
judgment action against TFN in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, alleging noninfringement of TFN's trademarks and
tortious interference with FS's business relations. TFN brought counterclaims
for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act and
California Business and Professions Code section 17200.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> FS then moved for summary judgment on the issue of
whether its naked licensing defense to trademark infringement allowed it to
avoid a finding of infringement as a matter of law. FS argued that TFN had
abandoned its trademarks because it engaged in naked licensing when it granted
FS the right to use the trademarks without either (1) the right to control or
(2) the exercise of actual control over FS's activities. On March 13, 2008, the
district court granted summary judgment in favor of FS, holding that TFN
engaged in naked licensing and therefore abandoned its rights to the trademarks.
The parties stipulated to dismiss the remaining claims, and final judgment was
entered on May 20, 2008. TFN thereafter timely filed its appeal.</p>

issue appear to have interpreted the �strictly proven� standard to require
�clear and convincing� evidence of naked licensing. <i>See</i> 3 J. Thomas

<p class=Centered>III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> An introduction to �naked licensing� of trademarks
is in order, as this issue has seldom arisen in this circuit or in our sister
circuits. Our only discussion of this subject is in <i>Barcamerica,</i> 289
F.3d at 598 (holding that Barcamerica, a vintner, engaged in naked licensing
and abandoned its trademark by failing to retain or otherwise exercise adequate
quality control over the trademark it had licensed to another company), and
that decision informs and guides our discussion here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a general matter, trademark owners have a duty
to control the quality of their trademarks. McCarthy � 18:48. �It is
well-established that �[a] trademark owner may grant a license and remain
protected provided quality control of the goods and services sold under the
trademark by the licensee is maintained.� � <i>Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at
595&#8211;96 (quoting <i>Moore Bus. Forms, Inc. v. Ryu,</i> 960 F.2d 486, 489

Naked licensing may result in the trademark's ceasing to function as a symbol
of quality and a controlled source. <i>Id.</i> (citing McCarthy � 18:48). We
have previously declared that naked licensing is �<i>inherently deceptive</i>
and constitutes abandonment of any rights to the trademark by the licensor.� <i>Id.</i>
at 598. �Consequently, where the licensor fails to exercise adequate quality
control over the licensee, �a court may find that the trademark owner has
abandoned the trademark, in which case the owner would be estopped from asserting
rights to the trademark.�� <i>Id.</i> at 596 (quoting <i>Moore,</i> 960 F.2d at

<p class=Centered>A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At issue here is whether there is clear and
convincing evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to TFN, that TFN
allowed FS to use the trademarks with so few restrictions as to compel a
finding that TFN engaged in naked licensing and abandoned the trademarks. TFN
contends that disputed issues of material fact remain as to whether TFN's
quality control standards, during the relevant time period, were sufficient.
Although TFN concedes that it did not have an express license agreement, it
alleges that a reasonable jury could find that it had adequate quality control
measures in place when FS was authorized to use the trademarks, making summary
judgment inappropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When deciding summary judgment on claims of naked
licensing, we first determine whether the license contained an express
contractual right to inspect and supervise the licensee's operations. <i>See
Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at 596. The absence of an agreement with provisions
restricting or monitoring the quality of goods or services produced under a
trademark supports a finding of naked licensing. <i>Id.</i> at 597; <i>see also
Stanfield v. Osborne Indus., Inc.,</i> 52 F.3d 867, 871 (10th Cir.1995)
(granting summary judgment where license agreement lacked right to inspect or
supervise licensee's operations and gave the licensee sole discretion to design
the trademark).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN concedes that it did not have an express
license agreement with FS regarding FS's use of the trademarks. Without an
express license agreement, TFN necessarily lacks express contractual rights to
inspect and supervise FS. However, TFN argues that the October 9, 2003 email,
in which Beal advised Abraham that: �You can get the neutral logo from
www.freecycle.org, <i>just don't use it for commercial purposes</i>....�,
reflects an implied license. Emphasis added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even assuming that Beal's emailed admonition to
Abraham not to use the trademarks for commercial purposes constitutes an
implied licensing agreement, it contained no express contractual right to
inspect or supervise FS's services and no ability to terminate FS's license if
FS used the trademarks for commercial purposes. <i>See Barcamerica,</i> 289
F.3d at 597 (determining that a license agreement lacking similar controls was
insufficient). We therefore hold that, by TFN's own admission, there is no
disputed issue of material fact as to whether TFN maintained an express
contractual right to control quality.</p>

<p class=Centered>2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN next contends that, despite its lack of an
express contractual <i>right to</i> control quality, a material issue of fact
remains as to whether TFN maintained <i>actual</i> control over its member
groups' services and use of the trademarks when FS was granted use of the
trademarks in October 2003. �The lack of an express contract right to inspect
and supervise a licensee's operations is not conclusive evidence of lack of
control.� <i>Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at 596. However, where courts have
excused the lack of a contractual right to control quality, they have still
required that the licensor demonstrate <i>actual</i> control through inspection
or supervision. <i>See, e.g., Stanfield,</i> 52 F.3d at 871 (�The absence of an
express contractual right of control does not necessarily result in abandonment
of a mark, as long as the licensor in fact exercised sufficient control over
its licensee.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN asserts that it exercised actual control over
the trademarks because it had several quality control standards in place,
specifically: (1) the �Keep it Free, Legal, and Appropriate for all Ages�
standard and TFN's incorporation of the Yahoo! Groups' service terms; (2) the
non-commercial services requirement (expressed in Beal's October 9, 2003
email); (3) the etiquette guidelines listed on TFN's website; and (4) TFN's
�Freecycle Ethos� which, TFN contends, establishes policies and procedures for
member groups, even if local member groups are permitted flexibility in how to
apply those policies and procedures. In addition, TFN cites <i>Birthright v.
Birthright, Inc.,</i> 827 F.Supp. 1114 (D.N.J.1993) for the principle that
loosely organized non-profits like TFN and FS that share �the common goals of a
public service organization� are subject to less stringent quality control
requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, we disagree with TFN's contentions that the
�Keep it Free, Legal, and Appropriate for all Ages� standard and its
incorporation of the Yahoo! Groups' service terms constituted actual controls
over its member groups.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[49]</span></span></span></a>
The undisputed evidence showed that TFN's licensees were not required to adopt
the �Keep it Free, Legal, and Appropriate for all Ages� standard, nor was it
uniformly applied or interpreted by the local groups. Similarly, FS was not
required to use Yahoo! Groups and was not asked to agree to the Yahoo! Groups'
service terms as a condition of using TFN's trademarks. Moreover, the Yahoo!
Groups' service terms, which regulate generic online activity like sending spam
messages and prohibiting harassment, cannot be considered quality controls over
TFN's member groups' services and use of the trademarks. The service terms
apply to every Yahoo! Group, and do not control the quality of the freecycling
services that TFN's member groups provide. Thus, the �Keep it Free, Legal and
Appropriate for All Ages� standard and the Yahoo! Groups' service terms were
not quality controls over FS's use of the trademarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, we conclude that TFN's non-commercial
requirement says nothing about the <i>quality</i> of the services provided by
member groups and therefore does not establish a control requiring member
groups to maintain consistent quality. Thus, it is not an actual control in the
trademark context. Third, because member groups may freely adopt and adapt
TFN's listed rules of etiquette and because of the voluntary and amorphous
nature of these rules, they cannot be considered an actual control. For
example, FS modified the etiquette that was listed on TFN's website and TFN
never required FS to conform to TFN's rules of etiquette. Fourth, TFN admits
that a central premise of its �Freecycle Ethos� is local enforcement with local
variation. By definition, this standard does not maintain consistency across
member groups, so it is not an actual control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even assuming that TFN's asserted quality control
standards actually relate to the quality of its member groups' services, they
were not adequate quality controls because they were not enforced and were not
effective in maintaining the consistency of the trademarks. Indeed, TFN's
alleged quality controls fall short of the supervision and control deemed
inadequate in other cases in which summary judgment on naked licensing has been
granted to the licensee. <i>See, e.g., Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at
596&#8211;97 (finding no express contractual right to inspect and supervise the
use of the marks coupled with licensor's infrequent wine tastings and
unconfirmed reliance on the winemaker's expertise was inadequate evidence of
quality controls to survive summary judgment); <i>Stanfield,</i> 52 F.3d at 871
(granting summary judgment to the licensee where the license agreement lacked a
right to inspect or supervise licensee's operations, and alleged actual
controls were that the licensor examined one swine heating pad, looked at other
pet pads, and occasionally reviewed promotional materials and advertising).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, even if we were inclined to accept the
premise allegedly set forth in <i>Birthright,</i> that loosely organized
non-profits that share common goals are subject to less stringent quality
control requirements for trademark purposes, the result would be the same. In <i>Birthright,</i>
the court held that the license was not naked because the licensor �monitored
and controlled� its licensees' use of the trademarks. 827 F.Supp. at
1139&#8211;40; <i>see also Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at 596 (holding that a licensor
may overcome the lack of a formal agreement if it exercises actual control over
its licensees). Here, TFN exercised no actual control over its licensees, so
even under a less stringent standard, TFN has not raised a material issue of
fact as to whether it exercised actual control over FS's use of the trademarks.
<i>See Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at 598.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN contends that even if it did not exercise
actual control, it justifiably relied on its member groups' quality control
measures. Although �courts have upheld licensing agreements where the licensor
is familiar with and relies upon the licensee's own efforts to control
quality,� <i>Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at 596 (internal quotation marks and
brackets omitted), we, like the other circuits that have considered this issue,
have required that the licensor and licensee be involved in a �close working
relationship� to establish adequate quality control in the absence of a formal
agreement, <i>id.</i> at 597; <i>accord Stanfield,</i> 52 F.3d at 872; <i>Taco
Cabana Int'l, Inc. v. Two Pesos, Inc.,</i> 932 F.2d 1113, 1121 (5th Cir.1991).
In <i>Barcamerica,</i> we cited four examples of �close working relationships�
that would allow the licensor to rely on the licensee's own quality control:
(1) a close working relationship for eight years; (2) a licensor who
manufactured ninety percent of the components sold by a licensee and with whom
it had a ten year association and knew of the licensee's expertise; (3)
siblings who were former business partners and enjoyed a seventeen-year
business relationship; and (4) a licensor with a close working relationship
with the licensee's employees, and the pertinent agreement provided that the
license would terminate if certain employees ceased to be affiliated with the
licensee. 289 F.3d at 597.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, TFN and FS did not enjoy the type of close
working relationship that would permit TFN to rely on FS's quality control
measures. TFN had no long term relationship with Abraham or the FS group. In
fact, the October 9, 2003 email between Beal and Abraham, which mentions using
the TFN logo, was the parties' first and only written communication about the
trademarks prior to TFN's requests to stop using them in November 2006. In
addition, TFN had no experience with FS that might have supported its alleged
confidence in FS's quality control measures. Thus, even considered in a light
most favorable to TFN, no evidence showed the type of close working relationship
necessary to overcome TFN's lack of quality controls over FS. <i>See id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Furthermore, we have held that, while reliance on a
licensee's own quality control efforts is a relevant factor, such reliance is <i>not
alone sufficient</i> to show that a naked license has not been granted.<a
href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

Transmission Parts Corp.,</i> 768 F.2d 1001, 1017&#8211;18 (9th Cir.1985)
(noting that, although the licensor had worked closely with the licensee for
ten years, the licensor did not rely solely on his confidence in the licensee,
but exercised additional control by, <i>inter alia,</i> periodically inspecting
those goods and was consulted regarding any changes in the product). Because
sole reliance on a licensee's own control quality efforts is not enough to
overcome a finding of naked licensing without other indicia of control, <i>see
id.</i> at 1017&#8211;18, and because TFN lacked a close working relationship
with FS and failed to show any other indicia of actual control, we conclude
that TFN could not rely solely on FS's own quality control efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN's three remaining arguments also fail to raise
a material issue of fact that precludes a grant summary of judgment for FS.
First, TFN asserts that it should be subject to a lesser level of quality
control standard because its services are not dangerous to the public and the
public expects local variation in services so the probability of deception is
low. We have stated that the �standard of quality control and the degree of
necessary inspection and policing by the licensor will vary.� <i>Barcamerica,</i>
289 F.3d at 598. The licensor need only exercise �control sufficient to meet
the reasonable expectations of customers.� McCarthy, � 18:55. However, because
TFN did not establish <i>any</i> quality control requirements for its member
groups, we do not need to decide what efforts to oversee a licensee's
performance might meet a low standard of quality control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TFN's remaining two arguments&#8212;(1) that FS
must show both naked licensing <i>and</i> a loss of trademark significance, and
(2) that FS is estopped from supporting its naked licensing defense with
evidence that demonstrates that TFN did not adequately control the services
offered by FS when using the trademarks&#8212;are both raised for the first
time on appeal, so we decline to reach them. <i>See United States v. Robertson,</i>
52 F.3d 789, 791 (9th Cir.1994) (�Issues not presented to the district court
cannot generally be raised for the first time on appeal.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>IV</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We determine, viewing the record in the light most
favorable to TFN, that TFN (1) did not retain express contractual control over
FS's quality control measures, (2) did not have actual control over FS's
quality control measures, and (3) was unreasonable in relying on FS's quality
control measures. Therefore, we conclude that TFN engaged in naked licensing
and consequently abandoned the trademarks. The district court's grant of
summary judgment in favor of FS and against TFN is <span>AFFIRMED<b>.</b></span></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc392010436"><a name="_Toc371957109">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
First Sale Doctrine</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first sale doctrine has been defined as follows: </p>

<p class=Blockquote>The resale of genuine trademarked goods generally does not
constitute infringement. This is for the simple reason that consumers are not
confused as to the origin of the goods: the origin has not changed as a result
of the resale. Under what has sometimes been called the �first sale� or
�exhaustion� doctrine, the trademark protections of the Lanham Act are
exhausted after the trademark owner's first authorized sale of that product.
Therefore, even though a subsequent sale is without a trademark owner's
consent, the resale of a genuine good does not violate the [Lanham] Act. </p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>This doctrine does not hold true, however, when an
alleged infringer sells trademarked goods that are materially different than
those sold by the trademark owner�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Davidoff &amp; CIE, S.A. v. PLD Intern. Corp</i>.,
263 F.3d 1297, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;A crucial question under the first sale doctrine,
then, is what constitutes a �material difference� such that the resale of the
materially different good under the original trademark would violate the
trademark owner�s rights.&nbsp; The following two opinions address this
issue.&nbsp; The first, <i>Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders</i>, 331 U.S. 125
(1947), involving refurbished spark plugs, is one of the foundational first
sale doctrine cases in U.S. trademark law.&nbsp; The second, more recent case, <i>Nitro
Leisure Products, L.L.C. v. Acushnet Co</i>., 341 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003),
involves refurbished golf balls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the first sale doctrine is not strictly speaking a
defense to trademark infringement in which the defendant bears the burden of
persuasion.&nbsp; As <i>Nitro Leisure</i> makes clear, the plaintiff bears the
overall burden of persuading the court that consumers would be confused as to
the true nature of the goods sold by the defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Petitioner is a manufacturer of spark plugs which
it sells under the trade mark �Champion.� Respondents collect the used plugs,
repair and recondition them, and resell them. Respondents retain the word
�Champion� on the repaired or reconditioned plugs. The outside box or carton in
which the plugs are packed has stamped on it the word �Champion,� together with
the letter and figure denoting the particular style or type. They also have
printed on them �Perfect Process Spark Plugs Guaranteed Dependable� and
�Perfect Process Renewed Spark Plugs.� Each carton contains smaller boxes in
which the plugs are individually packed. These inside boxes also carry legends
indicating that the plug has been renewed.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[51]</span></span></span></a>
But respondent company's business name or address is not printed on the
cartons. It supplies customers with petitioner's charts containing
recommendations for the use of Champion plugs. On each individual plug is
stamped in small letters, blue on black, the word �Renewed,� which at time is
almost illegible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Petitioner brought this suit in the District Court,
charging infringement of its trade mark and unfair competition. <i>See</i>
Judicial Code s 24(1), (7), 28 U.S.C. s 41(1), (7), 28 U.S.C.A. s 41(1, 7). The
District Court found that respondents had infringed the trade mark. It enjoined
them from offering or selling any of petitioner's plugs which had been repaired
or reconditioned unless (a) the trade mark and type and style marks were
removed, (b) the plugs were repainted with a durable grey, brown, orange, or
green paint, (c) the word �Repaired� was stamped into the plug in letters of
such size and depth as to retain enough white paint to display distinctly each
letter of the word, (d) the cartons in which the plugs were apcked carried a
legend indicating that they contained used spark plugs originally made by
petitioner and repaired and made fit for use up to 10,000 miles by respondent
company.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span

247.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Circuit Court of Appeals held that respondents
not only had infringed petitioner's trade mark but also were guilty of unfair
competition. It likewise denied an accounting but modified the decree in the
following respects: (a) it eliminated the provision requiring the trade mark
and type and style marks to be removed from the repaired or reconditioned
plugs; (b) it substituted for the requirement that the word �Repaired� be
stamped into the plug, etc., a provision that the word �Repaired� or �Used� be
stamped and baked on the plug by an electrical hot press in a contrasting color
so as to be clearly and distinctly visible, the plug having been completely
covered by permanent aluminum paint or other paint or lacquer; and (c) it
eliminated the provision specifying the precise legend to be printed on the
cartons and substituted therefor a more general one.<a href="#_ftn53"

petition for certiorari which we granted because of the apparent conflict
between the decision below and <i>Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Reich</i>, 121

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no challenge here to the findings as to
the misleading character of the merchandising methods employed by respondents,

but have also engaged in unfair competition.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54"

The controversy here relates to the adequacy of the relief granted,
particularly the refusal of the Circuit Court of Appeals to require respondents
to remove the word �Champion� from the repaired or reconditioned plugs which
they resell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We put to one side the case of a manufacturer or
distributor who markets new or used spark plugs of one make under the trade
mark of another. <i>See Bourjois &amp; Co. v. Katzel</i>, 260 U.S. 689; O<i>ld
Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp</i>., 299 U.S. 183. Equity
then steps in to prohibit defendant's use of the mark which symbolizes
plaintiff's good will and �stakes the reputation of the plaintiff upon the
character of the goods.� <i>Bourjois &amp; Co. v. Katzel</i>, <i>supra</i>, 260
U.S. at page 692</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We are dealing here with second-hand goods. The
spark plugs, though used, are nevertheless Champion plugs and not those of another
make.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[55]</span></span></span></a>
There is evidence to support what one would suspect, that a used spark plug
which has been repaired or reconditioned does not measure up to the
specifications of a new one. But the same would be true of a second-hand Ford
or Chevrolet car. And we would not suppose that one could be enjoined from
selling a car whose valves had been reground and whose piston rings had been
replaced unless he removed the name Ford or Chevrolet. <i>Prestonettes, Inc.,
v. Coty</i>, 264 U.S. 359, was a case where toilet powders had as one of their
ingredients a powder covered by a trade mark and where perfumes which were
trade marked were rebottled and sold in smaller bottles. The Court sustained a
decree denying an injunction where the prescribed labels told the truth. Mr. Justice
Holmes stated, �A trade-mark only gives the right to prohibit the use of it so
far as to protect the owner's good will against the sale of another's product
as his. * * * When the mark is used in a way that does not deceive the public
we see no such sanctity in the word as to prevent its being used to tell the
truth. It is not taboo.� 264 U.S. at page 368.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Cases may be imagined where the reconditioning or
repair would be so extensive or so basic that it would be a misnomer to call
the article by its original name, even though the words �used� or �repaired�
were added. <i>Cf. Ingersoll v. Doyle</i>, D.C., 247 F. 620. But no such
practice is involved here. The repair or reconditioning of the plugs does not
give them a new design. It is no more than a restoration, so far as possible,
of their original condition. The type marks attached by the manufacturer are
determined by the use to which the plug is to be put. But the thread size and
size of the cylinder hole into which the plug is fitted are not affected by the
reconditioning. The heat range also has relevance to the type marks. And there
is evidence that the reconditioned plugs are inferior so far as heat range and
other qualities are concerned. But inferiority is expected in most second-hand
articles. Indeed, they generally cost the customer less. That is the case here.
Inferiority is immaterial so long as the article is clearly and distinctively
sold as repaired or reconditioned rather than as new.<a href="#_ftn56"
name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[56]</span></span></span></a> The result is, of course,
that the second-hand dealer gets some advantage from the trade mark. But under
the rule of Prestonettes, Inc., v. Coty, supra, that is wholly permissible so
long as the manufacturer is not identified with the inferior qualities of the
product resulting from wear and tear or the reconditioning by the dealer. Full
disclosure gives the manufacturer all the protection to which he is entitled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The decree as shaped by the Circuit Court of
Appeals is fashioned to serve the requirements of full disclosure. We cannot
say that of the alternatives available the ones it chose are inadequate for
that purpose. We are mindful of the fact that this case, unlike <i>Prestonettes,
Inc., v. Coty</i>, supra, involves unfair competition as well as trade mark
infringement; and that where unfair competition is established, any doubts as
to the adequacy of the relief are generally resolved against the transgressor. <i>Warner
&amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co</i>., 256 U.S. 526, 532. But there was here no
showing of fraud or palming off. Their absence, of course, does not undermine
the finding of unfair competition. F<i>ederal Trade Commission v. Winsted
Hosiery Co</i>., 258 U.S. 483, 493; <i>G. H. Mumm Champagne v. Eastern Wine
Corp</i>., 2 Cir., 142 F.2d 499, 501. But the character of the conduct giving
rise to the unfair competition is relevant to the remedy which should be
afforded. <i>See Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Commission</i>, 327 U.S.
608. We cannot say that the conduct of respondents in this case, or the nature
of the article involved and the characteristics of the merchandising methods
used to sell it, called for more stringent controls than the Circuit Court of
Appeals provided.</p>

finding damage to the plaintiff and profit to the infringer. But it does not
stand for the proposition that an accounting will be ordered merely because
there has been an infringement. Under the Trade Mark Act of 1905,<a

same is true in case of unfair competition. <i>Straus v. Notaseme Co</i>., 240
U.S. 179, 181-183. Here, as we have noted, there has been no showing of fraud
or palming off. For several years respondents apparently endeavored to comply
with a cease and desist order of the Federal Trade Commission requiring them to
place on the plugs and on the cartons a label revealing that the plugs were
used or second-hand. Moreover, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the
likelihood of damage to petitioner or profit to respondents due to any
misrepresentation seems slight. In view of these various circumstances it seems
to us that the injunction will satisfy the equities of the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Acushnet Company (�Acushnet�) appeals from the
denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction by the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida. <i>In re Nitro Leisure Prods.,
L.L.C.,</i> No. 02&#8211;14008&#8211;CV&#8211;Middlebrooks (S.D.Fla. Aug. 9,
2002) (�<i>Order</i> �). Because the district court did not abuse its
discretion in denying Acushnet's motion in view of Acushnet's failure to show a
reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its claims, we affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Acushnet manufactures and sells golfing equipment,
and in particular, golf balls. Acushnet owns and has federally registered the
trademarks TITLEIST, ACUSHNET, PINNACLE, and PRO V1. Of particular interest in
this case, Acushnet manufactures and markets new golf balls under the TITLEIST
name and trademark, including the TITLEIST PRO V1, asserted by Acushnet to be
the best selling golf ball in the United States since February 2001. <i>Order</i>
at 2&#8211;3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nitro obtains and sells two categories of used golf
balls at a discounted rate. The first category of balls are �recycled� balls.
The recycled balls are those found in relatively good condition, needing little
more than washing, and are repackaged for resale. Recycled balls represent
approximately 30% of Nitro's sales. The second category includes balls that are
found with stains, scuffs or blemishes, requiring �refurbishing.� Nitro's refurbishing
process includes cosmetically treating the balls by removing the base coat of
paint, the clear coat layer, and the trademark and model markings without
damaging the covers of the balls, and then repainting the balls, adding a clear
coat, and reaffixing the original manufacturer's trademark. Nitro also applies
directly to each �refurbished� ball the legend �USED &amp; REFURBISHED BY
SECOND CHANCE� or �USED AND REFURBISHED BY GOLFBALLSDIRECT.COM.� In these
statements, the terms �Second Chance� and �Golfballsdirect.com� refer to
businesses of Nitro. <i>Order</i> at 3. Some, but not all, of the refurbished
balls also bear a Nitro trademark. Nitro's refurbished balls are packaged in
containers displaying the following disclaimer:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>ATTENTION USED/REFURBISHED GOLF BALLS: The enclosed
contents of used/refurbished golf balls are USED GOLF BALLS. Used/Refurbished
golf balls are subject to performance variations from new ones. These
used/refurbished balls were processed via one or more of the following steps:
stripping, painting, stamping and/or clear coating in our factory. This product
has NOT been endorsed or approved by the original manufacturer and the balls DO
NOT fall under the original manufacturer's warranty.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>According to Nitro, there is a large market for used
golf balls. In 2001, Nitro saw annual sales of approximately $10 million,
including $4.8 million for refurbished balls. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nitro originally filed suit against Acushnet in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging, <i>inter
alia,</i> unfair competition. Shortly thereafter, Acushnet filed suit in the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging
that Nitro infringed a number of Acushnet's patents and violated federal and
state trademark laws. Nitro amended its complaint in the Florida case to seek a
declaratory judgment that it did not infringe Acushnet's patents. The
California action was subsequently transferred to Florida, and the actions were
consolidated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On April 23, 2002, Acushnet moved for a preliminary
injunction on its trademark and patent claims. As to the trademark claims,
Acushnet concedes that it has no trademark claim with respect to �recycled�
balls and does not object to those sales. As to the �refurbished� balls,
however, Acushnet asserts that �Nitro's refurbishing process produces a golf
ball that bears no resemblance to a genuine Acushnet product in performance, quality
or appearance� and that �Nitro's refurbishing process so alters the basic
composition of Acushnet's golf balls that �it would be a misnomer to call the
article by its original name.� � Following oral argument, the district court on
August 9, 2002, issued its <i>Order,</i> concluding that Acushnet had failed to
show a likelihood of success on the merits and denying preliminary injunctive
relief on both the trademark and the patent law claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Before this court, Acushnet seeks review of the
denial of its motion for preliminary injunction only as to its trademark
infringement and dilution claims. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ��
1292(c)(1) and 1295(a)(1).</p>

<p class=Centered>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=Centered>Standard of Review</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court generally reviews procedural matters
under the law of the regional circuit in which the district court sits. <i>See
Payless Shoesource, Inc. v. Reebok Int'l Ltd.,</i> 998 F.2d 985, 987
(Fed.Cir.1993). Additionally, we defer to the law of the regional circuit when
addressing substantive legal issues over which we do not have exclusive subject
matter jurisdiction. <i>See id.</i> In this case, we defer to the law of the
Eleventh Circuit in reviewing the district court's denial of Acushnet's motion
for preliminary injunctive relief from the alleged trademark infringement and
dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Eleventh Circuit reviews a district court's
grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <i>Davidoff
&amp; CIE, SA v. PLD Int'l Corp.,</i> 263 F.3d 1297, 1300 (11th Cir.2001); <i>McDonald's
Corp. v. Robertson,</i> 147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.1998). Under the abuse of
discretion standard, a reviewing court �must affirm unless [it] at least
determine[s] that the district court has made a �clear error of judgment,� or
has applied an incorrect legal standard.� <i>CBS Broadcasting, Inc. v. EchoStar
Commun. Corp.,</i> 265 F.3d 1193, 1200 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). A
party seeking a preliminary injunction for trademark infringement must
establish four elements: (1) that there is a substantial likelihood of success
on the merits; (2) that it would be irreparably harmed if injunctive relief
were denied; (3) that the threatened injury to the trademark owner outweighs
whatever damage the injunction may cause to the alleged infringer; and (4) that
the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest. <i>Id.</i>
It is well established in the Eleventh Circuit that �[a] preliminary injunction
is an extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant
clearly established the �burden of persuasion� as to all four elements.� <i>Davidoff,</i>
263 F.3d at 1300 (quoting <i>Siegel v. LePore,</i> 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th
Cir.2000) (en banc)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To succeed on the merits of a trademark
infringement claim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant used the mark in
commerce without its consent and �that the unauthorized use was likely to
deceive, cause confusion, or result in mistake.� <i>McDonald's Corp.,</i> 147
F.3d at 1307. The determination generally boils down to the existence of
�likelihood of confusion.� <i>AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc.,</i> 812 F.2d 1531,
1538 (11th Cir.1986).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>ANALYSIS</p>

<p class=Centered>I. Acushnet's Contentions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Acushnet argues that the district court abused its
discretion in denying its motion for preliminary injunction on the pleaded
trademark infringement issues by applying an incorrect legal standard, by
erroneously relying on a non-precedential consent judgment between Acushnet and
an unrelated third party, and by making erroneous findings of fact and
applications of law to fact, in concluding that Acushnet failed to show a
likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement and dilution
claims. Acushnet requests that this court reverse the judgment of the district
court, find that a likelihood of success on the merits has been shown, and
remand with directions to enter the sought preliminary injunction or for
further proceedings consistent with our opinion. We address each of Acushnet's
arguments in turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II. Trademark Infringement</p>

<p class=Centered>A. The Applicable Standard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Acushnet first argues that the district court
failed to apply the correct legal standard to the trademark infringement claim.
Acushnet asserts that the district court misapplied <i>Champion Spark Plug Co.
v. Sanders,</i> 331 U.S. 125 (1947), and Eleventh Circuit law by failing to
extend the �material difference� test applied in the context of altered new
goods in <i>Davidoff,</i> 263 F.3d at 1302, to the used and refurbished goods
involved in the present case. Acushnet also contends that the district court's
reliance on <i>Champion</i> was misplaced because the refurbished goods in this
case differed from the original goods not by the ordinary wear and tear
expected in used products but by the refurbishing actions taken by Nitro.
Acushnet argues that the �undisputed evidence� presented, when analyzed under
the correct legal standard, would have established the requisite likelihood of
success on the merits to warrant a preliminary injunction, and that denial of
the requested preliminary injunction was an abuse of discretion. We disagree
and find no abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To succeed in its request for a preliminary
injunction on its trademark infringement claim, Acushnet must show, <i>inter
alia,</i> a likelihood of success on the merits. This means that it must show a
likelihood of success on its claim that the sale by Nitro of its refurbished
golf balls bearing re-applied Acushnet trademarks is likely to cause confusion.
In considering this issue, the district court looked to <i>Champion</i>&#8212;clear
precedent in the used goods context&#8212;and concluded, on the record
presented at this preliminary stage, that the differences between Acushnet's
new golf balls and Nitro's refurbished golf balls were not so great as to be a
misnomer and that it was not an act of infringement, warranting preliminary
injunctive relief, for Nitro to re-apply Acushnet's trademarks to the Acushnet
balls refurbished by Nitro and to re-sell those balls in packaging identifying
them as used or refurbished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Eleventh Circuit looks to the following factors
in assessing a likelihood of confusion in trademark cases:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Type of mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Similarity of mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Similarity of the products the marks represent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Similarity of the parties' retail outlets (trade
channels) and customers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Similarity of advertising media</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. Defendant's intent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. Actual confusion</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Frehling Enters., Inc. v. Int'l Select Group, Inc.,</i>
192 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.1999); <i>cf. Lipscher v. LRP Publ'ns, Inc.,</i>
266 F.3d 1305, 1313&#8211;14 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that not all <i>Frehling</i>
factors are relevant in each case). In the present case, the dispute centers
around the differences between new and refurbished Acushnet golf balls, thus
implicating the �similarity of the products� factor. Specifically, the question
presented is the propriety of the re-application by Nitro of the Acushnet
trademark, without Acushnet's consent, to genuine Acushnet golf balls that have
been used, subjected to Nitro's refurbishing process, and then re-sold by Nitro
as refurbished balls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court assessed that question by
applying the standards applied to used and refurbished goods by the Supreme Court
in the <i>Champion</i> case. The district court cited <i>Davidoff</i> but did
not directly apply the �material differences� test articulated in that case.
Acushnet urges us to conclude that the district court erred in not recognizing
from <i>Davidoff</i> that the �material differences� standard used to assess
likelihood of confusion in the sale by unrelated parties of new, genuine
trademarked goods would also be used in the Eleventh Circuit as the standard
for assessing trademark infringement in the sale of used, genuine trademarked
goods. Acushnet argues from this that had the district court applied the <i>Davidoff</i>
test, it would have found the refurbished golf balls sold by Nitro and bearing
the Nitro re-applied Acushnet trademarks to be �materially different� from the
original trademarked goods and thus an infringement of Acushnet's trademarks,
warranting preliminary injunctive relief. Nitro argues that <i>Davidoff</i> is
simply inapplicable, and attempts to distinguish this case from <i>Davidoff,</i>
based on the fact that <i>Davidoff</i> considered new goods and because <i>Davidoff</i>
did not include disclaimers. Nitro also attempts to distinguish the cases cited
by Acushnet in support of adoption of the <i>Davidoff</i> �material
differences� standard; namely, <i>Rolex Watch USA, Inc. v. Michel,</i> 179 F.3d
704 (9th Cir.1999), <i>Rolex Watch USA, Inc. v. Meece,</i> 158 F.3d 816 (5th
Cir.1998), and <i>Intel Corp. v. Terabyte International, Inc.,</i> 6 F.3d 614
(9th Cir.1993).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under 15 U.S.C. �� 1114(1) and 1125(a)(1), any
person who uses the trademark of another, without consent, in a manner that is
likely to cause confusion, mistake, or to deceive may be liable in a civil
action for trademark infringement. <i>McDonald's Corp.,</i> 147 F.3d at 1307.
In the <i>Champion</i> case, a seminal opinion on the use of trademarks on used
goods, the accused infringer collected genuine used Champion spark plugs,
repaired and reconditioned the spark plugs, painted the spark plugs for
aesthetic reasons, and resold the spark plugs, each labeled �Renewed.� 331 U.S.
at 126. The issue before the Supreme Court was simply whether the lower courts
erred in not requiring the accused infringer to remove Champion's trademark
name from the repaired and reconditioned spark plugs. <i>Id.</i> at 128. The
Supreme Court acknowledged that, in some cases, used and repaired goods can be
sold under the trademark of the original manufacturer, without �deceiv[ing] the
public,� so long as the accused infringer had attempted to restore �so far as
possible� the original condition of the goods and full disclosure is made about
the true nature of the goods, for example, as �used� or �repaired.� <i>Id.</i>
at 129&#8211;30. In <i>Champion,</i> the Supreme Court stated that �[w]hen the
mark is used in a way that does not deceive the public we see no such sanctity
in the word as to prevent its being used to tell the truth.� <i>Id.</i> at 129.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Supreme Court recognized that this standard
results in the second-hand dealer getting some advantage from the trademark;
however, this windfall is �wholly permissible so long as the manufacturer is
not identified with the inferior qualities of the product.� <i>Id.</i> at 130
(citing <i>Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty,</i> 264 U.S. 359 (1924)). This advantage
is not inconsistent with the stated purposes of the Lanham Act. In passing the
Lanham Act, Congress noted that the purpose was �to protect legitimate business
and consumers of the country.� 92 Cong. Rec. 7524 (1946). To fulfill this
purpose, the Act �protect[s] the public so it may be confident that, in
purchasing a product bearing a particular trade-mark which it favorably knows,
it will get the product which it asks for and wants to get.� S.Rep. No.
79&#8211;1333 at 3 (1946), <i>reprinted in</i> 1946 U.S.S.C.A.N. 1274. Further,
the owner of the trademark must have the energy and effort he expended in
building goodwill in his trademark protected from misappropriation. <i>Id.</i>
However, so long as the customer is getting a product with the expected
characteristics, and so long as the goodwill built up by the trademark owner is
not eroded by being identified with inferior quality, the Lanham Act does not
prevent the truthful use of trademarks, even if such use results in the
enrichment of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Champion</i> court, while concluding that
the facts of that case did not establish a likelihood of confusion, cautioned
that there are limits on the use of a trademark by another on a used or
repaired item. The Supreme Court explained that �[c]ases may be imagined where
the reconditioning or repair would be so extensive or so basic that it would be
a misnomer to call the article by its original name, even though the words
�used� or �repaired� were added.� 331 U.S. at 129. In <i>Champion,</i> the
repair was such that it �[did] not give [the product] a new design,� and the
accused infringers had sought to restore the product �so far as possible, [to
its] original condition,� <i>id.</i> Thus, no infringement was found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Similar to the admonition expressed by the Supreme
Court in connection with the sale of refurbished goods in <i>Champion,</i> the
Eleventh Circuit in <i>Davidoff</i> cautioned that there are limits to the
permissible uses of a trademark by re-sellers even on new, genuine trademarked
goods. In <i>Davidoff,</i> the Eleventh Circuit found infringement in the use
of a trademark by a party unrelated to the trademark owner for new, genuine
trademarked goods sold in packaging that had been altered. In that case,
accused infringer PLD purchased genuine bottles of Davidoff's perfumes and,
prior to re-sale, etched and altered the bottles to remove batch code
information from the bottoms of the bottles. Davidoff sought to end this
practice, arguing that the etching of the bottles altered the product in a way
that caused consumer confusion. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, holding that the
removal of the batch code information was a material alteration that would
affect a consumer's decision whether to purchase the product in question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fundamental question examined in <i>Davidoff</i>
was the same question considered in <i>Champion</i>&#8212;likelihood of
confusion&#8212;but presented in the context of re-sales of new goods. The
context is important because consumers of new goods have different expectations
than consumers of used goods. For new goods, any variation of the product from
a new condition&#8212;even as relatively modest as the obliteration of a name
or batch number from the bottom of a container&#8212;may signal imitation,
counterfeiting, falsity or some other irregularity affecting a customer's
decision whether to purchase the product. <i>See, e.g., Societe Des Produits
Nestle S.A. v. Casa Helvetia, Inc.,</i> 982 F.2d 633, 644 (1st Cir.1992)
(finding such differences as configuration, i.e., the number of different
shapes of chocolates, and packaging, i.e., whether the packaging is shiny or
matte and the colors of the packaging, to be material). For new goods,
consumers are likely to be confused by the presence of such �material
differences.� <i>Davidoff,</i> 263 F.3d at 1302.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For used or refurbished goods, customers have a
different expectation. They do not expect the product to be in the same
condition as a new product. <i>Champion,</i> 331 U.S. at 129. There is an
understanding on the part of consumers of used or refurbished products that
such products will be degraded or will show signs of wear and tear and will not
measure up to or perform at the same level as if new. <i>Id.</i> at
129&#8211;30. For used or refurbished products, consumers are not likely to be
confused by&#8212;and indeed expect&#8212;differences in the goods compared to
new, unused goods. <i>Id.</i> Thus, the tests applied to assess likelihood of
confusion by courts will not necessarily be the same when determining trademark
infringement in the resale of altered new goods and when considering trademark
infringement in the resale of used and refurbished goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both <i>Champion</i> and <i>Davidoff</i> sought to
define the boundaries of when the use of a trademark on genuine trademarked
goods is no longer permitted. The tests applied in both cases focus on the
similarities and differences between the accused infringing goods and the genuine
trademarked goods and assess the likelihood of confusion resulting from
contemporaneous sales of those goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Davidoff</i> test looks to the effect on a
consumer's decision to purchase of differences in an altered or modified new
product from the original. It is a reasonable and workable test of the
likelihood of confusion and the loss of goodwill represented by the trademark
applied to the product, given consumer expectations as to the nature and
quality of new products as offered for sale. The test has been adopted and
applied to new, genuine trademarked goods in the First, Second, Third, Fifth,
and Ninth Circuits. <i>See, e.g., Nestle,</i> 982 F.2d at 644 (1st Cir.)
(finding material differences based on quality control, composition,
configuration, packaging, and price); <i>Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v.
Granada Elecs., Inc.,</i> 816 F.2d 68, 73 (2d Cir.1987) (finding material
differences where an imported doll comes with foreign language �adoption
papers� and is not permitted to be �adopted� domestically); <i>Iberia Foods
Corp. v. Romeo,</i> 150 F.3d 298, 302 (3d Cir.1998) (finding material
differences where quality control measures differ); <i>Martin's Herend Imports
Inc. v. Diamond &amp; Gem Trading USA, Co.,</i> 112 F.3d 1296, 1302 (5th
Cir.1997) (finding material differences when the trademark holder had chosen to
sell only selected pieces in the United States and the accused infringer was
selling other, genuine pieces in the United States); <i>Enesco Corp. v. Price/Costco
Inc.,</i> 146 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.1998) (finding material differences
where quality control measures differ).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Champion</i> Court recognizes that consumers
do not expect used or refurbished goods to be the same as new goods and that
for such goods, �material differences� do not necessarily measure consumer
confusion. According to <i>Champion,</i> what is more telling on the question
of likelihood of confusion in the context of used goods is whether the used or
refurbished goods are so different from the original that it would be a
misnomer for them to be designated by the original trademark. We see no basis
to conclude that the district court's reliance on <i>Champion</i> was improper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court in this case properly assessed
likelihood of confusion in concluding: (1) that on the evidence before it, the
differences in the goods were nothing more than what would be expected for used
golf balls; (2) that it was therefore not a misnomer to apply the Acushnet mark
to the used Acushnet balls; and (3) that Acushnet had not established a
likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark �likelihood of confusion�
case. This is all that was required, and there is no basis to conclude that the
district court applied the wrong test or otherwise abused its discretion. This
court need not predict whether the Eleventh Circuit would apply <i>Davidoff</i>
to used goods. It would only be necessary to make such a prediction if
application of the �material differences� test must be satisfied in all cases
involving genuine trademarked goods. But <i>Davidoff</i> does not go that far
and cannot be read to supplant the statutory �likelihood of confusion� test
with a �material differences� test applicable to all cases involving the resale
of genuine trademarked goods, both new and used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Alternatively, Acushnet argues that the district
court's reliance on <i>Champion</i> is misplaced.<a href="#_ftn58"
name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[58]</span></span></span></a> Acushnet attempts to
distinguish <i>Champion,</i> arguing first that Nitro does not restore �so far
as possible� the used balls to their original condition, but rather masks the
balls' condition, and second, that by masking rather than restoring, Nitro
makes it more likely that customers will associate inferior performance with
Acushnet. Acushnet argues that, although there was repainting of the spark
plugs in <i>Champion,</i> such painting was merely cosmetic. Acushnet contends
that the district court failed to recognize that Nitro's process of stripping
and repainting was more than cosmetic and changed the fundamental attributes of
the reprocessed balls. Moreover, Acushnet argues that it is Nitro's
refurbishing process, not normal wear and tear, that degraded the quality of
Nitro's used golf balls. Acushnet thus asserts that <i>Champion</i> is
distinguishable on its facts and should not apply. We disagree with Acushnet's
distinctions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, while it is true that the spark plugs were
repainted in <i>Champion,</i> the reconditioning also involved removing burned
and pitted portions of the center electrodes, welding new metal to the side
electrodes, wearing away the plug's porcelain insulators through sandblasting,
and then cleaning and painting the spark plug. <i>Champion Spark Plug Co. v.
Sanders,</i> 156 F.2d 488, 489 (2d Cir.1946). The refurbishing process in <i>Champion,</i>
then, was not merely cosmetic, and cannot be distinguished from the present
case on that basis. Second, <i>Champion</i> also held that the source of any
inferiority, whether the reconditioning or the refurbishing, is irrelevant,
stating that inferiority is immaterial as long as the original manufacturer �is
not identified with the inferior qualities of the product <i>resulting from
wear and tear or the reconditioning.</i>� <i>Champion,</i> 331 U.S. at 130 (emphasis
added). In the <i>Champion</i> case, the district court noted that there was no
proof whether the inferior qualities stemmed from either �wear and tear prior
to the discarding of the plug by the original user, or to the process of repair
as conducted by the defendants.� <i>Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders,</i> 61
F.Supp. 247, 248&#8211;49 (E.D.N.Y.1945). Acushnet's distinction on this point
is similarly untenable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, the district court carefully
considered the extent of the alterations made by Nitro. <i>See Order</i> at
8&#8211;9 (citing <i>Rolex Watch USA, Inc. v. Michel,</i> 179 F.3d 704)
(�[w]hether the modifications made to the product resulted in a new product�); <i>Intel,</i>
6 F.3d at 619. The district court also looked to a number of factors, outlined
by the Ninth Circuit, to determine if the alterations resulted in a new
product. <i>Order</i> at 9 (�These factors �include the nature and extent of
the alterations, the nature of the device and how it is designed ..., whether a
market has developed for service or spare parts ... and, most importantly,
whether end users of the product are likely to be misled as to the party
responsible for the composition of the product.� <i>Karl Storz
Endoscopy&#8211;America, Inc. v. Surgical Technologies, Inc.,</i> 285 F.3d 848,
856&#8211;57 (9th Cir.2002).� (alterations in original)). The district court
also considered: (a) evidence proffered by Nitro that the performance differences
were not as extensive as claimed by Acushnet; (b) evidence of the use of
disclaimers; and (c) evidence from customers of both Acushnet and Nitro on the
question of confusion. <i>Order</i> at 9&#8211;12. On this record, the district
court concluded that �Acushnet has not presented sufficient evidence to support
its claim that the golf balls are so extensively repaired that they cannot be
truly labeled with the Titleist marks.� <i>Id.</i> at 9&#8211;10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the district court properly considered the <i>Frehling</i>
factors; fully and carefully assessed the differences between Acushnet's new
golf balls and Nitro's refurbished golf balls in determining likelihood of
confusion; and correctly looked to <i>Champion</i> for the applicable legal
standard, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of
Acushnet's requested preliminary injunction based on its trademark infringement
claim.</p>

<p class=Centered>III. Dilution</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Acushnet also appeals the district court's denial
of the motion for preliminary injunction on its dilution claim. The district
court determined that Acushnet's marks are famous, indicating that there �is no
dispute concerning the strength of Acushnet's trademarks.� <i>Order</i> at 7.
The district court, however, did not find Acushnet's evidence and legal
arguments to be sufficient to establish that Nitro was lessening the capacity
of Acushnet's trademarks to serve as source indicators and damaging Acushnet's
business reputation and goodwill. <i>Id.</i> at 14. This outcome is consistent
with the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc.,</i>
537 U.S. 418 (2003), issued during the pendency of this case before our court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Moseley,</i> the lingerie retailer,
VICTORIA'S SECRET, sued Victor and Cathy Moseley, proprietors of a store named
�Victor's Little Secret,� for trademark dilution, among other claims. The
Moseleys sold, through the store, �a wide variety of items, including adult
videos, �adult novelties,� and lingerie.� 123 S.Ct. at 1120. The district court
found that the Moseleys did not challenge the claim that the mark VICTORIA'S
SECRET was famous, and found dilution based on tarnishment. <i>Id.</i> The
Sixth Circuit affirmed, basing its determination of dilution on both
tarnishment and blurring. <i>Id.</i> at 1120&#8211;21. The Supreme Court,
however, reversed, holding that the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1127, �unambiguously requires a showing of actual dilution, rather than a
likelihood of dilution.� 123 S.Ct. at 1124. Because, in the <i>Moseley</i>
case, there was �a complete absence of evidence of any lessening of the
capacity of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark to identify and distinguish goods or
services sold in Victoria's Secret stores or advertised in its catalogs,� the
Court reversed the Sixth Circuit Court's finding of dilution. <i>Id.</i> at
1125.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In arguing the dilution claim before us, Acushnet
reiterates the conclusory statements it made before the district court, with
little more. These arguments fail to establish that the district court erred or
abused its discretion. Moreover, we find no basis to conclude that Acushnet
meets the requirement of �a showing of actual dilution� under <i>Moseley.</i>
Therefore, we affirm the district court's denial of the requested preliminary
injunction based on trademark dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>CONCLUSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court did not abuse its discretion,
commit an error of law, or seriously misjudge the evidence in concluding that
Acushnet failed to show a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its
trademark and dilution claims and in denying Acushnet's motion for a preliminary
injunction based thereon. We therefore affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>PAULINE NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> I can think of nothing more destructive of the
value of a famous trademark than for the law to permit unauthorized persons to
re-affix the mark to a product that is so badly cut, scarred, dented,
discolored, and bruised that its defects have to be concealed before it can be
resold as �used�&#8212;and then, with the scars hidden and the surface
repainted to look new, the product is resold with the benefit of the re-affixed
trademark and its reputation for quality and performance. The court today holds
that the trademark owner cannot object to this unauthorized, uncontrolled
affixation of its famous Titleist7 mark, provided that the package is labeled
�used/refurbished� and a disclaimer is presented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Neither trademark law nor any other law removes
from the trademark owner control of the quality of the goods and use of the
mark. To the contrary, the law requires the holder of the trademark to control
both the use of the mark and the quality of the goods to which it is affixed,
on pain of losing the mark as a trademark. The consequence of this law is that,
whether on grounds of infringement, dilution, or tarnishment, Acushnet is
likely to succeed on the merits of its case. From the denial of the requested
preliminary injunction I must, respectfully, dissent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case does not relate to the resale of used
golf balls, washed and buffed and repackaged, bearing the original trademark.
Acushnet is not objecting to that part of Nitro's activities. However, when the
balls are so badly scarred or cut that they must be repainted and the damage
concealed, the repainting also obscuring the original trademark, surely the
trademark owner has the right to prevent re-application of its trademark (in
identical script) to damaged goods covered with shiny new paint, goods of
unsupervised quality but bearing the famous original trademark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Trademark law requires that the trademark owner
police the quality of the goods to which the mark is applied, on pain of losing
the mark entirely. Professor McCarthy explains:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Sometimes a mark becomes abandoned to generic usage as a
result of the trademark owner's failure to police the mark, so that widespread
usage by competitors leads to a generic usage among the relevant public, who
see many sellers using the same word or designation.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>J. Thomas McCarthy et al., 2 <i>McCarthy on Trademarks
and Unfair Competition</i> � 17:8, at 17&#8211;10 (4th ed., Rel.# 21, 3/2002).
Yet here the trademark applier is unlicensed, the quality out of the control of
the owner of the mark, and the flaws concealed from the consumer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These are fundamental principles of trademark law.
The Federal Circuit, applying this law, has itself imposed loss of trademark
rights based on inadequate control of use of a mark by others. <i>See BellSouth
Corp. v. DataNational Corp.,</i> 60 F.3d 1565, 35 USPQ2d 1554 (Fed.Cir.1995)
(the �Walking Fingers� mark became generic because AT &amp; T allowed others to
use it). Although the law permits resale of used and refurbished products, it
does not require the owner of the trademark to permit its use on inferior goods
with concealed damage, simply by marking the goods as �used/refurbished.� The
presence of a famous trademark on such goods is not an indication of origin and
quality, but a trap for the consumer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A trademark serves as an assurance of quality,
consistency, and reliability, by indicating the source and control of the
product bearing the mark:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>However, the quality function [of a trademark] does not
replace the source function: it stands alongside it. In fact, one could
accurately state that the quality theory is merely a facet of the older source
theory. That is, the source theory has been broadened to include not only
manufacturing source but also the source of standards of quality of goods
bearing the mark: �[A] mark primarily functions to indicate a single quality
control source of the goods or services.� Under both the source and quality
rationales, unity of source of manufacture or control appears essential.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1 <i>McCarthy, supra,</i> � 3:10, at 3&#8211;20. The
law both permits and requires control by the trademark owner, even when the
mark is licensed:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Licensing a mark without adequate control over the quality
of goods or services sold under the mark by the licensee may cause the mark to
lose its significance as a symbol of equal quality-hence, abandonment.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.,</i> � 17:6, at 17&#8211;9.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> I repeat, the question is not whether Nitro can
resell used golf balls, perhaps washed and buffed; the question is whether the
owner of the Titleist7 and other famous trademarks can prevent reapplication of
these trademarks to goods that have been materially changed. In explaining
Nitro's operations, its President stated:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The balls that are in sufficiently good condition to resell
without refurbishing are then identified. Those golf balls are re-packaged and
resold as used golf balls, i.e., �recycled� golf balls.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Acushnet does not object to Nitro's resale of these
balls with the original trademarks. This case is about the next group, as
Nitro's president further explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The remaining balls, which suffer from one or more of the
following detriments, e.g., scuff marks, cart path marks, tree marks, lack of
clear coat, discoloration, etc., are sent to the final quality control sort....
The balls are refurbished by removing the base paint coat and the clear coat
from the balls, which also has the effect of removing the marking from the
balls....</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Nitro then reapplies the base coat paint (on those
balls that originally had a base coat). The balls are then re-stamped with the
appropriate markings.... Nitro re-stamps the precise model type only for those
models that its consumers have expressed a demand, e.g., Titleist Pro V1's....
Following the re-stamping process, Nitro re-applies the clear coat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court found Nitro's process not to be
�intrusive,� in that it �does not remove the dimples on the balls, nor does it
take off the cover of the ball.� The issue, however, is Nitro's right to
re-apply the Titleist7 and Pro V&#8211;17 trademarks to the repainted balls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When goods have lost their identity and their
quality, the trademark owner can not be forced to permit re-application of the
original trademark to the doctored product. That is a reproach to the most fundamental
principles of trademark law. <i>See Bulova Watch Co. v. Allerton Co.,</i> 328
F.2d 20, 24 (7th Cir.1964) (�substitution of a different crown and case by
defendants results in a different product,� enjoining use of the trademark
�Bulova� on the re-cased watches).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There was evidence that these damaged balls did not
have the characteristics of the original. Although Nitro argues that the
difference is not great, that is not the issue. Trademarks are an indication of
quality, on which the consumer can rely. The consumer is no less deceived if he
does not know that the product is inferior, or if the extent of the inferiority
is not great. The trademark owner is entitled, and required, to control the quality
of the product:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>One of the most valuable and important protections afforded
by the Lanham Act is the right to control the quality of the goods manufactured
and sold under the holder's trademark.... For this purpose the actual quality
of the goods is irrelevant: it is the control of quality that a trademark
holder is entitled to maintain.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>El Greco Leather Products Co. v. Shoe World, Inc.,</i>
806 F.2d 392, 395 (2nd Cir.1986).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if the consumer has digested the notice on the
Nitro package,<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[59]</span></span></span></a>
the severity of the concealed defects are not known to the consumer, who will
not know whether the refurbished ball has been stripped and painted, whether
the balance is distorted, whether the all-important dimples are encumbered with
fresh paint. The consumer will not know that the Titleist7 mark was re-applied
to a ball that was so badly damaged that the original marking was lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although there was discussion at trial of the
issues of section 1114 and section 1125 of the Trademark Act, there is prima
facie infringement when a trademark is applied by unauthorized persons to an
unlicensed product that has not met the quality standards of the trademark
under the control of the owner of the mark. The law protects not only the
trademark owner but also the consumer, for not only does an inferior product
injure the Titleist7 and Pro V&#8211;1 7 reputation, but the consumer is
deprived of the quality that the law demands of the trademark owner. Acushnet
argues, with cogency, that inferior performance is more likely to be attributed
to the Titleist7 source than to the refurbisher, for the degree of
�refurbishment� is not specified, and the balls as repainted are clean and
conceal their defects. This is not the same situation as in <i>Champion Spark
Plug v. Sanders,</i> 331 U.S. 125 (1947), where the Court ratified the resale
of used spark plugs still bearing the Champion name. The Court recognized that
the trademark had been infringed, and that the issue was adequacy of the
notice, considering �the equities of the case.� In <i>Champion</i> there was no
issue of concealed defects; the Court permitted retention of the identity of
the original plugs �so long as the manufacturer is not identified with the
inferior qualities of the product resulting from wear and tear or the
reconditioning by the dealer.� <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> My colleagues err in their ruling that the notice
that the balls are used/refurbished �protects the public so it may be confident
that, in purchasing a product bearing a particular trademark which it favorably
knows, it will get the product which it asks for and wants to get.� Maj. op. at
9. When the defects are concealed, that is not �full disclosure about the true
nature� of the golf balls as the panel majority holds. Concealment is the
antithesis of full disclosure. In purchasing a used golf ball that has been
repainted, the consumer is not provided with knowledge of concealed damage as
well as surface changes. When the consumer purchases a used golf ball bearing
the Titleist7 mark, the purchaser does not know if this is an almost-new golf
ball that went from tee to lake on the first stroke, or a ball so badly cut
that it was discarded. This is not the �full disclosure� accommodated by <i>Champion.</i>
The owner of the Titleist7 mark is surely entitled to prevent re-application of
the mark to golf balls whose repainting covers the original mark.<a
href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[60]</span></span></span></a> The Court in <i>Champion</i>
held that �the nature of the article involved and the characteristics of the
merchandising methods used to sell it� are important considerations in devising
an appropriate notice and disclaimer. 331 U.S. at 130&#8211;31. The nature of
the refurbishment of a used spark plug is visible; the nature of the damage to
a repainted golf ball is invisible, and any performance-deteriorating defects
are permanently removed from view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In an ever more complex commercial economy, it is
increasingly important to preserve standards of quality and confidence.
Trademark law carries this burden. The record states that the Titleist7 balls
are the premium balls in this market, and are recognized by the golfing public
as of high and consistent quality and dependability. The producer of these
products is entitled by law to protect the reputation and the value of its
marks. Consumer expectations of quality should not be thwarted by an
inappropriate balance of interests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A trademark owner has the absolute right to prevent
others from affixing the mark with neither license nor quality control by the
trademark owner. This is not a case of likelihood of confusion or dilution
through the use of similar marks; it is a case of unauthorized use of an
original mark on goods that have been invisibly altered, such that the use
approaches the counterfeit. The re-application of the obliterated trademark is
not simply information about the original source of used golf balls; it is an
unauthorized exploitation of the mark, identifying the original manufacturer
with the disguised product. The role of the trademark is its assurance of
quality, and its value depends on the consistent quality of the product that
bears the mark. Again quoting Professor McCarthy:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[T]he chief function of a trademark is a kind of �warranty�
to purchasers that they will receive, when they purchase goods bearing the
mark, goods of the same character and source, anonymous as it may be, as other
goods previously purchased bearing the mark that have already given the
purchaser satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The trademark owner is required by law to police
and preserve that quality; it cannot be deprived of that right and obligation.
From the panel majority's contrary ruling and denial of the requested
injunction I must, respectfully, dissent.</p>

The record indicates that on remand the courts should direct their attention in
particular to certain factual issues bearing on the fair use defense, properly
applied. The District Court said that Lasting�s motion for summary adjudication
conceded that KP used �microcolor� descriptively and not as a mark. Case No. SA
CV 00&#8211;276&#8211;GLT (EEx), at 8, App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. We think it
is arguable that Lasting made those concessions only as to KP�s use of �microcolor�
on bottles and flyers in the early 1990�s, not as to the stylized version of
�microcolor� that appeared in KP�s 1999 brochure. See Opposition to Motion for

being �Oprah� spelled backwards. Another, unrelated defendant is Chico's FAS,
Inc., the owner of several brands of clothing. Thus the oddity: Two of
defendants have the same name as two of the three Marx Brothers.</p>

Another way to understand the phrase as used by both the plaintiff and the
defendants is in less concrete terms: �to possess psychologically,� or �to
integrate the power you have into your sense of yourself.� In any event, and
under any such approach, the term is used similarly by the parties and is
sharply distinguishable from �own� in its traditional sense.</p>

We have defined �descriptive sense� in arguably more capacious terms than our
sister circuits. A hint as to the breadth of our rule lies in our discussion in
<i>Cosmetically Sealed.</i> There, we read a prior case, <i>Car&#8211;Freshner
Corp. v. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.,</i> 70 F.3d 267, 270 (2d Cir.1995), as
having concluded that the pine-tree shape of a car freshener&#8212;a
�description (by the <i>suggestive use</i> of the image) of the period in which
the product was sold�&#8212;was �a description of the goods within the meaning
of the fair use defense.� 125 F.3d at 30 (emphasis added)(internal quotation
marks omitted).</p>

I do think it worth noting that this �collective use� theory is in some tension
with <i>JA Apparel</i> 's call for individualized consideration of each
particular use. <i>See JA Apparel,</i> 568 F.3d at 402. I note also that the
principal authorities the majority cites in support of it are drawn from an
entirely different context&#8212;the protectability of a mark as a function of
its value as an identifier of source. <i>Ante</i> at 309&#8211;10. So although
it may be true that the concept is helpful at this stage, when our only task is
to identify factual plausibility, I would caution against reading the majority
opinion to mean that in all cases and at all stages of litigation unique uses
are to be considered �collectively.�</p>

This is no less true where, as here, �the defendant�s ultimate goal is to
describe his own product.� <i>Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co.,</i> 292 F.3d 1139,
1151 (9th Cir.2002) (emphasis omitted). In <i>Welles,</i> for instance, we
applied our nominative fair use analysis to a former playmate�s use of the
Playboy mark to describe herself and her website. 279 F.3d at 801. We observed
that, in those circumstances, �application of the <i>Sleekcraft</i> test, which
focuses on the similarity of the mark used by the plaintiff and the defendant,
would lead to the incorrect conclusion that virtually all nominative uses are
confusing.� <i>Id.</i></p>

The Sixth Circuit enjoined a domain name in part because it did �not include
words like �independent� or �unaffiliated,� � but in that case there were
additional factors indicating sponsorship or endorsement, including the use of
stylized versions of the plaintiff�s marks on the site. <i>PACCAR Inc. v.
TeleScan Techs., L.L.C.,</i> 319 F.3d 243, 256&#8211;57 (6th Cir. 2003). Where
these or other factors suggest that nominative use is likely to cause
confusion, a disclaimer may well be necessary. But a disclaimer is not required
every time a URL contains a mark.</p>

Of course, not every trademark.com domain name is likely to cause consumer
confusion. <i>See Interstellar Starship,</i> 304 F.3d at 944&#8211;46. For
instance, we observed in <i>Interstellar Starship</i> that an apple orchard
could operate at the website apple.com without risking confusion with Apple
Computers, in light of the vast difference between their products. <i>Id.</i>
at 944. �If, however, the apple grower ... competed directly with Apple
Computer by selling computers, initial interest confusion probably would
result,� as the apple grower would be using the apple.com domain to appropriate
the goodwill Apple Computer had developed in its trademark. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>When a website deals in goods or services related to a
trademarked brand, as in this case, it is much closer to the second example,
where apple.com competes with Apple Computers. If a company that repaired
iPods, iPads and iPhones were to set up at apple.com, for instance, consumers
would naturally assume that the company was sponsored or endorsed by Apple (or,
more likely, that it <i>was</i> Apple). Where a site is used to sell goods or
services related to the trademarked brand, a trademark.com domain will
therefore suggest sponsorship or endorsement and will not generally be
nominative fair use.</p>

Citing our refusal to distinguish between �Golden Door,� a spa, and a competing
�Golden Door for Hair,� the district court treated buyorleaselexus.com as
legally indistinguishable from lexus.com. <i>Golden Door, Inc. v. Odisho,</i>
646 F.2d 347, 350 (9th Cir.1980); <i>see also PACCAR Inc.,</i> 319 F.3d at 252.
According to Toyota, such �legally identical� phrases in a domain name can
never be fair use. But there is no such rule; we look to context to determine
how much weight to give the words accompanying a mark. <i>See, e.g., Brother Records,
Inc. v. Jardine,</i> 318 F.3d 900, 908 (9th Cir.2003). In <i>Golden Door,</i>
we noted that the defendant answered the phone �Golden Door,� not �Golden Door
for Hair,� and featured the words �Golden Door� prominently in its signs. 646
F.2d at 350.</p>

Domain names containing trademarks may also be prohibited because they dilute
the value of those marks&#8212;for instance, by creating negative associations
with the brand. <i>Cf. Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Netscape Commc�ns Corp.,</i>
354 F.3d 1020, 1033 (9th Cir.2004). For example, the website People of Walmart,
which publishes rude photos of Walmart shoppers at peopleofwalmart.com, might
dilute the Walmart trademark by associating it with violations of customers�
privacy and the idea that a visitor to Walmart stores risks being photographed
and ridiculed on the internet. <i>See</i> Jeffrey Zaslow, <i>Surviving the Age
of Humiliation,</i> Wall St. J., May 5, 2010, at D1. But Toyota does not allege
that the Tabaris� site has any such effect.</p>

The Seventh Circuit has similarly upheld the right of a seller of Beanie Babies
to operate at �bargainbeanies.com� on the grounds that �[y]ou can�t sell a
branded product without using its brand name.� <i>Ty Inc.,</i> 306 F.3d at 512.
In a prophetic choice of examples, Judge Posner remarked that prohibiting such
a domain name �would amount to saying that if a used car dealer truthfully
advertised that it sold Toyotas, or if a muffler manufacturer truthfully
advertised that it specialized in making mufflers for installation in Toyotas,
Toyota would have a claim of trademark infringement.� <i>Id.</i></p>

doesn�t suggest that the Tabaris used the Lexus mark to refer to those other

those cars. <i>See, e.g., Nissan Motor Co. v. Nissan Computer Corp.,</i> 378
F.3d 1002, 1019 (9th Cir.2004). Everyone seems to concede the Tabaris are bona
fide Lexus brokers. We therefore do not consider whether the Tabaris used the
Lexus mark in conjunction with brokering vehicles other than Lexus, or whether
such use would be infringing.</p>

This is necessarily so because, unlike classic fair use, nominative fair use is
not specifically provided for by statute. A court may find classic fair use
despite �proof of infringement� because the Lanham Act authorizes that result. <i>See</i>
15 U.S.C. � 1115(b)(4). Nominative fair use, on the other hand, represents a
finding of no liability under that statute�s basic prohibition of infringing
use. <i>See id.</i> � 1114.</p>

We take this argument to be that Haute Diggity Dog is copying too closely the
marks and trade dress of LVM. But we reject the statement that LVM has a
trademark consisting of the one word VUITTON. At oral argument, counsel for LVM
conceded that the trademark is �LOUIS VUITTON,� and it is always used in that
manner rather than simply as �VUITTON.� It appears that LVM has employed this
technique to provide a more narrow, but irrelevant, comparison between its
VUITTON and Haute Diggity Dog's �Vuiton.� In resolving this case, however, we
take LVM's arguments to compare �LOUIS VUITTON� with Haute Diggity Dog's �Chewy
Vuiton.�</p>

which added a �dilution� cause of action to � 43 of the Lanham Act. When the

We emphasize that this appeal relates only to Brown's Lanham Act claim. Were

Brown points to several examples of courts suggesting that certain video games
may not warrant First Amendment protection as expressive works, but all of the
cases cited were decided years before the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <i>Brown
v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n,</i> &#8211;&#8211;&#8211; U.S.
&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011). <i>See
Am. Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Kendrick,</i> 244 F.3d 572, 579&#8211;80 (7th
Cir.2001); <i>Wilson v. Midway Games, Inc.,</i> 198 F.Supp.2d 167, 180&#8211;81
(D.Conn.2002); <i>Am.'s Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York,</i>
536 F.Supp. 170, 173&#8211;74 (E.D.N.Y.1982). Brown argues that EA's insistence
that the <i>Rogers</i> test governs is an attempt to portray First Amendment
law as settled with regard to video games when it is in fact evolving, but <i>Brown
v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n</i> demonstrates that any evolution favors
greater protection, a fact Brown ignores by emphasizing these earlier cases.
This evolution in recent years toward greater First Amendment protection for
non-traditional media has not been limited to video games. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <i>Anderson
v. City of Hermosa Beach,</i> 621 F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir.2010) (holding that
�tattooing is a purely expressive activity fully protected by the First

In addition to pointing us to <i>Parks,</i> Brown also analogizes his case to <i>American
Dairy Queen Corp. v. New Line Productions, Inc.,</i> 35 F.Supp.2d 727
(D.Minn.1998), in which the defendant admitted in its briefing that it did not
intend its �Dairy Queens� title to refer to plaintiff American Dairy Queen
Corporation. Based on this admission, the district court found that the
defendant could express its ideas in other ways, and thus that on balance the
risk of consumer confusion and trademark dilution outweighed the public
interest in free expression. <i>Id.</i> at 734&#8211;35. As explained in our
discussion of <i>Parks,</i> this analogy is inapt because there is no similar
explicit denial of relevance in this case, and because we presume the truth of
Brown's allegations that EA has used his likeness. <i>American Dairy Queen</i>
also was not a case involving application of the <i>Rogers</i> test.</p>

Brown argues that a similar statement appearing on the packaging of the 2007
and 2009 versions of <i>Madden NFL</i> could explicitly mislead consumers as to
Brown's endorsement. The packaging has the logo for the NFL Players Association
and says �Officially Licensed Product of NFL PLAYERS.� NFL PLAYERS is the
licensing arm of the NFLPA and manages licensing rights for both current
players and retired players, so Brown contends that the statement on the
packaging could be understood by consumers to mean that retired players,
including Brown, endorse the game. We decline to address this argument because
Brown did not raise it in his opening brief. <i>See Friends of Yosemite Valley
v. Kempthorne,</i> 520 F.3d 1024, 1033 (9th Cir.2008). For the same reason, we
decline to address Brown's contention that EA explicitly misled consumers by
using Brown's likeness on the back covers of the same two versions of the game.</p>

The district court properly considered the versions of <i>Madden NFL</i>
submitted to the court as part of the complaint itself through the
�incorporation by reference� doctrine. <i>See Knievel v. ESPN,</i> 393 F.3d
1068, 1076 (9th Cir.2005). We do the same.</p>

Although we have not previously stated specifically that a mark holder's intent
to resume use of the mark must be formulated during the three-year period of
non-use, we do so now, noting that two other circuit courts have also reached
this conclusion. <i>See, e.g., Imperial Tobacco, Ltd. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i>
899 F.2d at 1580&#8211;81 [Fed. Cir.] (expressly recognizing that intent must
be formulated during non-use period); <i>Emergency One, Inc. v. American
FireEagle, Ltd.,</i> 228 F.3d at 537 [4th Cir.] (same). Indeed, we think this
conclusion follows naturally from the fact that an abandoned mark may be
appropriated for use by other actors in the marketplace. An intent to resume
use of the mark formulated after more than three years of non-use cannot be
invoked to dislodge the rights of another party who has commenced use of a
mark&#8212;thereby acquiring priority rights in that mark&#8212;after three
years of non-use. We do not, however, foreclose the use of evidence arising
after the relevant three-year period to demonstrate an intent <i>within</i>
that period to resume use.</p>

The two factors identified in <i>Silverman</i> are not distinct but
intertwined. A mark owner's reason for suspending use of a mark is relevant to
abandonment analysis only as circumstantial evidence shedding possible light on
his intent to resume future use within a reasonable period of time. In short,
not every �reasonable suspension� will necessarily rebut a presumption of
abandonment. <i>See Silverman v. CBS, Inc.,</i> 870 F.2d at 47 (observing that
�however laudable one might think CBS's motives to be, such motives cannot
overcome the undisputed fact that CBS has not used its mark for more than 20
years and that, even now, it has no plans to resume [its] use in the reasonably
foreseeable future,� and further noting that �we see nothing in the statute
that makes the consequence of an intent not to resume use turn on the
worthiness of the motive for holding such intent�).</p>

We do not decide whether such allegations, if supported by evidence, would
permit any inference of ITC's intent to resume use of the Bukhara mark for

no means obvious.</p>

Indeed, there is no reason to think plaintiffs could make such a showing with
respect to the New York hospitality market, which experienced considerable
growth during the period 1997&#8211;2000. <i>See</i> John Holusha, �Commercial
Property; An Up Cycle Just Keeps Rolling,� <i>The New York Times</i> 11:1
(Sept. 24, 2000) (noting historically high occupancy rates in city hotels with
13% growth in first half of year); cf. Marian Burros, �Waiter, Hold the Foie
Gras: Slump Hits New York Dining,� <i>The New York Times</i> A:1 (Sept. 4,
2001) (noting, in 2001, first signs of decline in city's 10&#8211;year

Naked licensing occurs when a licensor does not exercise adequate quality
control over its licensee's use of a licensed trademark such that the trademark
may no longer represent the quality of the product or service the consumer has
come to expect. <i>See Barcamerica Int'l USA Trust v. Tyfield Importers, Inc.,</i>
289 F.3d 589, 595&#8211;96 (9th Cir.2002). By not enforcing the terms of the
trademark's use, the licensor may forfeit his rights to enforce the exclusive
nature of the trademark. The key question is therefore whether TFN produced any
evidence to raise a material fact issue as to whether it: (1) retained
contractual rights to control the quality of the use of its trademark; (2)
actually controlled the quality of the trademark's use; or (3) reasonably
relied on FS to maintain the quality. <i>Barcamerica,</i> 289 F.3d at
596&#8211;98 (upholding trademarks where a licensor is familiar with the
licensee and reasonably relies on the licensee's own quality control efforts).</p>

In general, online discussion groups such as Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups
allow individuals with a shared common interest to communicate by means of
posting messages to the particular group's online forum. Such groups may be
subject to terms and conditions of the service provider. In addition,
discussion groups often have volunteer group moderators who monitor the
discussions, and each group may adopt and enforce rules and regulations (e.g.,
discussion etiquette) separate from whatever terms the online service provider
imposes.</p>

Notably, Beal did not propose, and the modsquad did not adopt, this standard
until January 2004, more than three months after Abraham founded FS in October
2003. The only standard listed in TFN's etiquette section on its website in
2003 was �Keep it Free,� but there was no requirement that member groups adopt
this standard. Similarly, TFN's incorporation of the Yahoo! Groups' service
terms was not done until after FS was given use of the trademarks in October
2003. Because we hold that TFN did not exercise actual control no matter what
time period is considered, we do not address whether actual supervision would
be sufficient if it starts at some point after the granting of a license to use
a trademark.</p>

Other circuits have also relied on the licensor's confidence in the licensee
only where there were additional indicia of control. <i>See, e.g., Stanfield,</i>

special relationship between the parties existed and no evidence of actual
control over the licensee existed); <i>Land O'Lakes Creameries, Inc. v.

simply reselling versus reapplication of trademarks. <i>See</i> Dissent, <i>infra</i>
at 1369 (stating that the <i>Champion</i> Court �ratified the resale of used

overlooks the fact that the refurbisher in Champion, at the very least, applied
