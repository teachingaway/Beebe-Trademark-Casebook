<h2><a name="_Toc392010848">A.      Injunctive Relief</a></h2>

<p class=OpinionCitation>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote><b>Lanham Act § 34(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1116(a)</b></p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>The several courts vested with jurisdiction of civil
actions arising under this chapter shall have power to grant injunctions,
according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court may deem
reasonable, to prevent the violation of any right of the registrant of a mark
registered in the Patent and Trademark Office or to prevent a violation under
subsection (a), (c), or (d) of section 1125 of this title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The primary remedy that most trademark and false advertising
plaintiffs seek is injunctive relief, often in the form of a preliminary
injunction.  Though the circuits’ criteria for a preliminary (or permanent)
injunction vary somewhat, most circuits have traditionally required the
plaintiff to show: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood
of irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction, (3) that the balance of the
hardships tip in the movant’s favor, and (4) that the injunction would not be
adverse to the public interest.  The Second Circuit, by contrast, has
formulated a different test: “A party seeking a preliminary injunction must
establish (1) irreparable harm and (2) either (a) a likelihood of success on
the merits or (b) a sufficiently serious question going to the merits and a
balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the moving party's favor.” <i>Brennan's,
Inc. v. Brennan's Rest., L.L.C</i>., 360 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2004).  (As we
will see below, however, at least one district court in the Second Circuit has
formulated a revised test in light of the Second Circuit copyright case <i>Salinger
v. Colting</i>, 607 F.3d 68 (2d Cir.2010)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most circuits have traditionally held that a showing of a likelihood
of confusion triggers a presumption of irreparable harm.  <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Federal
Exp. Corp. v. Federal Espresso, Inc</i>., 201 F.3d 168, 174 (2d Cir. 2000)
(“[P]roof of a likelihood of confusion would create a presumption of
irreparable harm, and thus a plaintiff would not need to prove such harm independently”);
<i>GoTo.com, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co</i>., 202 F.3d 1199, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000)
(“From our analysis of the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors, we conclude that GoTo has
demonstrated a likelihood of success on its claim that Disney's use of its logo
violates the Lanham Act. From this showing of likelihood of success on the
merits in this trademark infringement claim, we may presume irreparable
injury.”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, as the following two opinions show, the Supreme
Court’s decision in <i>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC</i>, 547 U.S. 388 (2006),
has significantly complicated this line of doctrine.</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>522 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 2008)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> [Plaintiff] NAM designs and manufacturers
physiotherapeutic spinal devices, commonly known as traction devices, which are
used, for example, to treat lower back pain. Adagen is an authorized
distributor of NAM’s devices. Axiom, a competitor of NAM’s, manufacturers a physiotherapeutic
device known generally as the DRX 9000….  In the present lawsuit, NAM and
Adagen allege that Axiom engaged in unfair competition by infringing NAM’s
trademarks and by issuing false advertising regarding the DRX 9000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The trademark infringement claims stem from Axiom’s
use of two of NAM’s registered trademarks: the terms “Accu&#8211;Spina” and
“IDD Therapy.” Axiom included these terms on its website within meta tags.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B00222015725149_ID0"></a><a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[*]</span></span></span></a> Although Axiom’s website
never displayed NAM’s trademarked terms to visitors and never mentioned NAM or
NAM’s products, Axiom nonetheless included the terms within its meta tags to
influence Internet search engines. For instance, evidence in this case
indicated that, before Axiom removed these meta tags from its website, if a
computer user <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1217_1"></a>entered the trademarked terms
into Google’s Internet search engine, Google listed Axiom’s website as the
second most relevant search result. In addition, Google provided the searcher
with a brief description of Axiom’s website, and the description included these
terms and highlighted them.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00332015725149_ID0"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B52015725149_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The false advertising claims stem from certain
statements that Axiom made about its product, the DRX 9000. In particular, two
representations by Axiom are relevant to this appeal.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B00442015725149_ID0"></a> First, Axiom represented
in various ways that an affiliation exists between NASA and Axiom or between
NASA and the DRX 9000. Second, Axiom asserted in advertisements that the DRX
9000 is FDA “approved.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court issued a preliminary injunction
in favor of NAM and Adagen, prohibiting Axiom from using NAM’s trademarks
within meta tags and prohibiting Axiom from making the challenged statements
about the DRX 9000. Among other things, the district court specifically found
that Axiom’s use of NAM’s trademarks created a likelihood of confusion, and the
court also found that Axiom’s advertising statements are literally false and
material to consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court reviewed and affirmed the district court’s
trademark infringement and false advertising rulings</i>].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>C. Presumptions of Irreparable Harm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even though we hold that NAM and Adagen have
established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their
trademark infringement and false advertising claims, we must still evaluate
whether NAM and Adagen have demonstrated, with respect to each claim, that they
will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. In reaching its
conclusion that NAM and Adagen satisfied this element of the preliminary
injunction test, the district court relied on two presumptions, one regarding
the infringement claims and one regarding the false advertising claims. For the
reasons that follow, we vacate the preliminary injunction with respect to both
the trademark claims and the false advertising claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_Ia6d9e2d99b6b11e38578f7ccc38dc"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. Irreparable Harm in False Advertising Cases</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court erred when it presumed that NAM
and Adagen would <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1227_1"></a>suffer irreparable harm in
the absence of a preliminary injunction merely because Axiom’s advertisements
are literally false. The district court cited a case out of the Northern
District of Georgia, <i>Energy Four, Inc. v. Dornier Medical Systems, Inc.,</i>
765 F.Supp. 724, 734 (N.D.Ga. 1991), for the following proposition: “In false
advertising cases, ‘[p]roof of falsity is sufficient to sustain a finding of
irreparable injury for purposes of a preliminary injunction.’” This quote,
however, is an incomplete statement of the law. Proof of falsity is generally
only sufficient to sustain a finding of irreparable injury when the false
statement is made in the context of comparative advertising between the
plaintiff’s and defendant’s products. <i>See</i> McCarthy, § 27:37 (“Where the
challenged advertising makes a misleading comparison to a competitor’s product,
irreparable harm is presumed. But if the false advertising is non-comparative
and makes no direct reference to a competitor’s product, irreparable harm is
not presumed.” (internal footnotes omitted)). Although some cases, such as the
one cited by the district court, employ language that may suggest a more
expansive presumption, such quotes take the original principle out of context
without explanation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>] </span>Once this presumption is properly stated, it
becomes evident that NAM and Adagen are not entitled to the presumption’s
benefits because Axiom’s statements, although false, do not mention NAM’s
products by name or in any way compare Axiom’s products with NAM’s products.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B016162015725149_ID"></a><a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[†]</span></span></span></a> This is not to say that NAM
and Adagen could not demonstrate, absent the presumption, that they will suffer
irreparable harm from Axiom’s false advertising, but the district court abused
its discretion by relying solely on the presumption to find irreparable harm.
Accordingly, we vacate the preliminary injunction to the extent it proscribes
Axiom’s false advertising, and we remand to the district court to determine
whether NAM and Adagen will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a
preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_Ia6d9e2da9b6b11e38578f7ccc38dc"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. Irreparable Harm in Trademark Infringement Cases</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Regardless of whether NAM deserves a presumption of
irreparable harm on its false advertising claims, our prior cases do extend a
presumption of irreparable harm once a plaintiff establishes a likelihood of
success on the merits of a trademark infringement claim. Our circuit has
acknowledged as much on several occasions. <i>See, e.g., Tally&#8211;Ho, Inc.
v. Coast Cmty. Coll. Dist.,</i> 889 F.2d 1018, 1029 (11th Cir. 1989) (“‘It is
generally recognized in trademark infringement cases that (1) there is not [an]
adequate remedy at law to redress infringement and (2) infringement by its
nature causes irreparable harm.’ ” (quoting <i>Processed Plastic Co. v. Warner
Commc’ns,</i> 675 F.2d 852, 858 (7th Cir. 1982))); <i>McDonald’s Corp. v.
Robertson,</i> 147 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nonetheless, although established law entitles NAM
and Adagen to this presumption in the trademark infringement context, a recent
U.S. Supreme Court case calls into question whether courts may presume
irreparable harm merely because a plaintiff in an intellectual property case
has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. <i>See generally eBay
Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.,</i> 547 U.S. 388 (2006). In <i>eBay,</i> after a
jury had found patent infringement by the defendant, the district court denied
the plaintiff’s motion for permanent <a name="co_pp_sp_506_1228_1"></a>injunctive
relief. <i>Id.</i> at 390&#8211;91. In so doing, the district court “appeared
to adopt certain expansive principles suggesting that injunctive relief could
not issue in a broad swath of cases.” <i>Id.</i> at 393. On appeal, the Federal
Circuit reversed the denial of injunctive relief, articulating a categorical
rule that permanent injunctions shall issue once infringement is established. <i>Id.</i>
at 393&#8211;94. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit and admonished
both the district and appellate courts for applying categorical rules to the
grant or denial of injunctive relief. <i>Id.</i> at 394. The Court stressed
that the Patent Act indicates “that injunctive relief ‘may’ issue only ‘in
accordance with the principles of equity.’ ” <i>Id.</i> at 393. Because the
Court concluded “that neither court below correctly applied the traditional
four-factor framework that governs the award of injunctive relief, [it] vacated
the judgment of the Court of Appeals, so that the District Court may apply that
framework in the first instance.” <i>Id.</i> at 394. The Supreme Court held
that while “the decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests
within the equitable discretion of the district courts, ... such discretion
must be exercised consistent with traditional principles of equity, in patent
disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards.” <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although <i>eBay</i> dealt with the Patent Act and
with permanent injunctive relief, a strong case can be made that <i>eBay</i>’s
holding necessarily extends to the grant of preliminary injunctions under the
Lanham Act. Similar to the Patent Act, the Lanham Act grants federal courts the
“power to grant injunctions, according to the principles of equity and upon
such terms as the court may deem reasonable.” 15 U.S.C. § 1116(a) (2006).
Furthermore, no obvious distinction exists between permanent and preliminary
injunctive relief to suggest that <i>eBay</i> should not apply to the latter.
Because the language of the Lanham Act&#8212;granting federal courts the power
to grant injunctions “according to the principles of equity and upon such terms
as the court may deem reasonable”&#8212;is so similar to the language of the
Patent Act, we conclude that the Supreme Court’s <i>eBay</i> case is applicable
to the instant case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, we decline to express any further opinion
with respect to the effect of <i>eBay</i> on this case. For example, we decline
to decide whether the district court was correct in its holding that the nature
of the trademark infringement gives rise to a presumption of irreparable
injury. In other words, we decline to address whether such a presumption is the
equivalent of the categorical rules rejected by the Court in <i>eBay.</i> We
decline to address such issues for several reasons. First, the briefing on
appeal has been entirely inadequate in this regard. Second, the district court
has not addressed the effect of <i>eBay.</i> Finally, the district court may
well conclude on remand that it can readily reach an appropriate decision by
fully applying <i>eBay</i> without the benefit of a presumption of irreparable
injury, or it may well decide that the particular circumstances of the instant
case bear substantial parallels to previous cases such that a presumption of
irreparable injury is an appropriate exercise of its discretion in light of the
historical traditions. <i>See eBay,</i> 547 U.S. at 394&#8211;97 (concurring
opinions of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy, representing the views
of seven Justices). Accordingly, we also vacate the preliminary injunction as
it applies to the trademark infringement claim, and remand to the district court
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, and with <i>eBay.</i></p>

<i>Bulman v. 2BKCO, Inc.,</i> 882 F.Supp.2d 551, 557 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). A court
can also grant a preliminary injunction “in situations where it cannot
determine with certainty that the moving party is more likely than not to
prevail on the merits of the underlying claim, but where the costs outweigh the
benefits of not granting the injunction.” <i>Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v.

speculative, but actual and imminent, and one that cannot be remedied if a
court waits until the end of trial to resolve the harm.” <i>Id.</i>
(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, a plaintiff
must show “that there is a continuing harm which cannot be adequately redressed
by final relief on the merits and for which money damages cannot provide
adequate compensation.” <i>Kamerling v. Massanari,</i> 295 F.3d 206, 214 (2d

the party seeking the injunction shows that it will lose control over the
reputation of its trademark ... because loss of control over one’s reputation
is neither ‘calculable nor precisely compensable.’” <i>U.S. Polo Ass’n, Inc. v.
PRL USA Holdings Inc.,</i> 800 F.Supp.2d 515, 540 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); <i>NYC

Associates v. Saban Entm’t, Inc.,</i> 60 F.3d 27, 37&#8211;38 (2d Cir. 1995)).
Plaintiff has invested substantial effort and resources in developing the
goodwill associated with the Juicy Marks. Defendants’ infringement in the
United States puts that goodwill at risk by limiting Plaintiff’s ability to
control its brand. <i>See Stern’s Miracle&#8211;Gro Prods., Inc. v. Shark
Prods., Inc.,</i> 823 F.Supp. 1077, 1094 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (plaintiff’s

mark); <i>Bulman,</i> 882 F.Supp.2d at 564 (likelihood of “future confusion”
and “prospective loss of goodwill” despite no claim of “lost business, sales or

irreparable harm may not be presumed upon a showing of likelihood of success on
the merits, <i>see eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC,</i> 547 U.S. 388, 393
(2006), a party’s demonstration of a likelihood of success on an infringement
claim often foretells a finding of irreparable harm. <i>See Marks Org.,</i> 784

a preliminary injunction precludes a finding of irreparable harm. Delay in
seeking a preliminary injunction can weaken a claim of irreparable harm because
“the failure to act sooner undercuts the sense of urgency that ordinarily
accompanies a motion for preliminary relief.” <i>Tough Traveler, Ltd. v.
Outbound Prods.,</i> 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995). Prior to the Second
Circuit’s decision in <i>Salinger,</i> a finding of delay defeated the
presumption of irreparable harm. <i>See, e.g., Weight Watchers Int’l. Inc. v.
Luigino’s, Inc.,</i> 423 F.3d 137, 144 (2d Cir. 2005). Now that courts may not
presume irreparable harm, however, the effect of a finding of delay is uncertain.
<i>See Marcy Playground, Inc. v. Capitol Records, Inc.,</i> 6 F.Supp.2d 277,
282 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (“[T]he Court of Appeals has not yet held that unexcused
delay alone necessarily defeats a preliminary injunction motion.”); <i>New
Look,</i> 2012 WL 251976, at *10 (“[Delay] is now simply one factor to be
considered in determining whether a plaintiff will, in fact, suffer irreparable
harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.”); <i>Marks Org.,</i> 784
F.Supp.2d at 333 (“[<i>Salinger</i>] leaves open the question of what effect
Plaintiff’s delay should have on the Court’s determination of irreparable
injury.”). Courts recognize, however, that a plaintiff’s good faith efforts to
investigate infringement can justify delay. <i>Tough Traveler,</i> 60 F.3d at
968.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiffs have known about Defendants’ sales to
the United States since at least July 16, 2012 and perhaps as early as April
2012. Plaintiff represents that from this time until the filing of the motion
it was continuing to investigate the extent of Defendants’ domestic activities.
While Plaintiff’s delay may call into question its sense of urgency, the Court
does not find the amount of time Plaintiff took to move for preliminary relief
to be unreasonable. <i>See, e.g., Bulman,</i> 882 F.Supp.2d at 564&#8211;65
(delay of several months did not preclude finding of irreparable harm); <i>Marks
Org.,</i> 784 F.Supp.2d at 332&#8211;36 (granting preliminary injunction
despite nearly sixteen-month delay between learning of infringing conduct and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span

hardships between the plaintiff and defendant and issue the injunction only if
the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff’s favor.” <i>Salinger,</i> 607
F.3d at 80. If Defendants continue to sell their products in the United States,
Plaintiff faces potential loss of sales, goodwill and control over its
reputation. By contrast, enjoining Defendants from using the Juicy Marks in
connection with sales or advertising in the United States would not present
significant hardship because their current sales in the United States are
minimal, particularly in comparison to their sales in Hong Kong, Macao, and the
People’s Republic of China. Such an injunction would not affect the mainstay of
Defendants’ business. Thus, the balance of hardships tips in Plaintiff’s favor
with regard to a carefully tailored injunction.<a

interest would not be disserved’ by the issuance of a preliminary injunction.” <i>Salinger,</i>
607 F.3d at 80 (quoting <i>eBay,</i> 547 U.S. at 391). The Second Circuit has
long held that there is a “strong interest in preventing public confusion.” <i>ProFitness
Phys. Therapy Ctr. v. Pro&#8211;Fit Ortho. and Sports Phys. Therapy P.C.,</i>
314 F.3d 62, 68 (2d Cir. 2002). Plaintiff has established that Defendants’
actions are likely to cause consumer confusion. Therefore, the public interest
would not be disserved by the issuance of a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trademark doctrine on recovery of defendant’s profits and

<p class=Blockquote>The case law on monetary recovery in trademark infringement
cases is a confusing melange of common law and equity principles, sometimes
guided (and misguided) by analogies to patent and copyright law, and finding
little statutory guidance in the Lanham Act. The courts have balanced several
factors such as: whether defendant was willful, negligent, or innocent; whether
plaintiff suffered losses in any provable amount; whether there is proof of
actual confusion of some customers; and whether defendant realized profits from
its infringing actions. In various cases, different courts have given widely
disparate emphasis to one or more of these factors, making predictability of
result a dangerous undertaking.  In various cases, different courts have given
widely disparate emphasis to one or more of these fac tors, making
predictability of result a dangerous undertaking. In modern cases, courts have
occasionally awarded monetary recovery on the rationales of preventing unjust
enrichment and/or deterrence of defendant and others.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> §
30:58.  <i>See also</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Brian E. Banner,
Trademark Infringement Remedies</span> (2012).  As a practical matter, any
trademark litigator must focus on the most recent doctrine within her own
circuit and cannot rely on generalizations about trademark law nationally.  She
must also be aware of special exceptions in certain circumstances in certain
circuits, such as when the parties are directly competing or when they are
engaged in a licensee or franchisee relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given this state of affairs, what follows briefly below is only
a highly schematic review of certain “highlights” of the doctrine various
courts have adopted in deciding whether to award defendant’s profits or
plaintiff’s damages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392010852">1.      Recovery of Defendant’s Profits</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Willful Intent and Profits</i>.  Most circuits have
traditionally required that in order to obtain an accounting of the defendant’s
profits, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with willful intent. 
<i>See, e.g</i>., <i>International Star Class Yacht Racing Ass'n v. Tommy
Hilfiger, U.S.A., Inc</i>., 80 F.3d 749, 753 (2d Cir. 1996) (“In order to
recover an accounting of an infringer's profits, a plaintiff must prove that
the infringer acted in bad faith”); <i>ALPO Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co</i>.,
913 F.2d 958, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ([A]n award based on a defendant's profits
requires proof that the defendant acted willfully or in bad faith.”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, in 1999, Congress amended Lanham Act § 35(a), 15
U.S.C. § 1117(a), so that the phrase “a violation under section 1125(a) of this
title, or a willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title” replaced the
phrase “or a violation under section 1125(a).” (The relevant phrase was subsequently
amended to its present form: “a violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this
title, or a willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title”).  In <i>Quick
Technologies, Inc. v. Sage Group PLC</i>, 313 F.3d 338 (5th Cir. 2002), the
Fifth Circuit interpreted this 1999 amendment as indicating that willfulness
was a threshold requirement for monetary recovery only with respect to
violations of the Lanham Act’s antidilution section, §&nbsp;43(c), 15 U.S.C. §
1125(c).  <i>See</i> <i>Quick Technologies, </i>313 F.3d at 349 (“It is obvious
from our cases that willful infringement is an important factor which must be
considered when determining whether an accounting of profits is appropriate. In
accordance with our previous decisions, and in light of the plain language of §
1117(a), however, we decline to adopt a bright-line rule in which a showing of
willful infringement is a prerequisite to an accounting of profits.” (footnote
omitted)).  In <i>Quick Technologies</i>, the Firth Circuit reaffirmed its
“factor-based approach”, which includes intent as the first among six factors,
to determine if an award of profits is appropriate:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The factors to be considered include, but are not limited
to (1) whether the defendant had the intent to confuse or deceive, (2) whether
sales have been diverted, (3) the adequacy of other remedies, (4) any
unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in asserting his rights, (5) the public
interest in making the misconduct unprofitable, and (6) whether it is a case of
palming off.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Certain other circuits have followed the Fifth Circuit’s
multifactor approach.  <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Banjo Buddies, Inc. v. Renosky</i>,
399 F.3d 168 (3d Cir. 2005); <i>Synergistic Intern., LLC v. Korman</i>, 470
F.3d 162 (4th Cir. 2006).  <i>See also</i> <i>Powerhouse Marks, LLC v. Chi Hsin
Impex, Inc</i>., No. 04 Civ. 73923, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4021 (E.D. Mich. Feb.
2, 2000).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still other circuits, such as the Second, Seventh, and
Ninth, have not apparently explicitly addressed the impact of the 1999
amendment.  <i>Cf. Adray v. Adry-Mart, Inc</i>., 76 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir.
1995) (“Adray argues on appeal that the district court erred in instructing the
jury that it must find willful infringement before awarding defendant's profits
to Adray. An instruction that willful infringement is a prerequisite to an
award of defendant's profits may be error in some circumstances (as when
plaintiff seeks the defendant's profits as a measure of his own damage, <i>Lindy
Pen Co. v. Bic Pen Corp</i>., 982 F.2d 1400, 1407&#8211;09 (9th Cir.1993)), but
was appropriate on the record in this case [in which plaintiff seeks profits
under an unjust enrichment theory]”).  Within the Second Circuit, at least one
district court has endorsed the Fifth Circuit approach, <i>Nike, Inc. v. Top
Brand Co. Ltd</i>., No. 00 CIV 8179, 2005 WL 1654859, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 13,
2005), while several others have adhered to the traditional rule that profits
will be awarded only upon a showing of willful intent. <i>See, e.g., Malletier
v. Dooney &amp; Bourke, Inc</i>., 500 F. Supp. 2d 276, 280-81 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); <i>de
Venustas v. Venustas Int'l, LLC</i>, No. 07 Civ. 4530, 2008 WL 619028, *1
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Actual Confusion and Profits</i>.  Most circuits do not
require a showing of actual confusion to trigger a disgorgement of defendant’s
profits.  <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Web Printing Controls Co., Inc. v. Oxy-Dry Corp</i>.,
906 F.2d 1202, 1205 (7th Cir. 1990) (“These remedies [including a recovery of
defendant’s profits] flow not from the plaintiff's proof of its injury or
damage, but from its proof of the defendant's unjust enrichment or the need for
deterrence, for example…. To collapse the two inquiries of violation and remedy
into one which asks only of the plaintiff's injury, as did the district court,
is to read out of the Lanham Act the remedies that do not rely on proof of
‘injury caused by actual confusion.’ And this, of course, is improper.”); <i>Gracie
v. Gracie</i>, 217 F.3d 1060, 1068 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[A] showing of actual
confusion is not necessary to obtain a recovery of profits.”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Circuit, by contrast, is generally understood to
require a showing of actual confusion for defendant’s profits to be awarded to
the plaintiff.  <i>See</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
§ 30:63 (“The Second Circuit has indicated, albeit with less than perfect
clarity or adequate explanation, that some evidence of actual confusion is
needed to recover profits.”).  <i>See also Banff, Ltd. v. Colberts, Inc</i>.,
996 F.2d 33, 35 (2d Cir. 1993) (“As stated in <i>George Basch Co. v. Blue
Coral, Inc</i>., 968 F.2d 1532, 1538 (2d Cir.), ‘[a] profits award, premised on
a theory of unjust enrichment requires a showing of actual consumer confusion,
or at least proof of deceptive intent, so as to raise the rebuttable
presumption of consumer confusion.’”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Apportionment</i>.  Note that Lanham Act § 35(a) provides
that: “In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant's
sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed.”</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392010853">2.      Recovery of Plaintiff’s Damages</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Actual Confusion and Damages</i>.  Courts typically
require a showing of actual confusion for damages to be awarded.  <i>See, e.g</i>.,
B<i>runswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co</i>., 832 F.2d 513, 523 (10th Cir. 1987) (“Likelihood
of confusion is insufficient; to recover damages plaintiff must prove it has
been damaged by actual consumer confusion or deception resulting from the
violation…. Actual consumer confusion may be shown by direct evidence, a
diversion of sales or direct testimony from the public, or by circumstantial
evidence such as consumer surveys.”); <i>Int'l Star Class Yacht Racing Ass'n v.
Tommy Hilfiger, U.S.A</i>., Inc., 80 F.3d 749, 753 (2d Cir. 1996) (“Proof of
actual confusion is ordinarily required for recovery of damages for pecuniary
loss sustained by the plaintiff.”). “Such damages may include compensation for
(1) lost sales or revenue; (2) sales at lower prices; (3) harm to market
reputation; or (4) expenditures to prevent, correct, or mitigate consumer
confusion.”  <i>Id</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Intent and Damages</i>.  Court typically do not require a
showing of defendant’s willful intent for damages to be awarded. <i>See, e.g</i>.,
<i>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Speicher</i>, 877 F.2d 531, 535 (7th Cir. 1989) (“[E]ven
if he is an innocent infringer he ought at least reimburse the plaintiff's
losses.”).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc392010854">C.       Attorney’s Fees</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co</i>.,
386 U.S. 714 (1967), the Supreme Court held that the Lanham Act did not provide
for the award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party.  In 1975, Congress
amended Lanham Act § 35(a),  15 U.S.C. 1117(a), by adding the sentence: “The
court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing
party.”  As with monetary recovery doctrine in trademark law, the doctrine
relating to recovery of attorney’s fees varies randomly across the circuits.  <i>See
Nightingale Home Healthcare, Inc. v. Anodyne Therapy, LLC</i>, 626 F.3d 958
(7th Cir. 2010) (Posner, J.) (reviewing the “jumble” of the circuits’ tests for
an award of attorney’s fees). The circuits generally require bad faith or
willful infringement or bad faith, vexatious, or “oppressive” litigation.  <i>See
Eagles, Ltd. v. American Eagle Foundation</i>, 356 F.3d 724, 728 (6th Cir.2004)
(defining “oppressive” litigation).  Some circuits apply different evidentiary
and substantive standards depending on whether the prevailing party is the
plaintiff or the defendant. <i>See Nightingale Home Healthcare</i>, 626 F.3d at
961.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on a 1981 study, McCarthy suggests that attorney’s
fees are awarded “with some regularity,” but there is no recent empirical
evidence to support&#8212;or contradict&#8212;this claim. <i>See</i> <span

<p class=Blockquote><b>Lanham Act § 35(b) &amp; (c), 15 U.S.C. § 1117(b) &amp;
(c)</b></p>

<p class=Blockquote>(b) Treble damages for use of counterfeit mark</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>In assessing damages under subsection (a) for any
violation of section 1114(1)(a) of this title or section 220506 of Title 36, in
a case involving use of a counterfeit mark or designation (as defined in
section 1116(d) of this title), the court shall, unless the court finds
extenuating circumstances, enter judgment for three times such profits or
damages, whichever amount is greater, together with a reasonable attorney's
fee, if the violation consists of</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(1) intentionally using a mark or designation,
knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark (as defined in section
1116(d) of this title), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or
distribution of goods or services; or</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(2) providing goods or services necessary to the
commission of a violation specified in paragraph (1), with the intent that the
recipient of the goods or services would put the goods or services to use in
committing the violation.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>In such a case, the court may award prejudgment
interest on such amount at an annual interest rate established under section
6621(a)(2) of Title 26, beginning on the date of the service of the claimant's
pleadings setting forth the claim for such entry of judgment and ending on the
date such entry is made, or for such shorter time as the court considers
appropriate.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(c) Statutory damages for use of counterfeit marks</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>In a case involving the use of a counterfeit mark (as
defined in section 1116(d) of this title) in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, or distribution of goods or services, the plaintiff may elect, at any
time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to recover, instead
of actual damages and profits under subsection (a) of this section, an award of
statutory damages for any such use in connection with the sale, offering for
sale, or distribution of goods or services in the amount of--</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(1) not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 per
counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or
distributed, as the court considers just; or</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(2) if the court finds that the use of the
counterfeit mark was willful, not more than $2,000,000 per counterfeit mark per
type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court
considers just.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lanham Act § 34(d)(1)(B), 15 U.S.C. § 1116(d)(1)(B), defines
the term “counterfeit mark”:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(B) As used in this subsection the term “counterfeit mark”
means--</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent style='margin-left:.6in'>(i) a counterfeit of a mark
that is registered on the principal register in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office for such goods or services sold, offered for sale, or
distributed and that is in use, whether or not the person against whom relief
is sought knew such mark was so registered; or</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent style='margin-left:.6in'>(ii) a spurious designation
that is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a designation
as to which the remedies of this chapter are made available by reason of
section 220506 of Title 36;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>but such term does not include any mark or designation used
on or in connection with goods or services of which the manufacture or producer
was, at the time of the manufacture or production in question authorized to use
the mark or designation for the type of goods or services so manufactured or
produced, by the holder of the right to use such mark or designation.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Lanham Act § 45, 15 U.S.C. § 1127, provides a
definition of “counterfeit”: “A ‘counterfeit’ is a spurious mark which is
identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered mark.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courts have not hesitated to grant substantial statutory
damages awards.  <i>See, e.g., Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Akanoc
Solutions, Inc</i>., 658 F.3d 936, 946 (9th Cir. 2011) (affirming jury award of
$10.5 million in statutory damages for contributory trademark infringement); St<i>ate
of Idaho Potato Com'n v. G &amp; T Terminal Packaging, Inc</i>., 425 F.3d 708
(9th Cir. 2005) ($100,000 in statutory damages against ex-licensee of
certification mark whose continued use was deemed to be counterfeit use); <i>Nike

2003) ($900,000 in statutory damages; $100,000 for nine categories of
counterfeit goods; awarded instead of $1,350,392 profits).</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc392010856">E.       Federal Criminal Penalties for
Counterfeiting</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1984, Congress for the first time made trademark
counterfeiting a federal crime. Congress has enhanced criminal penalties for
counterfeiting with amendments in 1996, 2006, and 2008.  <i>See</i> <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> § 30:116. The criminal penalty
regime is set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2320.  The first offense by an individual
may result in a fine of not more than $2,000,000 and/or imprisonment of not
more than 10 years (for corporations, which are unimprisonable persons, the
fine may not exceed $5,000,000).  A second offense by an individual may result
in a fine of not more than $5,000,000 (for corporation, $15,000,000) and
imprisonment of not more than 20 years.  Individuals whose counterfeiting
conduct results in a “serious bodily injury or death” face significantly
enhanced penalties.  “Whoever knowingly or recklessly causes or attempts to
cause serious bodily injury” from counterfeiting conduct faces up to 20 years
in prison. “Whoever knowingly or recklessly causes or attempts to cause death”
from counterfeiting conduct faces up to life in prison.  Finally, individuals
who engage in counterfeiting of “military goods or services” and
pharmaceuticals also face enhanced penalties&#8212;for a first offense, not
more than 20 years in prison and a fine of not more than $15,000,000; for a
second offense, not more than 30 years in prison and a fine of not more than
$30,000,000.</p>
