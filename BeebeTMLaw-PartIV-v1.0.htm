<p class=MsoNormal>We turn now to federal false advertising law under Lanham
Act � 43(a)(1)(B), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(B).&nbsp; Note from the very

Plaintiffs may seek redress from the Federal Trade Commission under the FTC
Act, 15 U.S.C. �� 41-58, from the �little� or �baby� FTC Acts of the states,

<p class=MsoNormal>As originally drafted, � 43(a) covered only an advertiser�s
�false description or representation� about itself; it did not cover
�commercial disparagement,� i.e., the advertiser�s false representations about
someone else.&nbsp; The Trademark Revision Act of 1988 significantly expanded
the scope of � 43(a) and made clear its application to a defendant�s false
representations about itself and others.&nbsp; Here is � 43(a)(1)(B) in its current
form:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any
goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term,
name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation
of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading
representation of fact, which--</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(B) in commercial advertising or promotion,
misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of
his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities,</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>shall be liable in a civil action by any person who
believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(B).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In what follows, we will cover the various ways in which a
statement may trigger liability under � 43(a)(1)(B).&nbsp; First (Part IV.A.1),
a statement may be <i>literally false</i>, as in <i>S.C. Johnson &amp; Son,
Inc. v Clorox Co</i>., 241 F.3d 232 (2d Cir. 2001), where the defendant�s
television commercial and print advertisements falsely depicted the rate of
leakage of the plaintiff�s resealable plastic bags.&nbsp; Second (Part IV.A.2),
a statement may be <i>literally false by necessary implication</i>, as in <i>Time
Warner Cable, Inc. v. DIRECTV, Inc</i>., 497 F.3d 144 (2d Cir. 2007), where one
of the defendant�s television commercials made the
false-by-necessary-implication claim that its transmitted picture quality was
superior to the plaintiff�s.&nbsp; Third (Part IV.A.3), a statement may be
merely <i>misleading</i>, i.e., impliedly false, which is discussed in <i>Pizza
Hut, Inc. v. Papa John's Intern., Inc</i>., 227 F.3d 489 (5th Cir. 2000), in
connection with the defendant�s slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.�&nbsp;
Finally in Part IV.A.4, we will turn to the issue of substantiation,
particularly in connection with advertisements that claim that �tests prove� or
�studies show� some factual proposition.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>HALL, District Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case involves a Lanham Act challenge to the
truthfulness of a television commercial and print advertisement depicting the
plight of an animated goldfish in a Ziploc Slide&#8211;Loc bag that is being
held upside down and is leaking water. Plaintiff-appellee S.C. Johnson &amp;
Son manufactures the Ziploc bags targeted by the advertisements. In an Order
dated April 6, 2000, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (Griesa, J.) permanently enjoined the defendant-appellant, The
Clorox Company, manufacturer of Ziploc's rival Glad&#8211;Lock resealable
storage bags, from using these advertisements. <i>See S.C. Johnson &amp; Son v.
The Clorox Co.,</i> No. 99 Civ. 11079 (TPG), 2000 WL 423534, 2000 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 4977 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 19, 2000) (�<i>S.C. Johnson II</i>�). We conclude
that the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering this
injunction and accordingly affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In August 1999, Clorox introduced a 15&#8211;second
and a 30&#8211;second television commercial (�Goldfish I�), each depicting an
S.C. Johnson Ziploc Slide&#8211;Loc resealable storage bag side-by-side with a
Clorox Glad&#8211;Lock bag. The bags are identified in the commercials by brand
name. Both commercials show an animated, talking goldfish in water inside each
of the bags. In the commercials, the bags are turned upside-down, and the
Slide&#8211;Loc bag leaks rapidly while the Glad&#8211;Lock bag does not leak
at all. In both the 15&#8211; and 30&#8211;second Goldfish I commercials, the
Slide&#8211;Loc goldfish says, in clear distress, �My Ziploc Slider is
dripping. Wait a minute!,� while the Slide Loc bag is shown leaking at a rate
of approximately one drop per one to two seconds. In the 30&#8211;second
Goldfish I commercial only, the Slide&#8211;Loc bag is shown leaking while the
Slide&#8211;Loc goldfish says, �Excuse me, a little help here,� and then, �Oh,
dripping, dripping.� At the end of both commercials, the Slide Loc goldfish
exclaims, �Can I borrow a cup of water!!!�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On November 4, 1999, S.C. Johnson brought an action
against Clorox under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a), for
false advertising in the Goldfish I commercials. After S.C. Johnson moved for a
preliminary injunction, the district court converted the evidentiary hearing on
the motion to a trial on the merits under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Phillip DeLassus, an outside expert retained by
S.C. Johnson, conducted �torture testing,� in which Slide&#8211;Loc bags were
filled with water, rotated for 10 seconds, and held upside-down for an
additional 20 seconds. He testified about the results of the tests he
performed, emphasizing that 37 percent of all Slide&#8211;Loc bags tested did
not leak at all. Of the remaining 63 percent that did leak, only a small
percentage leaked at the rate depicted in the Goldfish I television
commercials. The vast majority leaked at a rate between two and twenty times
slower than that depicted in the Goldfish I commercials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On January 7, 2000, the district court entered
findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record in support of an Order
permanently enjoining Clorox from disseminating the Goldfish I television
commercials. Specifically, the district court found that S.C. Johnson had shown
by a preponderance of the evidence that the Goldfish I commercials are
�literally false in respect to its depiction of the flow of water out of the
Slide&#8211;Loc bag.� <i>S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Clorox Co.,</i> No. 99
Civ. 11079 (TPG), 2000 WL 122209, at *1, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3621, at
*1&#8211;*2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2000) (�<i>S.C. Johnson I</i>�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court found that �the commercial impermissibly
exaggerates the facts in respect to the flow of water or the leaking of water
out of a Slide&#8211;Loc bag.� <i>Id.,</i> at *1. The court further found that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[t]he commercial shows drops of water coming out of the bag
at what appears to be a rapid rate. In fact, the rate is about one fairly large
drop per second. Moreover, there is a depiction of the water level in the bag
undergoing a substantial and rapid decline. Finally, there is an image of
bubbles going through the water.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at *1, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3621, at
*2&#8211;*3. The district court found that �the overall depiction in the
commercial itself is of a rapid and substantial leakage and flow of water out
of the Slide&#8211;Loc bag.� <i>Id.</i> at *1, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3621, at
*3. The court noted that �[t]his is rendered even more graphic by the fact that
there is a goldfish depicted in the bag which is shown to be in jeopardy
because the water is running out at such a rate.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court found �that when these bags are
subjected to the same kind of quality control test as used by Clorox for the
Glad bags, there is some leakage in about two-thirds of the cases.� <i>Id.</i>
at *2, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3621, at *4. However, the court found �that the
great majority of those leaks are very small and at a very slow rate.� <i>Id.</i>
The court found that �[o]nly in about 10 percent of these bags is there leakage
at the rate shown in the commercial, that is, one drop per second.� <i>Id.</i>
The district court further found that �[t]he problem with the commercial is
that there is no depiction in the visual images to indicate anything else than
the fact that the type of fairly rapid and substantial leakage shown in the
commercial is simply characteristic of that kind of bag.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, the court held that �the Clorox
commercial in question misrepresents the Slide&#8211;Loc bag product,� and that
this �finding relates to the different sizes and types of the Slide&#8211;Loc
bags because there is no attempt to limit the commercial to any particular
category.� <i>Id.</i> at *3, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3621, at *7. The court
entered an injunction, noting that S.C. Johnson had shown irreparable harm
sufficient to support an injunction because, as the court found, the Goldfish I
commercials are literally false. <i>Id.</i> The district court rejected S.C.
Johnson's other theories of relief under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act,
including a claim of implied falsity. <i>Id.</i> at *3, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
3621, at *6&#8211;*7. Clorox has not appealed this January 7 permanent
injunction relating to the Goldfish I commercials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In February 2000, Clorox released a modified
version of the Goldfish I television commercials as well as a related print
advertisement (�Goldfish II�). In the 15 second Goldfish II television
commercial, a Ziploc Slide&#8211;Loc bag and Glad&#8211;Lock bag are again
shown side-by-side, filled with water and containing an animated, talking
goldfish. The bags are then rotated, and a drop is shown forming and dropping
in about a second from the Slide&#8211;Loc bag. During the approximately
additional two seconds that it is shown, the Slide&#8211;Loc goldfish says, �My
Ziploc slider is dripping. Wait a minute.� The two bags are then off-screen for
approximately eight seconds before the Slide&#8211;Loc bag is again shown, with
a drop forming and falling in approximately one second. During this latter
depiction of the Slide&#8211;Loc bag, the Slide&#8211;Loc goldfish says, �Hey,
I'm gonna need a little help here.� Both bags are identified by brand name, and
the Glad&#8211;Lock bag does not leak at all. The second-to-last frame shows
three puddles on an orange background that includes the phrase �Don't Get Mad.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the print advertisement, a large drop is shown
forming and about to fall from an upside-down Slide&#8211;Loc bag in which a
goldfish is partially out of the water. Bubbles are shown rising from the point
of the leak in the Slide&#8211;Loc bag. Next to the Slide&#8211;Loc bag is a
Glad&#8211;Lock bag that is not leaking and contains a goldfish that is
completely submerged. Under the Slide&#8211;Loc bag appears: �Yikes! My Ziploc�
Slide&#8211;Loc� is dripping!� Under the Glad&#8211;Lock bag is printed: �My
Glad is tight, tight, tight.� On a third panel, three puddles and the words
�Don't Get Mad� are depicted on a red background. In a fourth panel, the
advertisement recites: �Only Glad has the Double&#8211;Lock� green seal. That's
why you'll be glad you got Glad. Especially if you're a goldfish.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After these advertisements appeared, S.C. Johnson
moved to enlarge the January 7 injunction to enjoin the airing and distribution
of the Goldfish II advertisements. On April 6, 2000, after hearing oral
argument, the district court entered another order on the record, setting forth
further findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of an Order
permanently enjoining the distribution of the Goldfish II television commercial
and print advertisement. The district court explicitly noted that it was �in a
position, in [its] view, to decide the case based on the existing evidence
without further evidence.� <i>S.C. Johnson II,</i> 2000 WL 423534, at *1, 2000
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *1&#8211;*2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court incorporated by reference its prior
findings of fact from its January 7, 2000 Order, stating that it would �not
attempt to repeat what was said in the earlier decision, although a great deal
of it applies to the issue now presented to the court.� <i>Id.</i> at *1, 2000
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *2. The court then stated its finding that,
�[f]ocusing now on the new television commercial, in my view it has the
essential problems of the earlier 15 second commercial.� <i>Id.</i> The court
observed that the Goldfish II commercial �does not literally portray a rate of
leakage which was portrayed in the earlier ad and which was the subject of
certain of my findings in the earlier decision.� <i>Id.</i> at *1, 2000 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *3. Instead, the court noted,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[t]here are two images shown of the slide-lock bag upside
down with water coming out, two separate images. In each image a large drop
immediately forms and the water drop falls. That is shown in the first image
and then the commercial switches to some other subject and when the next image
comes of the slide-lock bag there again is a large drop immediately forming and
falling away.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at *2, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *4.
The district court referenced its earlier finding that the Goldfish I
commercials did not accurately depict either the rate or risk of leakage in
Slide&#8211;Loc bags. <i>Id.</i> at *2, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at
*4&#8211;*5. The court then found that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[E]ssentially the same problem that I commented upon in the
earlier decision exists with this commercial, with the present commercial.
There is nothing to indicate that anything goes on with the slide-lock bags
except the leaking of large drops as shown in the only two depictions that are
relevant. There is nothing indicated about slow rate or rapid rate. There is
nothing shown except one image and that is an image of a big drop of water
falling out of the bag.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>There is nothing to indicate that
this kind of leakage occurs in only some particular percentage of bags, and
there is nothing to indicate the degree of risk of such leakage. There is only
one image, and that is of a big drop falling out.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at *2, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court rejected Clorox's argument �that what is
really shown [in the Goldfish II television commercial] is that the leakage
occurs at a rather slow rate, perhaps about once every seven or eight seconds.�
<i>Id.</i> According to the court, Clorox �bases this argument on the fact that
if you take the elapsed time between the leak or the drop in the first image
and the drop in the second image, this amount of time elapses.� <i>Id.</i> at
*2, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *5&#8211;*6. The district court found,
however, that �[t]here is nothing visually or in words to indicate that what is
being depicted is some kind of a continuum of the condition of the bag from one
image to the other.� <i>Id.</i> at *2, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *6.
Rather, �[a]ll that is depicted is two separate images, each of which shows the
same thing.� <i>Id.</i> The district court found that �[w]hat is shown is the
images, and what is omitted is any indication about the actual rates and degree
and amount of leakage that the detailed evidence at the trial showed.� <i>Id.</i>
The court further found that the Goldfish II commercial �portray[s] ... a
goldfish in danger of suffocating in air because of the outflow of water from
the bag.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court concluded that the Goldfish II television
commercial �is decidedly contrary to what was portrayed in the actual evidence
about the bags at the first trial, and all in all the television commercial in
my view is literally false.� <i>Id.</i> at *3, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at
*6. The court then addressed the Goldfish II print advertisement, which, it
found �is, if anything, worse,� because �[i]t has a single image of a
Slide&#8211;Loc bag with a large drop about to fall away and a goldfish in
danger of suffocating because the water is as portrayed disappearing from the
bag.� <i>Id.</i> at *3, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *7. The district court
concluded that the Goldfish II print advertisement �is literally false.� <i>Id.</i>
The court also found that the inability of a Ziploc Slide&#8211;Loc bag to
prevent leakage is portrayed as an inherent quality or characteristic of that
product. Accordingly, the court found that the Goldfish II television
commercial and print advertisement �portray[ ] the leakage as simply an
ever-present characteristic of the Slide&#8211;Loc bags.� <i>Id.</i> at *3,
2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *8.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court found, in the alternative, that
the Goldfish II ads were false by necessary implication, a doctrine this court
has not yet recognized, because consumers would necessarily believe that more
viscous liquids such as soups and sauces would leak as rapidly as water. <i>Id.</i>
at *3, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4977, at *6&#8211;*7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Clorox now appeals from this April 6, 2000 Order
permanently enjoining the use of the Goldfish II television commercial and
print advertisement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court found that the Goldfish II
television commercial and print advertisement are literally false in violation of
section 43(a). That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or
services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name,

origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial
activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that
he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1125(a). �Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act
proscribes false designations of origin or false or misleading descriptions of
fact in connection with any goods in commerce that are likely to cause
confusion or that misrepresent the nature, characteristics, qualities, or
geographic origin of the goods.� <i>Groden v. Random House, Inc.,</i> 61 F.3d
1045, 1051 (2d Cir.1995). �The Lanham Act does not prohibit false statements
generally. It prohibits only false or misleading descriptions or false or
misleading representations of fact made about one's own or another's goods or

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court has recently restated the general
requirements for a claim brought under section 43(a):</p>

<p class=Blockquote>To establish a false advertising claim under Section 43(a),
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the statement in the challenged
advertisement is false. �Falsity may be established by proving that (1) the
advertising is literally false as a factual matter, or (2) although the
advertisement is literally true, it is likely to deceive or confuse customers.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Nat'l Basketball Ass'n v. Motorola, Inc.,</i> 105
F.3d 841, 855 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Lipton v. Nature Co.,</i> 71 F.3d 464,
474 (2d Cir.1995)). It is also well-settled that, �in addition to proving
falsity, the plaintiff must also show that the defendants misrepresented an
�inherent quality or characteristic� of the product. This requirement is
essentially one of materiality, a term explicitly used in other circuits.� <i>Id.</i>
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In considering a false advertising claim,
�[f]undamental to any task of interpretation is the principle that text must
yield to context.� <i>Avis,</i> 782 F.2d at 385.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Thus, we have emphasized that in reviewing FTC actions
prohibiting unfair advertising practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act
a court must �consider the advertisement in its entirety and not ... engage in
disputatious dissection. The entire mosaic should be viewed rather than each
tile separately.� Similar approaches have been taken in Lanham Act cases
involving the claim that an advertisement was false on its face.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Moreover, we have
explicitly looked to the visual images in a commercial to assess whether it is
literally false. <i>See Coca&#8211;Cola Co. v. Tropicana Prods., Inc.,</i> 690

must show that it will suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction.� <i>McNeil&#8211;P.C.C.,
Inc. v. Bristol&#8211;Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 938 F.2d 1544, 1549 (2d Cir.1991)

irreparable harm where plaintiff demonstrates a likelihood of success in

clear error in finding that its Goldfish II television commercial and print
advertisement contain literal falsehoods. We find no clear error in the
district court's findings of fact in support of its conclusion that the
Goldfish II television commercial and print advertisement are literally false
as a factual matter. We note that the court made its finding of literal falsity
after a seven-day bench trial. The evidence presented at trial clearly
indicates that, as the court found, only slightly more than one out of ten
Slide&#8211;Loc bags tested dripped at a rate of one drop per second or faster,
while more than one-third of the Slide&#8211;Loc bags tested leaked at a rate
of less than one drop per five seconds. Over half of the Slide&#8211;Loc bags
tested either did not leak at all or leaked at a rate no faster than one drop
per 20 seconds. Moreover, less than two-thirds, or 63 percent, of
Slide&#8211;Loc bags tested showed any leakage at all when subjected to the
testing on which Clorox based its Goldfish I and II advertisements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The only Slide&#8211;Loc bag depicted in each of
the two Goldfish II advertisements, on the other hand, is shown leaking and,
when shown, is always leaking. Moreover, each time the Slide&#8211;Loc bag is
on-screen, the Goldfish II television commercial shows a drop forming
immediately and then falling from the Slide&#8211;Loc bag, all over a period of
approximately two seconds. Accordingly, the commercial falsely depicts the risk
of leakage for the vast majority of Slide&#8211;Loc bags tested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Clorox argues that, because approximately eight
seconds pass between the images of the drops forming and falling in the
Goldfish II television commercial, the commercial depicts an accurate rate of
leakage. However, the commercial does not continuously show the condition of
the Slide&#8211;Loc bag because the Slide&#8211;Loc bag is off-screen for eight
seconds. Likewise, the print ad does not depict any rate of leakage at all,
other than to indicate that the Slide&#8211;Loc bag is �dripping.� Clorox's
argument that its commercial shows a �continuum� also fails given that in each
of the Goldfish II advertisements is a background image containing three
puddles of water, when only two drops form and fall in the television
commercial and just one drop forms and nearly falls in the print advertisement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Given the highly deferential standard of review
accorded to the district court's findings entered after a bench trial, we
cannot say that, having viewed the record in its entirety, we are left with the
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <i>See Mobil
Shipping and Transp. Co. v. Wonsild Liquid Carriers Ltd.,</i> 190 F.3d 64,
67&#8211;68 (2d Cir.1999). We find no clear error in the district court's
finding that the depiction of the risk of leakage from Slide&#8211;Loc bags in
the Goldfish II television commercial and print advertisement is literally
false as to an inherent quality or characteristic of Ziploc Slide&#8211;Loc
storage bags.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II. The district court committed no error of law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Clorox alleges that the district court erred in
finding literal falsity because �no facially false claim or depiction was
present in the advertisements at issue in this case.� As such, Clorox argues,
the district court's finding of literal falsity �was based upon an
interpretation of the ads that went beyond their facial or explicit claims.�
According to Clorox, the district court therefore must have based it injunction
on the implied falsity of the ads. Clorox argues that the district court erred
as a matter of law because �any alleged message beyond the literal claims in
the advertisements [must] be proved by extrinsic evidence,� upon which the
district court undeniably did not rely in reaching its conclusions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We disagree. The district court properly concluded
that the Goldfish II advertisements are literally false in violation of section
43(a) of the Lanham Act. The court looked at the Goldfish II television
commercial and print advertisement in their entirety and determined that the
risk of leakage from the Slide&#8211;Loc storage bag depicted in the ads is
literally false based on the evidence presented at trial of the real risk and
rate of leakage from Slide&#8211;Loc bags. The district court's conclusion that
Clorox violated section 43(a) conforms to our earlier precedents applying the
doctrine of literal falsity. In <i>Coca&#8211;Cola,</i> we reversed a district
court's finding of no literal falsity in an orange juice commercial where:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[t]he visual component of the ad makes an explicit
representation that Premium Pack is produced by squeezing oranges and pouring
the freshly-squeezed juice directly into the carton. This is not a true
representation of how the product is prepared. Premium Pack juice is heated and
sometimes frozen prior to packaging.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>690 F.2d at 318. As in <i>Coca&#8211;Cola,</i> the
Goldfish II advertisement depicts a literal falsity that requires no proof by
extrinsic evidence: that Slide&#8211;Loc bags always leak when filled with
water and held upside down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Furthermore, the district court did not erroneously
enjoin Clorox's advertisements on the basis of implied falsity in the absence
of extrinsic evidence. Contrary to Clorox's allegations on appeal, the district
court's conclusion is not based on implied falsity or the district court's own
subjective interpretation of the Goldfish II advertisements. Indeed, Clorox's
purported �literal� reading of the Goldfish II ads requires the viewer to
assume that the bag is not leaking while it is off-screen. It is therefore Clorox's
interpretation that relies upon implication, not the district court's. The
district court did not conclude that the Goldfish II advertisements are
literally true but �nevertheless likely to mislead or confuse consumers.� It
correctly concluded that the advertisements are facially false. As such, our
holding prohibiting a district judge from �determin[ing], based solely upon his
or her own intuitive reaction, whether the advertisement is deceptive� under
the doctrine of implied falsity is not implicated in this case. <i>Johnson
&amp; Johnson * Merck Consumer Pharms. Co. v. Smithkline Beecham Corp.,</i> 960
F.2d 294, 297 (2d Cir.1992).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because we affirm the injunction on the basis of
literal falsity, we need not reach the issue of whether the district court
erred in concluding as an alternative ground that Clorox's Goldfish II
television commercial and print advertisement are false �by necessary
implication� because consumers would necessarily believe that more viscous
liquids than water would also leak rapidly from Ziploc Slide&#8211;Loc storage
bags.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, we find no clearly erroneous findings
of fact and no error of law. We therefore find that the district court did not
abuse its discretion by permanently enjoining Clorox from disseminating the
Goldfish II television commercial and print advertisement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>STRAUB, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendant&#8211;Appellant DIRECTV, Inc. (�DIRECTV�)
appeals from the February 5, 2007 opinion and order of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (Laura Taylor Swain, <i>Judge</i>)
preliminarily enjoining it from disseminating, in any market in which
Plaintiff&#8211;Appellee Time Warner Cable, Inc. (�TWC�) provides cable
service, certain television commercials and Internet advertisements found
likely to violate the Lanham Act on literal falsity grounds. <i>Time Warner
Cable, Inc. v. DIRECTV, Inc.,</i> 475 F.Supp.2d 299 (S.D.N.Y.2007).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This appeal requires us to clarify certain aspects
of our false advertising doctrine. We make three clarifications in particular.
First, we hold that an advertisement can be literally false even though it does
not explicitly make a false assertion, if the words or images, considered in
context, necessarily and unambiguously imply a false message. Second, we decide
that the category of non-actionable �puffery� encompasses visual depictions
that, while factually inaccurate, are so grossly exaggerated that no reasonable
consumer would rely on them in navigating the marketplace. Third, we conclude
that the likelihood of irreparable harm may be presumed where the plaintiff
demonstrates a likelihood of success in showing that the defendant's
comparative advertisement is literally false and that given the nature of the
market, it would be obvious to the viewing audience that the advertisement is
targeted at the plaintiff, even though the plaintiff is not identified by name.
Reviewing the District Court's decision under these principles, we affirm in
part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.</p>

<p class=Centered>FACTUAL BACKGROUND<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[1]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. The Parties</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TWC and DIRECTV are major players in the
multichannel video service industry. TWC is the second-largest cable company in
the United States, serving more than 13.4 million subscribers. Like all cable
providers, TWC must operate through franchises let by local government
entities; it is currently the franchisee in the greater part of New York City.
DIRECTV is one of the country's largest satellite service providers, with more
than 15.6 million customers nationwide. Because DIRECTV broadcasts directly via
satellite, it is not subject to the same franchise limitations as cable
companies. As a result, in the markets where TWC is the franchisee, DIRECTV and
other satellite providers pose the greatest threat to its market share. The
competition in these markets for new customers is extremely fierce, a fact to
which the advertisements challenged in this case attest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TWC offers both analog and digital television
services to its customers. DIRECTV, on the other hand, delivers 100% of its programming
digitally. Both companies, however, offer high-definition (�HD�) service on a
limited number of their respective channels. Transmitted at a higher resolution
than analog or traditional digital programming, HD provides the home viewer
with theater-like picture quality on a wider screen. The picture quality of HD
is governed by standards recommended by the Advanced Television Systems
Committee (�ATSC�), an international non-profit organization that develops
voluntary standards for digital television. To qualify as HD under ATSC
standards, the screen resolution of a television picture must be at least 720p
or 1080i.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[2]</span></span></span></a>
TWC and DIRECTV do not set or alter the screen resolution for HD programming
provided by the networks; instead, they make available sufficient bandwidth to
permit the HD level of resolution to pass on to their customers. To view
programming in HD format, customers of either provider must have an HD
television set.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no dispute, at least on the present
record, that the HD programming provided by TWC and DIRECTV is equivalent in
picture quality. In terms of non-HD programming, digital service generally
yields better picture quality than analog service, because a digital signal is
more resistant to interference. <i>See Consumer Elecs. Ass'n v. F.C.C.,</i> 347
F.3d 291, 293&#8211;94 (D.C.Cir.2003). That said, TWC's analog cable service
satisfies the technical specifications, <i>e.g.</i> signal level requirements
and signal leakage limits, set by the Federal Communications Commission
(�FCC�). <i>See</i> 47 C.F.R. � 76.1, <i>et seq.</i> According to a FCC fact
sheet, analog service that meets these specifications produces a picture that
is �high enough in quality to provide enjoyable viewing with barely perceptible
impairments.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. DIRECTV's �SOURCE MATTERS� Campaign</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the fall of 2006, DIRECTV launched a multimedia
advertising campaign based on the theme of �SOURCE MATTERS.� The concept of the
campaign was to educate consumers that to obtain HD-standard picture quality,
it is not enough to buy an HD television set; consumers must also receive HD
programming from the �source,� <i>i.e.,</i> the television service provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>1. Jessica Simpson Commercial</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As part of its new campaign, DIRECTV began running
a television commercial in October 2006 featuring celebrity Jessica Simpson. In
the commercial, Simpson, portraying her character of Daisy Duke from the movie <i>The
Dukes of Hazzard,</i> says to some of her customers at the local diner:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Simpson: Y'all ready to order?</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Hey, 253 straight days at the gym
to get this body and you're not gonna watch me on DIRECTV HD?</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>You're just not gonna get the best
picture out of some fancy big screen TV without DIRECTV.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>It's broadcast in 1080i. I totally
don't know what that means, but I want it.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>The original version of the commercial concluded with a
narrator saying, �For picture quality that beats cable, you've got to get
DIRECTV.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In response to objections by TWC, and pursuant to
agreements entered into by the parties, DIRECTV pulled the original version of
the commercial and replaced it with a revised one (�Revised Simpson
Commercial�), which began airing in early December 2006. The Revised Simpson
Commercial is identical to the original, except that it ends with a different
tag line: �For an HD picture that can't be beat, get DIRECTV.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>2. William Shatner Commercial</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV debuted another commercial in October 2006,
featuring actor William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, his character from
the popular <i>Star Trek</i> television show and film series. The following
conversation takes place on the Starship Enterprise:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Mr. Chekov: Should we raise our
shields, Captain?</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Captain Kirk: At ease, Mr. Chekov.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Again with the shields. I wish
he'd just relax and enjoy the amazing picture clarity of the DIRECTV HD we just
hooked up.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>With what Starfleet just ponied up
for this big screen TV, settling for cable would be illogical.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Mr. Spock: [Clearing throat.]</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Captain Kirk: What, I can't use
that line?</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>The original version ended with the announcer saying,
�For picture quality that beats cable, you've got to get DIRECTV.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV agreed to stop running the Shatner
commercial in November 2006. In January 2007, DIRECTV released a revised
version of the commercial (�Revised Shatner Commercial�) with the revamped tag
line, �For an HD picture that can't be beat, get DIRECTV.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>3. Internet Advertisements</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV also waged its campaign in cyberspace,
placing banner advertisements on various websites to promote the message that
when it comes to picture quality, �source matters.� The banner ads have the
same basic structure. They open by showing an image that is so highly pixelated
that it is impossible to discern what is being depicted. On top of this
indistinct image is superimposed the slogan, �SOURCE MATTERS.� After about a
second, a vertical line splits the screen into two parts, one labeled �OTHER
TV� and the other �DIRECTV.� On the OTHER TV side of the line, the picture is
extremely pixelated and distorted, like the opening image. By contrast, the
picture on the DIRECTV side is exceptionally sharp and clear. The DIRECTV
screen reveals that what we have been looking at all along is an image of New
York Giants quarterback Eli Manning; in another ad, it is a picture of two
women snorkeling in tropical waters. The advertisements then invite browsers to
�FIND OUT WHY DIRECTV'S picture beats cable� and to �LEARN MORE� about a
special offer. In the original design, users who clicked on the �LEARN MORE�
icon were automatically directed to the HDTV section of DIRECTV's website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to the banner advertisements, DIRECTV
created a demonstrative advertisement that it featured on its own website. Like
the banner ads, the website demonstrative uses the split-screen technique to
compare the picture quality of �DIRECTV� to that of �OTHER TV,� which the ad
later identifies as representing �basic cable,� <i>i.e.,</i> analog cable. The
DIRECTV side of the screen depicts, in high resolution, an image of football
player Kevin Dyson making a touchdown at the Super Bowl. The portion of the
image on the OTHER TV side is noticeably pixelated and blurry. This visual
display is accompanied by the following text: �If you're hooking up your
high-definition TV to basic cable, you're not getting the best picture on every
channel. For unparalleled clarity, you need DIRECTV HD. You'll enjoy 100%
digital picture and sound on every channel and also get the most sports in
HD&#8212;including all your favorite football games in high definition with NFL
SUNDAY TICKET.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. Filing of Action and Stipulation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On December 7, 2006, TWC filed this action charging
DIRECTV with, <i>inter alia,</i> false advertising in violation of � 43(a) of
the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C. � 1114, <i>et seq.</i> Initial negotiations led to
the execution of a stipulation, in which DIRECTV agreed that pending final
resolution of the action, it would stop running the original versions of the
Simpson and Shatner commercials and also disable the link on the banner
advertisements that routed customers to the HDTV page of its website. DIRECTV
further stipulated that it would not claim in any advertisement, either
directly or by implication, that �the picture quality presently offered by
DIRECTV's HDTV service is superior to the picture offered presently by Time
Warner Cable's HDTV service, or the present HDTV services of cable television providers
in general.� Finally, DIRECTV agreed that any breach of the stipulation would
result in irreparable harm to TWC. The stipulation contained the caveat,
however, that nothing in it �shall be construed to be a finding on the merits
of this action.� The District Court entered an order on the stipulation on
December 12, 2006.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. Preliminary Injunction Motion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The following week, on December 18, TWC filed a
motion for a preliminary injunction against the Revised Simpson Commercial, as
well as the banner advertisements and website demonstrative (collectively,
�Internet Advertisements�), none of which were specifically covered by the
stipulation. TWC claimed that each of these advertisements was literally false,
obviating the need for extrinsic evidence of consumer confusion. TWC further
argued that as DIRECTV's direct competitor, it was entitled to a presumption of
irreparable injury. On January 4, 2007, after discovering that DIRECTV had
started running the Revised Shatner Commercial, TWC filed supplemental papers
requesting that this commercial also be preliminarily enjoined on literal
falsity grounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV vigorously opposed the motion. It asserted
that the Revised Simpson and Shatner Commercials were not literally false
because no single statement in the commercials explicitly claimed that DIRECTV
HD is superior to cable HD in terms of picture quality. DIRECTV did not deny
that the Internet Advertisements' depictions of cable were facially false.
Rather, it argued that the Internet Advertisements did not violate the Lanham
Act because the images constituted non-actionable puffery. Finally, DIRECTV
argued that irreparable harm could not be presumed because none of the
contested advertisements identified TWC by name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>C. The District Court's February 5, 2007 Opinion and
Order</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On February 5, 2007, the District Court issued a decision
granting TWC's motion. The District Court determined that TWC had met its
burden of showing that each of the challenged advertisements was likely to be
proven literally false. Addressing the television commercials, the District
Court held that the meaning of particular statements had to be determined in
light of the overall context, and not in a vacuum as urged by DIRECTV. Given
the commercials' obvious focus on HD picture quality, the District Court found
that the Simpson's assertion that a viewer cannot �get the best picture out of
some big fancy big screen TV without DIRECTV� and Shatner's quip that �settling
for cable would be illogical� could only be understood as making the literally
false claim that DIRECTV HD is superior to cable HD in picture quality. <i>See
Time Warner Cable, Inc.,</i> 475 F.Supp.2d at 305&#8211;06. As for the Internet
Advertisements, the District Court found that the facially false depictions of
cable's picture quality could not be discounted as mere puffery because it was
possible that consumers unfamiliar with HD technology would actually rely on
the images in deciding whether to hook up their HD television sets to DIRECTV
or analog cable. <i>See id.</i> at 306&#8211;08.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In assessing irreparable harm <i>vel non,</i> the
District Court observed that under Second Circuit case law, irreparable harm
could be presumed where the movant �demonstrates a likelihood of success in
showing literally false defendant's comparative advertisement which mentions plaintiff's
product by name.� <i>Id.</i> at 308 (quoting <i>Castrol, Inc. v. Quaker State
Corp.,</i> 977 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The District Court acknowledged that the Revised Shatner Commercial and the
Internet Advertisements did not specifically name TWC, but concluded that a
presumption of irreparable harm was nevertheless appropriate because the
advertisements made explicit references to �cable,� and in the markets where
TWC is the franchisee, �cable� is functionally synonymous with �Time Warner
Cable.� <i>See id.</i> As for the Revised Simpson Commercial, the District
Court reasoned that although the advertisement did not explicitly reference
�cable,� irreparable harm should be presumed because �TWC is DIRECTV's main
competitor in markets served by TWC.� <i>Id.</i> The District Court further
noted that DIRECTV had breached the stipulation by continuing to run the
contested commercials and that this breach also supported a finding of
irreparable harm. <i>See id.</i> at n. 5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In accordance with its opinion, the District Court
entered a preliminary injunction barring DIRECTV from disseminating, �in any
market in which [TWC] provides cable service,�</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) the Revised Simpson Commercial and Revised Shatner
Commercial, �and any other advertisement disparaging the visual or audio
quality of TWC or cable high-definition (�HDTV�) programming as compared to
that of DIRECTV or satellite HDTV programming�; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) the Internet Advertisements �and any other
advertisement making representations that the service provided by Time Warner
Cable, or cable service in general, is unwatchable due to blurriness,
distortion, pixellation or the like, or inaudible due to static or other
interference.�</p>

<p class=Centered>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must
establish: (1) either (a) a likelihood of success on the merits of its case or

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Two different theories of recovery are available to
a plaintiff who brings a false advertising action under � 43(a) of the Lanham
Act. First, the plaintiff can demonstrate that the challenged advertisement is
literally false, <i>i.e.,</i> false on its face. <i>See GAC Int'l, Inc.,</i>
862 F.2d at 977. When an advertisement is shown to be literally or facially
false, consumer deception is presumed, and �the court may grant relief without
reference to the advertisement's [actual] impact on the buying public.� <i>Coca&#8211;Cola
Co.,</i> 690 F.2d at 317. �This is because plaintiffs alleging a literal
falsehood are claiming that a statement, on its face, conflicts with reality, a
claim that is best supported by comparing the statement itself with the reality
it purports to describe.� <i>Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc.,</i> 189 F.3d 218,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Alternatively, a plaintiff can show that the
advertisement, while not literally false, is nevertheless likely to mislead or
confuse consumers. <i>See Coca&#8211;Cola Co.,</i> 690 F.2d at 317.
�[P]laintiffs alleging an implied falsehood are claiming that a statement,
whatever its literal truth, has left an impression on the listener [or viewer]
that conflicts with reality�&#8212;a claim that �invites a comparison of the
impression, rather than the statement, with the truth.� <i>Schering Corp.,</i>
189 F.3d at 229. Therefore, whereas �plaintiffs seeking to establish a literal
falsehood must generally show the substance of what is conveyed, ... a district
court <i>must</i> rely on extrinsic evidence [of consumer deception or
confusion] to support a finding of an implicitly false message.� <i>Id.</i>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, TWC chose to pursue only the first path of
literal falsity, and the District Court granted the preliminary injunction
against the television commercials on that basis. In this appeal, DIRECTV does
not dispute that it would be a misrepresentation to claim that the picture
quality of DIRECTV HD is superior to that of cable HD. Rather, it argues that
neither commercial explicitly makes such a claim and therefore cannot be
literally false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>a. Revised Simpson Commercial</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV's argument is easily dismissed with respect
to the Revised Simpson Commercial. In the critical lines, Simpson tells
audiences, �You're just not gonna get the best picture out of some fancy big
screen TV without DIRECTV. It's broadcast in 1080i.� These statements make the
explicit assertion that it is impossible to obtain �the best picture�&#8212;<i>i.e.,</i>
a �1080i�-resolution picture&#8212;from any source other than DIRECTV. This
claim is flatly untrue; the uncontroverted factual record establishes that
viewers can, in fact, get the same �best picture� by ordering HD programming
from their cable service provider. We therefore affirm the District Court's
determination that the Revised Simpson Commercial's contention �that a viewer
cannot �get the best picture� without DIRECTV is ... likely to be proven
literally false.� <i>Time Warner Cable, Inc.,</i> 475 F.Supp.2d at 306.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>b. Revised Shatner Commercial</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The issue of whether the Revised Shatner Commercial
is likely to be proven literally false requires more analysis. When
interpreting the controversial statement, �With what Starfleet just ponied up
for this big screen TV, settling for cable would be illogical,� the District
Court looked not only at that particular text, but also at the surrounding
context. In light of Shatner's opening comment extolling the �amazing picture
quality of [ ] DIRECTV HD� and the announcer's closing remark highlighting the
unbeatable �HD picture� provided by DIRECTV, the District Court found that the
line in the middle&#8212;�settling for cable would be illogical�&#8212;clearly
referred to cable's HD picture quality. Since it would only be �illogical� to
�settle� for cable's HD picture if it was materially inferior to DIRECTV's HD
picture, the District Court concluded that TWC was likely to establish that the
statement was literally false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV argues that the District Court's ruling was
clearly erroneous because the actual statement at issue, �settling for cable
would be illogical,� does not explicitly compare the picture quality of DIRECTV
<i>HD</i> with that of cable <i>HD,</i> and indeed, does not mention <i>HD</i>
at all. In DIRECTV's view, the District Court based its determination of
literal falsity not on the words actually used, but on what it subjectively
perceived to be the general message conveyed by the commercial as a whole.
DIRECTV contends that this was plainly improper under this Court's decision in <i>American
Home Products Corp. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,</i> 577 F.2d 160 (2d Cir.1978).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TWC, on the other hand, maintains that the District
Court properly took context into account in interpreting the commercial, as
directed by this Court in <i>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. Hertz Corp.,</i>
782 F.2d 381 (2d Cir.1986). TWC argues that under <i>Avis Rent A Car,</i> an
advertisement can be literally false even though no �combination of words
between two punctuation signals� is untrue, if the clear meaning of the
statement, considered in context, is false. Given the commercial's repeated
references to �HD picture,� TWC contends that the District Court correctly
found that �settling for cable would be illogical� literally made the false
claim that cable's HD picture quality is inferior to DIRECTV's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To appreciate the parties' dispute, it is necessary
to understand the two key cases, <i>American Home Products</i> and <i>Avis Rent
A Car.</i> The <i>American Home Products</i> case involved a false advertising
claim asserted by McNeil Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of Tylenol,
against American Home Products Corporation, the manufacturer of the competing
drug Anacin. One of the challenged advertisements was a television commercial,
in which a spokesman told consumers:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Your body knows the difference between these pain relievers
[showing other products] and Adult Strength Anacin. For pain other than
headache Anacin reduces the inflammation that often comes with pain. These do
not. Specifically, inflammation of tooth extraction[,] muscle strain[,]
backache [,] or if your doctor diagnoses tendonitis [,] neuritis. Anacin
reduces that inflammation as Anacin relieves pain fast. These do not. Take
Adult Strength Anacin.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Am. Home Prods.,</i> 577 F.2d at 163 n. 3 (notations
of special effects omitted). Another advertisement, which appeared in national
magazines, advised readers:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Anacin can reduce inflammation
that comes with most pain. Tylenol cannot.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>With any of these pains, your body
knows the difference between the pain reliever in Adult&#8211;Strength Anacin
and other pain relievers like Tylenol. Anacin can reduce the inflammation that
often comes with these pains.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Tylenol cannot. Even
Extra&#8211;Strength Tylenol cannot. And Anacin relieves pain fast as it
reduces inflammation.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 163 n. 4. The print advertisement
visually depicted the aforementioned �pains� as spots located on a human body,
correlating to tooth extraction, muscle strain, muscular backache, tendonitis,
neuritis, sinusitis, and sprains. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To ascertain the meaning of these advertisements,
the district court turned to consumer reaction surveys. <i>See id.</i> at 163.
Based on these surveys, it found that: (1) the television commercial
represented that Anacin is a superior pain reliever generally, and not only
with reference to the particular conditions enumerated in the commercial or to
Anacin's alleged ability to reduce inflammation; (2) the print advertisement
claimed that Anacin is a superior analgesic for certain kinds of pain because
Anacin can reduce inflammation; and (3) both advertisements represented that
Anacin reduces inflammation associated with the conditions specified in the
ads. <i>Id.</i> at 163&#8211;64. The district court determined that the first
two claims were factually false. <i>Id.</i> at 164. Although the district court
did not definitively decide the veracity of the third claim, it reasoned that
�because the three claims [were] �integral and inseparable,� the advertisements
as a whole� violated the Lanham Act. <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations and
citation omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> American Home Products appealed, arguing that since
the advertisements did not contain an <i>express</i> claim for greater
analgesia, they could not violate � 43(a), even if consumers mistakenly
perceived a different and incorrect meaning. <i>See id.</i> This Court
disagreed. It first observed that �[� ] 43(a) of the Lanham Act encompasses
more than literal falsehoods�; implied falsehoods are also prohibited. <i>Id.</i>
at 165. The Court emphasized, however, that when an advertisement relies on
�clever use of innuendo, indirect intimations, and ambiguous suggestions,�
instead of literally false statements, the truth or falsity of the ad �usually
should be tested by the reactions of the public.� <i>Id.</i> It provided
district courts with the following guidance for analyzing a claim of implied
falsity:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A court may, of course, construe and parse the language of
the advertisement. It may have personal reactions as to the defensibility or
indefensibility of the deliberately manipulated words. It may conclude that the
language is far from candid and would never pass muster under tests otherwise
applied&#8212;for example, the Securities Acts' injunction that �thou shalt
disclose�; but the court's reaction is at best not determinative and at worst
irrelevant. <i>The question in such cases is&#8212;what does the person to whom
the advertisement is addressed find to be the message</i>?</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 165&#8211;66 (quoting <i>Am. Brands, Inc.
v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 413 F.Supp. 1352, 1357 (S.D.N.Y.1976)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying these principles to the facts of the case,
the <i>American Home Products</i> Court determined that �the district court's
use of consumer response data was proper� because �the claims of both the
television commercial and the print advertisement [were] ambiguous.� <i>Id.</i>
at 166. �This obscurity,� the Court explained, �[wa]s produced by several
references to �pain� and body sensation accompanying the assertions that Anacin
reduces inflammation.� <i>Id.</i> Therefore, �[a] reader of or listener to
these advertisements could reasonably infer that Anacin is superior to Tylenol
in reducing pain generally (Claim One) and in reducing certain kinds of pain
(Claim Two).� <i>Id.</i> �Given this rather obvious ambiguity,� the Court
concluded that the district judge �was warranted in examining, and may have
been compelled to examine, consumer data to determine first the messages
conveyed in order to determine ultimately the truth or falsity of the
messages.� <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>American Home Products</i> dealt with a claim of
implied falsity. <i>See id.</i> at 165 (�We are dealing not with statements
which are literally or grammatically untrue.... Rather, we are asked to
determine whether a statement acknowledged to be <i>literally true and
grammatically correct nevertheless has a tendency to mislead, confuse or
deceive.</i>� (quoting <i>Am. Brands, Inc.,</i> 413 F.Supp. at 1357)). In <i>Avis
Rent A Car,</i> the false advertising action was premised on a theory of
literal, not implied, falsity. In the facts of that case, Avis Rent A Car
System, Inc., the self-proclaimed �Number 2� in the car rental business, sued
�Number 1� Hertz Corporation over an advertisement that proclaimed, in large
bold print, that �<b>Hertz has more new cars than Avis has cars.</b>� <i>Avis
Rent A Car,</i> 782 F.2d at 381&#8211;82. Below a picture of mechanics
unloading new cars into an airport parking lot, the advertisement went on to
explain: �If you'd like to drive some of the newest cars on the road, rent from
Hertz. Because we have more new 1984 cars than Avis or anyone else has
cars&#8212;new or old.... Whether you're renting for business or pleasure,
chances are you'll find a domestic or imported car you'll want to drive.� <i>Id.</i>
at 382. At the bottom of the ad was Hertz's slogan, �<b><i>The # 1 way to rent
a car.</i>�</b> <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the time the advertisement was published, Hertz
only had about 97,000 1984 model cars, whereas Avis had a total of
approximately 102,000 cars. <i>See id.</i> at 383. However, 6776 cars in Avis's
fleet were in the process of being sold and were no longer available for
rental. <i>Id.</i> at 384. Thus, the literal truth or falsity of the claim that
�Hertz has more new cars than Avis has cars� turned on whether the statement
�referred to the rental fleets or the total fleets of the two companies.� <i>Id.</i>
at 383. The district court found that because the advertisement said �cars,�
and not �cars for rent,� it had to be read as referring to the companies' total
fleets and, as such, was literally false. <i>See id.</i> at 384.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This Court held that the district court's finding
was clearly erroneous. It pointed out that the parties had �made their
reputations as companies that <i>rent</i> cars, not companies that sell or
merely own cars,� and that the advertisement had appeared �in publications that
would come to the attention of prospective renters, not car buyers or financial
analysts.� <i>Id.</i> at 385. Moreover, the advertisement featured a large
picture of an airport rental lot and made three specific references to rentals.
<i>See id.</i> Taking this context into consideration, the Court concluded that
the claim that �Hertz has more new cars than Avis has new cars� could only be
understood as referring to the companies' rental fleets. The Court elaborated:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Fundamental to any task of
interpretation is the principle that text must yield to context. Recognizing
this, the Supreme Court long ago inveighed against �the tyranny of
literalness.� In his determination to �go by the written word� and to ignore
the context in which the words were used, the district judge in the present
case failed to heed the familiar warning of Judge Learned Hand that �[t]here is
no surer way to misread any document than to read it literally,� as well as his
oft-cited admonition that �it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and
developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary.�</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>These and similar invocations
against literalness, though delivered most often in connection with statutory
and contract interpretation, are relevant to the interpretation of any writing,
including advertisements. Thus, we have emphasized that in reviewing FTC
actions prohibiting unfair advertising practices under the Federal Trade
Commission Act a court must �consider the advertisement in its entirety and not
... engage in disputatious dissection. The entire mosaic should be viewed
rather than each tile separately.� ... Similar approaches have been taken in
Lanham Act cases involving the claim that an advertisement was false on its
face.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 385 (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At first glance, <i>American Home Products</i> and <i>Avis
Rent A Car</i> may appear to conflict. <i>American Home Products</i> counsels
that when an advertisement is not false on its face, but instead relies on
indirect intimations, district courts should look to consumer reaction to
determine meaning, and not rest on their subjective impressions of the
advertisement as a whole. <i>Avis Rent A Car,</i> on the other hand, instructs
district courts to consider the overall context of an advertisement to discern
its true meaning, and holds that the message conveyed by an advertisement may
be viewed as not false in the context of the business at issue, even though the
written words are not literally accurate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On closer reading, however, the two cases can be
reconciled. In <i>American Home Products,</i> we did not say that context is
irrelevant or that courts are myopically bound to the explicit words of an
advertisement. Rather, we held that where it is �clear that ... the language of
the advertisement[ ] is not unambiguous,� the district court should look to
consumer response data to resolve the ambiguity. <i>Am. Home Prods.,</i> 577
F.2d at 164. In <i>Avis Rent A Car,</i> we concluded that there was no
ambiguity to resolve because even though the statement, �Hertz has more new
cars than Avis has cars,� did not expressly qualify the comparison, given the
surrounding context, it �unmistakably� referred to the companies' rental
fleets. <i>Avis Rent A Car,</i> 782 F.2d at 384.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These two cases, read together, compel us to now
formally adopt what is known in other circuits as the �false by necessary
implication� doctrine. <i>See, e.g., Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp.,</i> 315
F.3d 264, 274 (4th Cir.2002); <i>Clorox Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor &amp; Gamble
Commercial Co.,</i> 228 F.3d 24, 34&#8211;35 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Southland Sod
Farms v. Stover Seed Co.,</i> 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.1997); <i>Castrol
Inc. v. Pennzoil Co.,</i> 987 F.2d 939, 946&#8211;47 (3d Cir.1993) (�<i>Pennzoil

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[4]</span></span></span></a>
Under this doctrine, a district court evaluating whether an advertisement is
literally false �must analyze the message conveyed in full context,� <i>Pennzoil
Co.,</i> 987 F.2d at 946, <i>i.e.,</i> it �must consider the advertisement in
its entirety and not ... engage in disputatious dissection,� <i>Avis Rent A
Car,</i> 782 F.2d at 385 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the words or
images, considered in context, necessarily imply a false message, the
advertisement is literally false and no extrinsic evidence of consumer
confusion is required. <i>See Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson &amp;
Johnson&#8211;Merck Pharm. Co.,</i> 290 F.3d 578, 586&#8211;87 (3d Cir.2002)
(�A �literally false� message may be either explicit or �conveyed by necessary
implication when, considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience
would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.� �
(quoting <i>Clorox Co. Puerto Rico,</i> 228 F.3d at 35)). However, �only an <i>unambiguous</i>
message can be literally false.� <i>Id.</i> at 587. Therefore, if the language
or graphic is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the
advertisement cannot be literally false. <i>See Scotts Co.,</i> 315 F.3d at 275
(stating that a literal falsity argument fails if the statement or image �can
reasonably be understood as conveying different messages�); <i>Clorox Co.
Puerto Rico,</i> 228 F.3d at 35 (�[A] factfinder might conclude that the
message conveyed by a particular advertisement remains so balanced between
several plausible meanings that the claim made by the advertisement is too
uncertain to serve as the basis of a literal falsity claim....�). There may
still be a �basis for a claim that the advertisement is misleading,� <i>Clorox
Co. Puerto Rico,</i> 228 F.3d at 35, but to resolve such a claim, the district
court must look to consumer data to determine what �the person to whom the
advertisement is addressed find[s] to be the message,� <i>Am. Home Prods.,</i>
577 F.2d at 166 (citation omitted). In short, where the advertisement does not
unambiguously make a claim, �the court's reaction is at best not determinative
and at worst irrelevant.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, the District Court found that Shatner's
assertion that �settling for cable would be illogical,� considered in light of
the advertisement as a whole, unambiguously made the false claim that cable's
HD picture quality is inferior to that of DIRECTV's. We cannot say that this
finding was clearly erroneous, especially given that in the immediately
preceding line, Shatner praises the �amazing picture clarity of DIRECTV HD.� We
accordingly affirm the District Court's conclusion that TWC established a
likelihood of success on its claim that the Revised Shatner Commercial is
literally false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span>2. Internet Advertisements</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have made clear that a district court must
examine not only the words, but also the �visual images ... to assess whether
[the advertisement] is literally false.� <i>S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.,</i>
241 F.3d at 238. It is uncontroverted that the images used in the Internet
Advertisements to represent cable are inaccurate depictions of the picture
quality provided by cable's digital or analog service. The Internet
Advertisements are therefore explicitly and literally false. <i>See
Coca&#8211;Cola Co.,</i> 690 F.2d at 318 (reversing the district court's
finding of no literal falsity in an orange juice commercial where �[t]he visual
component of the ad makes an explicit representation that Premium Pack is
produced by squeezing oranges and pouring the freshly-squeezed juice directly
into the carton. This is not a true representation of how the product is
prepared. Premium Pack juice is heated and sometimes frozen prior to
packaging.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> DIRECTV does not contest this point. Rather, it
asserts that the images are so grossly distorted and exaggerated that no
reasonable buyer would take them to be accurate depictions �of how a consumer's
television picture would look when connected to cable.� Consequently, DIRECTV
argues, the images are obviously just puffery, which cannot form the basis of a
Lanham Act violation. Notably, TWC agrees that no Lanham Act action would lie
against an advertisement that was so exaggerated that no reasonable consumer
would rely on it in making his or her purchasing decisions. TWC contends,
however, that DIRECTV's own evidence&#8212;which indicates that consumers are
highly confused about HD technology&#8212;shows that the Internet
Advertisements pose a real danger of consumer reliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This Court has had little occasion to explore the
concept of puffery in the false advertising context. In <i>Lipton v. Nature
Co.,</i> 71 F.3d 464 (2d Cir.1995), the one case where we discussed the subject
in some depth, we characterized puffery as �[s]ubjective claims about products,
which cannot be proven either true or false.� <i>Id.</i> at 474 (internal
quotation marks omitted). We also cited to the Third Circuit's description of
puffery in <i>Pennzoil Co.:</i> �Puffery is an exaggeration or overstatement
expressed in broad, vague, and commendatory language. �Such sales talk, or
puffing, as it is commonly called, is considered to be offered and understood
as an expression of the seller's opinion only, which is to be discounted as
such by the buyer.... The �puffing� rule amounts to a seller's privilege to lie
his head off, so long as he says nothing specific.' � <i>Pennzoil Co.,</i> 987
F.2d at 945 (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of
Torts</i> � 109, at 756&#8211;57 (5th ed.1984)). Applying this definition, we
concluded that the defendant's contention that he had conducted �thorough� research
was just puffery, which was not actionable under the Lanham Act. <i>See Lipton,</i>
71 F.3d at 474.</p>

definition of puffery does not translate well into the world of images. Unlike
words, images cannot be vague or broad. <i>Cf. Pennzoil Co.,</i> 987 F.2d at
945. To the contrary, visual depictions of a product are generally �specific
and measurable,� <i>id.</i> at 946, and can therefore �be proven either true or
false,� <i>Lipton,</i> 71 F.3d at 474 (internal quotation marks omitted), as
this case demonstrates. Yet, if a visual representation is so grossly
exaggerated that no reasonable buyer would take it at face value, there is no
danger of consumer deception and hence, no basis for a false advertising claim.
<i>Cf. Johnson &amp; Johnson Merck Consumer Pharm. Co. v. Smithkline Beecham
Corp.,</i> 960 F.2d 294, 298 (2d Cir.1992) (�[T]he injuries redressed in false
advertising cases are the result of public deception. Thus, where the plaintiff
cannot demonstrate that a statistically significant part of the commercial
audience holds the false belief allegedly communicated by the challenged
advertisement, the plaintiff cannot establish that it suffered any injury as a
result of the advertisement's message. Without injury there can be no claim,
regardless of commercial context, prior advertising history, or audience
sophistication.�); <i>see also U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue Cross of Greater
Philadelphia,</i> 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir.1990) (�Mere puffery, advertising

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Other circuits have recognized that puffery can come
in at least two different forms. <i>See, e.g., Pizza Hut, Inc. v. Papa John's
Int'l, Inc.,</i> 227 F.3d 489, 497 (5th Cir.2000). The first form we identified
in <i>Lipton</i>&#8212;�a general claim of superiority over comparable products
that is so vague that it can be understood as nothing more than a mere
expression of opinion.� <i>Id.; see Lipton,</i> 71 F.3d at 474. The second form
of puffery, which we did not address in <i>Lipton,</i> is �an exaggerated,
blustering, and boasting statement upon which no reasonable buyer would be
justified in relying.� <i>Pizza Hut, Inc.,</i> 227 F.3d at 497; <i>accord
United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co.,</i> 140 F.3d 1175, 1180 (8th Cir.1998)
(�Puffery is exaggerated advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no
reasonable buyer would rely and is not actionable under � 43(a).� (internal
quotation marks omitted)). We believe that this second conception of puffery is
a better fit where, as here, the �statement� at issue is expressed not in
words, but through images.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The District Court determined that the Internet
Advertisements did not satisfy this alternative definition of puffery because
DIRECTV's own evidence showed that �many HDTV equipment purchasers are confused
as to what image quality to expect when viewing non-HD broadcasts, as their
prior experience with the equipment is often limited to viewing HD broadcasts
or other digital images on floor model televisions at large retail chains.� <i>Time
Warner Cable, Inc.,</i> 475 F.Supp.2d at 307. Given this confusion, the
District Court reasoned that �consumers unfamiliar with HD equipment could be
led to believe that using an HD television set with an analog cable feed might
result in the sort of distorted images showcased in DIRECTV's Internet
Advertisements, especially since those advertisements make reference to �basic
cable.� � <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our review of the record persuades us that the
District Court clearly erred in rejecting DIRECTV's puffery defense. The �OTHER
TV� images in the Internet Advertisements are&#8212;to borrow the words of
Ronald Boyer, TWC's Senior Network Engineer&#8212;�unwatchably blurry,
distorted, and pixelated, and ... nothing like the images a customer would
ordinarily see using Time Warner Cable's cable service.� Boyer further
explained that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>the types of gross distortions shown in DIRECTV's Website
Demonstrative and Banner Ads are not the type of disruptions that could
naturally happen to an analog or non-HD digital cable picture. These
advertisements depict the picture quality of cable television as a series of
large colored square blocks, laid out in a grid like graph paper, which nearly
entirely obscure the image. This is not the type of wavy or �snowy� picture
that might occur from degradation of an unconverted analog cable picture, or
the type of macro-blocking or �pixelization� that might occur from degradation
of a digital cable picture. Rather, the patchwork of colored blocks that
DIRECTV depicts in its advertisement appears to be the type of distortion that
would result if someone took a low-resolution photograph and enlarged it too
much or zoomed in too close. If DIRECTV intended the advertisement to depict a
pixelization problem, this is a gross exaggeration of one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Boyer's declaration establishes, the Internet
Advertisements' depictions of cable are not just inaccurate; they are not even
remotely realistic. It is difficult to imagine that any consumer, whatever the
level of sophistication, would actually be fooled by the Internet Advertisements
into thinking that cable's picture quality is so poor that the image is �nearly
entirely obscure [d].� As DIRECTV states in its brief, �even a person not
acquainted with cable would realize TWC could not realistically supply an
unwatchably blurry image and survive in the marketplace.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In reaching the contrary conclusion, the District
Court relied heavily on the declaration of Jon Gieselman, DIRECTV's Senior
Vice&#8211;President of Advertising and Public Relations. However, Gieselman
merely stated that the common misconception amongst first-time purchasers of HD
televisions is that �they will automatically get exceptional clarity on every
channel� just by plugging their new television sets into the wall. Nothing in
Gieselman's declaration indicates that consumers mistakenly believe that
hooking up their HD televisions to an analog cable feed will produce an
unwatchably distorted picture. More importantly, the Internet Advertisements do
not claim that the �OTHER TV� is an HD television set, or that the
corresponding images represent what happens when an HD television is connected
to basic cable. The Internet Advertisements simply purport to compare the
picture quality of DIRECTV's programming to that of basic cable programming,
and as discussed above, the comparison is so obviously hyperbolic that �no
reasonable buyer would be justified in relying� on it in navigating the
marketplace. <i>Pizza Hut, Inc.,</i> 227 F.3d at 497.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For these reasons, we conclude that the District
Court exceeded its permissible discretion in preliminarily enjoining DIRECTV
from disseminating the Internet Advertisements.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>E. GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This appeal presents a false advertising claim
under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, resulting in a jury verdict for the
plaintiff, Pizza Hut. At the center of this appeal is Papa John's four word
slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The appellant, Papa John's International Inc.
(�Papa John's�), argues that the slogan �cannot and does not violate the Lanham
Act� because it is �not a misrepresentation of fact.� The appellee, Pizza Hut,
Inc., argues that the slogan, when viewed in the context of Papa John's overall
advertising campaign, conveys a false statement of fact actionable under
section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. The district court, after evaluating the
jury's responses to a series of special interrogatories and denying Papa John's
motion for judgment as a matter of law, entered judgment for Pizza Hut stating:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>When the �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� slogan is
considered in light of the entirety of Papa John's post-May 1997 advertising
which violated provisions of the Lanham Act and in the context in which it was
juxtaposed with the false and misleading statements contained in Papa John's
print and broadcast media advertising, the slogan itself became tainted to the extent
that its continued use should be enjoined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We conclude that (1) the slogan, standing alone, is not an
objectifiable statement of fact upon which consumers would be justified in
relying, and thus not actionable under section 43(a); and (2) while the slogan,
when utilized in connection with some of the post-May 1997 comparative
advertising&#8212;specifically, the sauce and dough campaigns&#8212;conveyed
objectifiable and misleading facts, Pizza Hut has failed to adduce any evidence
demonstrating that the facts conveyed by the slogan were material to the
purchasing decisions of the consumers to which the slogan was directed. Thus,
the district court erred in denying Papa John's motion for judgment as a matter
of law. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court denying Papa
John's motion for judgment as a matter of law, vacate its final judgment, and
remand the case to the district court for entry of judgment for Papa John's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Pizza Hut is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tricon
Global Restaurants. With over 7000 restaurants (both company and
franchisee-owned), Pizza Hut is the largest pizza chain in the United States.
In 1984, John Schnatter founded Papa John's Pizza in the back of his father's
tavern. Papa John's has grown to over 2050 locations, making it the third
largest pizza chain in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In May 1995, Papa John's adopted a new slogan:
�Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� In 1996, Papa John's filed for a federal
trademark registration for this slogan with the United States Patent &amp;
Trademark Office (�PTO�). Its application for registration was ultimately
granted by the PTO. Since 1995, Papa John's has invested over $300 million
building customer goodwill in its trademark �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.�
The slogan has appeared on millions of signs, shirts, menus, pizza boxes,
napkins and other items, and has regularly appeared as the �tag line� at the
end of Papa John's radio and television ads, or with the company logo in
printed advertising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On May 1, 1997, Pizza Hut launched its �Totally New
Pizza� campaign. This campaign was the culmination of �Operation Lightning
Bolt,� a nine-month, $50 million project in which Pizza Hut declared �war� on
poor quality pizza. From the deck of a World War II aircraft carrier, Pizza
Hut's president, David Novak, declared �war� on �skimpy, low quality pizza.�
National ads aired during this campaign touted the �better taste� of Pizza
Hut's pizza, and �dared� anyone to find a �better pizza.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In early May 1997, Papa John's launched its first
national ad campaign. The campaign was directed towards Pizza Hut, and its
�Totally New Pizza� campaign. In a pair of TV ads featuring Pizza Hut's
co-founder Frank Carney, Carney touted the superiority of Papa John's pizza
over Pizza Hut's pizza. Although Carney had left the pizza business in the
1980's, he returned as a franchisee of Papa John's because he liked the taste
of Papa John's pizza better than any other pizza on the market. The ad campaign
was remarkably successful. During May 1997, Papa John's sales increased 11.7
percent over May 1996 sales, while Pizza Hut's sales were down 8 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the heels of the success of the Carney ads, in
February 1998, Papa John's launched a second series of ads touting the results
of a taste test in which consumers were asked to compare Papa John's and Pizza
Hut's pizzas. In the ads, Papa John's boasted that it �won big time� in taste
tests. The ads were a response to Pizza Hut's �dare� to find a �better pizza.�
The taste test showed that consumers preferred Papa John's traditional crust
pizzas over Pizza Hut's comparable pizzas by a 16&#8211;point margin (58% to
42%). Additionally, consumers preferred Papa John's thin crust pizzas by a
fourteen-point margin (57% to 43%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Following the taste test ads, Papa John's ran a
series of ads comparing specific ingredients used in its pizzas with those used
by its �competitors.� During the course of these ads, Papa John's touted the
superiority of its sauce and its dough. During the sauce campaign, Papa John's
asserted that its sauce was made from �fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes,� which
were canned through a process called �fresh pack,� while its
competitors&#8212;including Pizza Hut&#8212;make their sauce from remanufactured
tomato paste. During the dough campaign, Papa John's stated that it used �clear
filtered water� to make its pizza dough, while the �biggest chain� uses
�whatever comes out of the tap.� Additionally, Papa John's asserted that it
gives its yeast �several days to work its magic,� while �some folks� use
�frozen dough or dough made the same day.� At or near the close of each of
these ads, Papa John's punctuated its ingredient comparisons with the slogan
�Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Pizza Hut does not appear to contest the
truthfulness of the underlying factual assertions made by Papa John's in the
course of these ads. Pizza Hut argues, however, that its own independent taste
tests and other �scientific evidence� establishes that filtered water makes no
difference in pizza dough, that there is no �taste� difference between Papa
John's �fresh-pack� sauce and Pizza Hut's �remanufactured� sauce, and that
fresh dough is not superior to frozen dough. In response to Pizza Hut's
�scientific evidence,� Papa John's asserts that �each of these �claims'
involves a matter of common sense choice (fresh versus frozen, canned
vegetables and fruit versus remanufactured paste, and filtered versus unfiltered
water) about which individual consumers can and do form preferences every day
without �scientific� or �expert� assistance.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In November 1997, Pizza Hut filed a complaint
regarding Papa John's �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� advertising campaign
with the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau, an
industry self-regulatory body. This complaint, however, did not produce
satisfactory results for Pizza Hut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On August 12, 1998, Pizza Hut filed a civil action
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas charging
Papa John's with false advertising in violation of Section 43(a)(1)(B) of the
Lanham Act. The suit sought relief based on the above-described TV ad
campaigns, as well as on some 249 print ads. On March 10, 1999, Pizza Hut filed
an amended complaint. Papa John's answered the complaints by denying that its
advertising and slogan violated the Lanham Act. Additionally, Papa John's
asserted a counterclaim, charging Pizza Hut with engaging in false advertising.
The parties consented to a jury trial before a United States magistrate judge.
The parties further agreed that the liability issues were to be decided by the
jury, while the equitable injunction claim and damages award were within the
province of the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The trial began on October 26, 1999, and continued
for over three weeks. At the close of Pizza Hut's case, and at the close of all
evidence, Papa John's moved for a judgment as a matter of law. The motions were
denied each time. The district court, without objection, submitted the
liability issue to the jury through special interrogatories.<a href="#_ftn5"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

to the jury related to (1) the slogan and (2) over Papa John's objection,
certain classes of groups of advertisements referred to as �sauce claims,�
�dough claims,� �taste test claims,� and �ingredients claims.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On November 17, 1999, the jury returned its
responses to the special issues finding that Papa John's slogan, and its �sauce
claims� and �dough claims� were false or misleading and deceptive or likely to
deceive consumers.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

not false or misleading.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

style='color:gray'>]</span> On January 3, 2000, the trial court, based upon the
jury's verdict and the evidence presented by the parties in support of
injunctive relief and on the issue of damages, entered a Final Judgment and
issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order. The court concluded that the �Better
Ingredients. Better Pizza.� slogan was �consistent with the legal definition of
non-actionable puffery� from its introduction in 1995 until May 1997. However,
the slogan �became tainted ... in light of the entirety of Papa John's post-May
1997 advertising.� Based on this conclusion, the magistrate judge permanently
enjoined Papa John's from �using any slogan in the future that constitutes a
recognizable variation of the phrase �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� or
which uses the adjective �Better� to modify the terms �ingredients' and/or
�pizza�.� Additionally, the court enjoined Papa John's from identifying Frank
Carney as a co-founder of Pizza Hut, �unless such advertising includes a
voice-over, printed statement or a superimposed message which states that Frank
Carney has not been affiliated with Pizza Hut since 1980,� and enjoined the
dissemination of any advertising that was produced or disseminated prior to the
date of this judgment and that explicitly or implicitly states or suggested
that �Papa John's component is superior to the same component of Pizza Hut's
pizzas.� Finally, the court enjoined Papa John's from �explicitly or implicitly
claim[ing] that a component of Papa John's pizza is superior to the same
component of Pizza Hut's unless the superiority claim is supported by either
(1) scientifically demonstrated attributes of superiority or (2) taste test
surveys.� Additionally, the injunction required that if the claim is supported
by taste test surveys, the advertising shall include a printed statement,
voice-over or �super,� whichever is appropriate, stating the localities where
the tests were conducted, the inclusive dates on which the surveys were
performed, and the specific pizza products that were tested. The court also
awarded Pizza Hut $467,619.75 in damages for having to run corrective ads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span

opinion under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act has been referred to as
�puffery.� Puffery has been discussed at some length by other circuits. The
Third Circuit has described �puffing� as �advertising that is not deceptive for
no one would rely on its exaggerated claims.� <i>U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue
Cross of Greater Philadelphia,</i> 898 F.2d 914 (3d Cir.1990). Similarly, the
Ninth Circuit has defined �puffing� as �exaggerated advertising, blustering and
boasting upon which no reasonable buyer would rely and is not actionable under
43(a).� <i>Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co.,</i> 108 F.3d 1134, 1145 (9th
Cir.1997) (quoting 3 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition � 27.04[4][d] (3d ed.1994)); <i>see also Cook,</i> 911 F.2d at 246
(stating that �[p]uffing has been described by most courts as involving outrageous
generalized statements, not making specific claims, that are so exaggerated as
to preclude reliance by consumers�).<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These definitions of puffery are consistent with
the definitions provided by the leading commentaries in trademark law. A
leading authority on unfair competition has defined �puffery� as an
�exaggerated advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no reasonable
buyer would rely,� or �a general claim of superiority over a comparative
product that is so vague, it would be understood as a mere expression of
opinion.� 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademark and Unfair Competition �

Similarly, Prosser and Keeton on Torts defines �puffing� as �a seller's
privilege to lie his head off, so long as he says nothing specific, on the
theory that no reasonable man would believe him, or that no reasonable man
would be influenced by such talk.� W. Page Keeton, et al., Prosser and Keeton

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Drawing guidance from the writings of our sister
circuits and the leading commentators, we think that non-actionable �puffery�
comes in at least two possible forms: (1) an exaggerated, blustering, and
boasting statement upon which no reasonable buyer would be justified in
relying; or (2) a general claim of superiority over comparable products that is
so vague that it can be understood as nothing more than a mere expression of
opinion.</p>

produce evidence of actual consumer reaction to the challenged advertising or

<p class=Centered>IV</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We turn now to consider the case before us. Reduced
to its essence, the question is whether the evidence, viewed in the most
favorable light to Pizza Hut, established that Papa John's slogan �Better
Ingredients. Better Pizza.� is misleading and violative of section 43(a) of the
Lanham Act. In making this determination, we will first consider the slogan
�Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� standing alone to determine if it is a
statement of fact capable of deceiving a substantial segment of the consuming
public to which it was directed. Second, we will determine whether the evidence
supports the district court's conclusion that after May 1997, the slogan was
tainted, and therefore actionable, as a result of its use in a series of ads
comparing specific ingredients used by Papa John's with the ingredients used by
its �competitors.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The jury concluded that the slogan itself was a
�false or misleading� statement of fact, and the district court enjoined its
further use. Papa John's argues, however, that this statement �quite simply is
not a statement of fact, [but] rather, a statement of belief or opinion, and an
argumentative one at that.� Papa John's asserts that because �a statement of
fact is either true or false, it is susceptible to being proved or disproved. A
statement of opinion or belief, on the other hand, conveys the speaker's state
of mind, and even though it may be used to attempt to persuade the listener, it
is a subjective communication that may be accepted or rejected, but not proven
true or false.� Papa John's contends that its slogan �Better Ingredients.
Better Pizza.� falls into the latter category, and because the phrases �better
ingredients� and �better pizza� are not subject to quantifiable measures, the
slogan is non-actionable puffery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We will therefore consider whether the slogan
standing alone constitutes a statement of fact under the Lanham Act. Bisecting
the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.,� it is clear that the assertion
by Papa John's that it makes a �Better Pizza.� is a general statement of
opinion regarding the superiority of its product over all others. This simple
statement, �Better Pizza.,� epitomizes the exaggerated advertising, blustering,
and boasting by a manufacturer upon which no consumer would reasonably rely. <i>See,
e.g., In re Boston Beer Co.,</i> 198 F.3d 1370, 1372 (Fed.Cir.1999)(stating
that the phrase �The Best Beer in America� was �trade puffery� and that such a
general claim of superiority �should be freely available to all competitors in
any given field to refer to their products or services�); <i>Atari Corp. v. 3D0
Co.,</i> 1994 WL 723601, *2 (N.D.Cal.1994)(stating that a manufacturer's slogan
that its product was �the most advanced home gaming system in the universe� was
non-actionable puffery); <i>Nikkal Indus., Ltd. v. Salton, Inc.,</i> 735
F.Supp. 1227, 1234 n. 3 (S.D.N.Y.1990)(stating that a manufacturers claim that
its ice cream maker was �better� than competition ice cream makers is
non-actionable puffery). Consequently, it appears indisputable that Papa John's
assertion �Better Pizza.� is non-actionable puffery.<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moving next to consider separately the phrase
�Better Ingredients.,� the same conclusion holds true. Like �Better Pizza.,� it
is typical puffery. The word �better,� when used in this context is
unquantifiable. What makes one food ingredient �better� than another comparable
ingredient, without further description, is wholly a matter of individual taste
or preference not subject to scientific quantification. Indeed, it is difficult
to think of any product, or any component of any product, to which the term
�better,� without more, is quantifiable. As our court stated in <i>Presidio:</i></p>

<p class=Blockquote>The law recognizes that a vendor is allowed some latitude
in claiming merits of his wares by way of an opinion rather than an absolute
guarantee, so long as he hews to the line of rectitude in matters of fact.
Opinions are not only the lifestyle of democracy, they are the brag in
advertising that has made for the wide dissemination of products that otherwise
would never have reached the households of our citizens. If we were to accept
the thesis set forth by the appellees, [that all statements by advertisers were
statements of fact actionable under the Lanham Act,] the advertising industry
would have to be liquidated in short order.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Presidio,</i> 784 F.2d at 685. Thus, it is equally
clear that Papa John's assertion that it uses �Better Ingredients.� is one of
opinion not actionable under the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, turning to the combination of the two
non-actionable phrases as the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.,� we
fail to see how the mere joining of these two statements of opinion could
create an actionable statement of fact. Each half of the slogan amounts to
little more than an exaggerated opinion of superiority that no consumer would
be justified in relying upon. It has not been explained convincingly to us how
the combination of the two phrases, without more, changes the essential nature
of each phrase so as to make it actionable. We assume that �Better
Ingredients.� modifies �Better Pizza.� and consequently gives some expanded
meaning to the phrase �Better Pizza,� i.e., our pizza is better because our
ingredients are better. Nevertheless, the phrase fails to give �Better Pizza.�
any more quantifiable meaning. Stated differently, the adjective that continues
to describe �pizza� is �better,� a term that remains unquantifiable, especially
when applied to the sense of taste. Consequently, the slogan as a whole is a
statement of non-actionable opinion. Thus, there is no legally sufficient basis
to support the jury's finding that the slogan standing alone is a �false or
misleading� statement of fact. </p>

<p class=Centered>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We next will consider whether the use of the slogan
�Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� in connection with a series of comparative
ads found by the jury to be misleading&#8212;specifically, ads comparing Papa
John's sauce and dough with the sauce and dough of its
competitors&#8212;�tainted� the statement of opinion and made it misleading
under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. Before reaching the ultimate question of
whether the slogan is actionable under the Lanham Act, we will first examine
the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's conclusion that the
comparison ads were misleading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>(1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After the jury returned its verdict, Papa John's
filed a post-verdict motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 for a
judgment as a matter of law. In denying Papa John's motion, the district court,
while apparently recognizing that the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better
Pizza.� standing alone is non-actionable puffery under the Lanham Act,
concluded that after<b> </b>May 1997, the slogan was transformed as a result of
its use in connection with a series of ads that the jury found misleading.
These ads had compared specific ingredients used by Papa John's with the
ingredients used by its competitors.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[13]</span></span></span></a>
In essence, the district court held that the comparison ads in which the slogan
appeared as the tag line gave objective, quantifiable, and fact-specific
meaning to the slogan. Consequently, the court concluded that the slogan was
misleading and actionable under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and enjoined
its further use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>(2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We are obligated to accept the findings of the jury
unless the facts point so overwhelmingly in favor of one party that no
reasonable person could arrive at a different conclusion. <i>See Scottish
Heritable Trust v. Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 606, 610 (5th
Cir.1996). In examining the record evidence, we must view it the way that is
most favorable to upholding the verdict. <i>See Hiltgen v. Sumrall,</i> 47 F.3d
695, 700 (5th Cir.1995). Viewed in this light, it is clear that there is
sufficient evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the sauce and dough
ads were misleading statements of fact actionable under the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Turning first to the sauce ads, the evidence
establishes that despite the differences in the methods used to produce their
competing sauces: (1) the primary ingredient in both Pizza Hut and Papa John's
sauce is vine-ripened tomatoes; (2) at the point that the competing sauces are
placed on the pizza, just prior to putting the pies into the oven for cooking,
the consistency and water content of the sauces are essentially identical; and
(3) as noted by the district court, at no time �prior to the close of the liability
phase of trial was any credible evidence presented [by Papa John's] to
demonstrate the existence of demonstrable differences� in the competing sauces.
Consequently, the district court was correct in concluding that: �Without any
scientific support or properly conducted taste preference test, by the written
and/or oral negative connotations conveyed that pizza made from tomato paste
concentrate is inferior to the �fresh pack� method used by Papa John's, its
sauce advertisements conveyed an impression which is misleading....� Turning
our focus to the dough ads, while the evidence clearly established that Papa
John's and Pizza Hut employ different methods in making their pizza dough,
again, the evidence established that there is no quantifiable difference
between pizza dough produced through the �cold or slow-fermentation method�
(used by Papa John's), or the �frozen dough method� (used by Pizza Hut).<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[14]</span></span></span></a> Further, although there is
some evidence indicating that the texture of the dough used by Papa John's and
Pizza Hut is slightly different, this difference is not related to the
manufacturing process used to produce the dough. Instead, it is due to a
difference in the wheat used to make the dough. Finally, with respect to the
differences in the pizza dough resulting from the use of filtered water as
opposed to tap water, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that
there is no quantifiable difference between dough produced with tap water, as
opposed to dough produced with filtered water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We should note again that Pizza Hut does not
contest the truthfulness of the underlying factual assertions made by Papa
John's in the course of the sauce and dough ads. Pizza Hut concedes that it
uses �remanufactured� tomato sauce to make its pizza sauce, while Papa John's
uses �fresh-pack.� Further, in regard to the dough, Pizza Hut concedes the
truth of the assertion that it uses tap water in making its pizza dough, which
is often frozen, while Papa John's uses filtered water to make its dough, which
is fresh&#8212;never frozen. Consequently, because Pizza Hut does not contest
the factual basis of Papa John's factual assertions, such assertions cannot be
found to be factually false, but only impliedly false or misleading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, we conclude by saying that although the ads
were true about the ingredients Papa John's used, it is clear that there was
sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's conclusion that Papa
John's sauce and dough ads were misleading&#8212;but not false&#8212;in their
suggestion that Papa John's ingredients were superior.</p>

<p class=Centered>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>(3)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, having concluded that the record supports a
finding that the sauce and dough ads are misleading statements of fact, we must
now determine whether the district court was correct in concluding that the use
of the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� in conjunction with these
misleading ads gave quantifiable meaning to the slogan making a general
statement of opinion misleading within the meaning of the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In support of the district court's conclusion that
the slogan was transformed, Pizza Hut argues that �in construing any
advertising statement, the statement must be considered in the overall context
in which it appears.� Building on the foundation of this basic legal principle,
<i>see Avis,</i> 782 F.2d at 385, Pizza Hut argues that �[t]he context in which
Papa John's slogan must be viewed is the 2 1/2 year campaign during which its
advertising served as �chapters' to demonstrate the truth of the �Better
Ingredients. Better Pizza.� book.� Pizza Hut argues, that because Papa John's gave
consumers specific facts supporting its assertion that its sauce and dough are
�better�&#8212;specific facts that the evidence, when viewed in the light most
favorable to the verdict, are irrelevant in making a better pizza&#8212;Papa
John's statement of opinion that it made a �Better Pizza� became misleading. In
essence, Pizza Hut argues, that by using the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better
Pizza.� in combination with the ads comparing Papa John's sauce and dough with
the sauce and dough of its competitions, Papa John's gave quantifiable meaning
to the word �Better� rendering it actionable under section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree that the message communicated by the
slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� is expanded and given additional
meaning when it is used as the tag line in the misleading sauce and dough ads.
The slogan, when used in combination with the comparison ads, gives consumers
two fact-specific reasons why Papa John's ingredients are �better.�
Consequently, a reasonable consumer would understand the slogan, <i>when
considered in the context of the comparison ads,</i> as conveying the following
message: Papa John's uses �better ingredients,� which produces a �better pizza�
because Papa John's uses �fresh-pack� tomatoes, fresh dough, and filtered
water. In short, Papa John's has given definition to the word �better.� Thus,
when the slogan is used in this context, it is no longer mere opinion, but
rather takes on the characteristics of a statement of fact. When used in the
context of the sauce and dough ads, the slogan is misleading for the same
reasons we have earlier discussed in connection with the sauce and dough ads.<a

<p class=Centered>(4)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Concluding that when the slogan was used as the tag
line in the sauce and dough ads it became misleading, we must now determine
whether reasonable consumers would have a tendency to rely on this misleading
statement of fact in making their purchasing decisions. We conclude that Pizza
Hut has failed to adduce evidence establishing that the misleading statement of
fact conveyed by the ads and the slogan was material to the consumers to which
the slogan was directed. Consequently, because such evidence of materiality is
necessary to establish liability under the Lanham Act, the district court erred
in denying Papa John's motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As previously discussed, none of the underlying
facts supporting Papa John's claims of ingredient superiority made in
connection with the slogan were literally false. Consequently, in order to
satisfy its prima facie case, Pizza Hut was required to submit evidence
establishing that the impliedly false or misleading statements were material
to, that is, they had a tendency to influence the purchasing decisions of, the
consumers to which they were directed.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"

evidence proffered by Pizza Hut fails to make an adequate showing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In its appellate brief and during the course of
oral argument, Pizza Hut directs our attention to three items of evidence in
the record that it asserts establishes materiality to consumers. First, Pizza
Hut points to the results of a survey conducted by an �independent expert� (Dr.
Dupont) regarding the use of the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� as
written on Papa John's pizza box (the box survey). The results of the box
survey, however, were excluded by the district court.<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[18]</span></span></span></a> Consequently, these survey
results provide no basis for the jury's finding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, Pizza Hut points to two additional surveys
conducted by Dr. Dupont that attempted to measure consumer perception of Papa
John's �taste test� ads. This survey evidence, however, fails to address Pizza
Hut's claim of materiality with respect to the slogan. Moreover, the jury
rejected Pizza Hut's claims of deception with regard to Papa John's �taste
test� ads&#8212;the very ads at issue in these surveys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, Pizza Hut attempts to rely on Papa John's
own tracking studies and on the alleged subjective intent of Papa John's
executives �to create a perception that Papa John's in fact uses better
ingredients� to demonstrate materiality. Although Papa John's 1998 Awareness,
Usage &amp; Attitude Tracking Study showed that 48% of the respondents believe
that �Papa John's has better ingredients than other national pizza chains,� the
study failed to indicate whether the conclusions resulted from the advertisements
at issue, or from personal eating experiences, or from a combination of both.
Consequently, the results of this study are not reliable or probative to test
whether the slogan was material. Further, Pizza Hut provides no precedent, and
we are aware of none, that stands for the proposition that the subjective
intent of the defendant's corporate executives to convey a particular message
is evidence of the fact that consumers in fact relied on the message to make
their purchases. Thus, this evidence does not address the ultimate issue of
materiality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In short, Pizza Hut has failed to offer probative
evidence on whether the misleading facts conveyed by Papa John's through its
slogan were material to consumers: that is to say, there is no evidence
demonstrating that the slogan had the tendency to deceive consumers so as to
affect their purchasing decisions. <i>See American Council,</i> 185 F.3d at
614; <i>Blue Dane,</i> 178 F.3d at 1042&#8211;43; <i>Sandoz Pharm. Corp. v.
Richardson&#8211;Vicks, Inc.,</i> 902 F.2d 222, 228&#8211;29 (3d Cir.1990).
Thus, the district court erred in denying Papa John's motion for judgment as a
matter of law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Additionally, we note that the district court erred
in requiring Papa John's to modify the Carney ads and the taste test ads. The
Carney ads were removed from the jury's consideration by Pizza Hut, and the
jury expressly concluded that the taste test ads were not actionable under
section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. Thus, the district court, lacking the
necessary factual predicate, abused its discretion in ordering Papa John's to
modify these ads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>V</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, we hold that the slogan �Better
Ingredients. Better Pizza.� standing alone is not an objectifiable statement of
fact upon which consumers would be justified in relying. Thus, it does not
constitute a false or misleading statement of fact actionable under section
43(a) of the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Additionally, while the slogan, when appearing in
the context of some of the post-May 1997 comparative
advertising&#8212;specifically, the sauce and dough campaigns&#8212;was given
objectifiable meaning and thus became misleading and actionable, Pizza Hut has
failed to adduce sufficient evidence establishing that the misleading facts
conveyed by the slogan were material to the consumers to which it was directed.
Thus, Pizza Hut failed to produce evidence of a Lanham Act violation, and the
district court erred in denying Papa John's motion for judgment as a matter of
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, the judgment of the district court
denying Papa John's motion for judgment as a matter of law is REVERSED; the
final judgment of the district court is VACATED; and the case is REMANDED for
entry of judgment for Papa John's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>REVERSED, VACATED, and REMANDED with instructions.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>WALKER, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A Quaker State television commercial asserts that
�tests prove� its 10W&#8211;30 motor oil provides better protection against
engine wear at start-up. In a thoughtful opinion reported at 1992 WL 47981
(S.D.N.Y. March 2, 1992), the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (Charles S. Haight, <i>Judge</i> ) held that
plaintiff-appellee Castrol, Inc. (�Castrol�) had proven this advertised claim
literally false pursuant to � 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)
(1988). The district court issued a March 20, 1992 Order preliminarily
enjoining defendants-appellants Quaker State Corporation, Quaker State Oil
Refining Corporation, and Grey Advertising Inc., (�Quaker State�), from airing
the commercial. We agree that Castrol has shown a likelihood of success in
proving the commercial literally false. We accordingly affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judge Haight's March 2, 1992 opinion thoroughly
recites the facts of this case. We describe only those facts essential to the
disposition of this appeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The voiceover to Quaker State's 10W&#8211;30 motor oil
commercial states:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Warning: Up to half of all engine
wear can happen when you start your car.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>At this critical time, tests prove
Quaker State 10W&#8211;30 protects better than any other leading 10W&#8211;30
motor oil.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>In an overwhelming majority of
engine tests, Quaker State 10W&#8211;30 flowed faster to all vital parts. In
all size engines tested, Quaker State protected faster, so it protected better.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Get the best protection against
start up wear. Today's Quaker State! It's one tough motor oil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Visually, the commercial begins with a man entering
a car and then shows a bottle of Quaker State 10W&#8211;30 motor oil. Large,
block letters, superimposed over the bottle, �crawl� across the screen with the
words:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>AT START UP QUAKER STATE
10W&#8211;30 PROTECTS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER LEADING 10W&#8211;30 MOTOR OIL.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Originally, this �crawl� used the words �tests prove�
instead of �at start up,� but shortly after the filing of the current lawsuit
Quaker State revised the message. The commercial then shows an engine,
superimposed over which are bottles of Quaker State and four competing motor
oils (including Castrol GTX 10W&#8211;30) and a bar graph depicting the speed
with which each oil flowed to components of a Chrysler engine. The Quaker State
bar is higher than all four competitors indicating that it flowed faster. The
commercial closes with the words: �ONE TOUGH MOTOR OIL.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Polymethacrylate or �PMA,� an additive intended to
quicken oil flow to engine parts, is the source of Quaker State's superiority
claim. The competitors listed in its commercial use olefin copolymer or �OCP,�
another additive. Two laboratory tests, the first run in 1987 and the second in
1991, have compared Quaker State's PMA&#8211;based oil with competing
OCP&#8211;based oils. Rohm and Haas, the Pennsylvania corporation which
manufactures PMA, conducted both tests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Rohm and Haas' 1987 tests measured two performance
indicators: �oiling time,� or the time it takes for oil to reach distant parts
in a just-started engine, and engine wear, measured through the amount of metal
debris observed in the oil after the engine had run. Rohm and Haas technicians
filled engines, in all other respects similar, with either Quaker State's
PMA&#8211;based 10W&#8211;30 oil, or with a generic OCP&#8211;based oil known
as �Texstar.� During numerous engine starts, Quaker State's oil demonstrated a
substantially faster oiling time, reaching distant engine parts as much as 100 seconds
earlier than the Texstar competitor. Contrary to expectations, however, this
did not translate into reduced engine wear. A Rohm and Haas report stated that
�[a]fter 64 starts ... the Quaker State oil gave marginally better results, but
there was no significant difference in wear metals accumulation between the two
oils.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Rohm and Haas initially attributed the poor engine
wear results to the presence of �residual oil� remaining from the prior engine
starts. They theorized that this oil might be lubricating the engine in the
period between ignition and arrival of the new oil, and so might be preventing
the faster flowing Quaker State oil from demonstrating better protection that
is statistically significant. To address this, they conducted additional engine
starts with a warm-up between each run so as to burn off the residual oil. The
Rohm and Haas report, however, concluded that �[w]ear metals analysis for this
test cycle also failed to differentiate significantly between the two oils....�
Thus, while the 1987 Rohm and Haas tests demonstrated faster oil flow, they
could not prove better protection against engine wear that is statistically
significant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The 1991 Rohm and Haas tests compared Quaker
State's oiling time with that of four leading OCP&#8211;based competitors,
including Castrol GTX 10W&#8211;30. Again, Quaker State's PMA&#8211;based oil
flowed significantly faster to engine parts. Using a 1991 2.2 liter Chrysler
engine with a sump temperature of minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, for example, the
Quaker State oiling time was 345 seconds, as compared to the competing oils'
times of 430, 430, 505 and 510 seconds. In the 1991 tests, as opposed to the 1987
studies, Rohm and Haas made no attempt to measure whether this faster oiling
time resulted in reduced engine wear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State broadcast their commercial in
November, 1991. On December 19, 1991, Castrol initiated the present action.
Castrol asserted that no studies supported the commercial's claim that �tests
prove� Quaker State's oil provides better protection, and that this claim of
test-proven superiority constituted false advertising. It sought preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief and damages pursuant to � 43(a) of the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a), New York General Business Law �� 349, 350, and common
law unfair competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the hearing on the motion for a preliminary
injunction, Quaker State relied on the Rohm and Haas tests. It argued that the
Rohm and Haas oiling time findings support the advertised claim of better
protection because oil which flows faster to engine parts necessarily protects
them better. Dr. Elmer Klaus, Quaker State's sole expert witness, explained
this �faster means better� theory as follows: Prior to start-up �the metal
parts [of an engine] are not separated by a film of oil. The solid members are sitting
on each other,� a condition referred to as �boundary lubrication.� Upon
ignition, engine wear begins to occur. Soon, however, the movement of the parts
generates a film of lubrication from the �residual oil� remaining from a prior
running of the engine and engine wear ceases. But the heat of the running
engine thins the residual oil which can no longer keep the parts sufficiently
apart. The engine returns to a condition of boundary lubrication and wear again
occurs until the arrival of the new oil. Dr. Klaus concluded that the faster
the new oil flows to the engine parts, the better job it does of minimizing
this second period of boundary lubrication. Faster oil flow, therefore, means
better protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Castrol's three experts focused on the role of
residual oil. They testified that the small amount of residual oil left from a
prior running of an engine provides more than adequate lubrication at the next
start-up. Moreover, they asserted that this residual oil remains functional for
a significant period of time so that both PMA&#8211;based and OCP&#8211;based
10W&#8211;30 motor oils reach the engine parts <i>before</i> this residual oil
burns off. Thus, they maintained, there is no second boundary lubrication
period and Quaker State's faster oiling time is irrelevant to engine wear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Castrol's experts supported their residual oil
theory with a Rohm and Haas videotape, produced in the course of its tests,
which shows the residual oil present on the cam lobe interface of a Chrysler
2.2 liter engine. Dr. Hoult, who narrated the tape for the court, explained
that �as the film goes on the lubricant there will never go away[,] which means
it's lubricated throughout the starting process and that's the basic reason
that the time for the replenishment oil to reach these parts is not related to
wear[,] because the parts have already lubricated okay.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The experts also cited the near absence of
catastrophic engine failure since the imposition of mandatory �pumpability�
standards, known as �J300� standards, in the early 1980's. Pumpability refers
to the ease with which the pump can spread oil throughout the engine. As
pumpability increases, oiling times decrease. Prior to the J300 standards,
certain oils became unpumpable in cold weather. This, the experts testified,
caused engines to suffer catastrophic failure within a �fraction� of a second
after the residual oil had burned off. The J300 standards, however, required
increased pumpability and have virtually eradicated reported cases of engine
failure. The experts inferred that all 10W&#8211;30 oils, which are required to
meet the J300 standards, must therefore be reaching the engine before the
residual oil burns off. At best, there is only a �fraction� of a second between
residual oil burn-off and catastrophic failure during which a faster flowing
oil could conceivably reduce engine wear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court assessed the parties'
conflicting testimony in its March 2, 1991 opinion. Judge Haight found Dr.
Klaus' testimony lacking in credibility because</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[Dr. Klaus'] current research programs at Pennsylvania
State University are funded in significant part by Quaker State or an industry
association to which Quaker State belongs. Klaus arrived at his opinions not on
the basis of independent research but by digesting technical papers furnished
to him by Quaker State and Rohm and Haas in preparation for his testimony; and
he acknowledged that he reached his conclusion concerning Quaker State's better
protection before even being made aware of the contrary 1987 Rohm and Haas
tests.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Judge Haight credited the testimony of Castrol's three
experts. In addition, he found their testimony corroborated by three key facts:
(1) the failure of the 1987 Rohm and Haas tests to demonstrate reduced engine
wear; (2) the Rohm and Haas technician's 1987 hypothesis that the presence of
residual oil might be the reason for the failure to show better engine wear
protection that is statistically significant; and (3) the virtual disappearance
of catastrophic engine failure following the imposition of the J300 standards.
Judge Haight accordingly �accept[ed]� the residual oil theory put forth by
these experts. The court explained that an engine is like �a fort besieged by
an encircling and encroaching enemy.� The enemy is engine wear; the fort's
supplies are residual oil; and a relief column on its way to reinforce the fort
is the new oil. �If that relief column does not reach the bearing surfaces
before the residual oil is burned away, the engine will suffer not only wear
but catastrophic failure.... [T]he Quaker State commercial is false because the
evidence shows that during the time differentials demonstrated by the [Rohm and
Haas] oiling tests, residual oil holds the fort.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judge Haight concluded that because residual oil
�holds the fort,� Rohm and Haas' faster oiling time findings did not
necessarily prove better protection. He consequently held that �Castrol has
established the likelihood of proving at trial the falsity of Quaker State's
claim that tests prove its oil protects better against start-up engine wear.�
On March 20, 1992, 1992 WL 73569 the district court entered an Order granting
preliminary injunctive relief. Quaker State appeals.</p>

<p class=Centered>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must
show (a) that it will suffer irreparable harm if relief is denied, and (b)
either (1) a likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious
questions going to the merits to make them fair ground for litigation and a balance
of hardships tipping decidedly in plaintiff's favor. <i>See Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. v. Chesebrough&#8211;Pond's, Inc.,</i> 747 F.2d 114, 118 (2d
Cir.1984); <i>Coca&#8211;Cola Co. v. Tropicana Prods., Inc.,</i> 690 F.2d 312,
314&#8211;15 (2d Cir.1982); <i>United States v. Siemens Corp.,</i> 621 F.2d
499, 505 (2d Cir.1980). We will presume irreparable harm where plaintiff
demonstrates a likelihood of success in showing literally false defendant's
comparative advertisement which mentions plaintiff's product by name. <i>See
McNeilab, Inc. v. American Home Products Corp.,</i> 848 F.2d 34, 38 (2d
Cir.1988); <i>Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.,</i> 760

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1125(a) (1988), pursuant to which Castrol brings this false advertising claim,
provides that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or
services ... uses in commerce any ... false or misleading description of fact,
or false or misleading representation of fact, which&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;* * * * * *</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(2) in commercial advertising or

origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial
activities,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>shall be liable in a civil action by any person who
believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To succeed under � 43(a), a plaintiff must demonstrate that
�an advertisement is either literally false or that the advertisement, though
literally true, is likely to mislead and confuse consumers.... Where the
advertising claim is shown to be literally false, the court may enjoin the use
of the claim �without reference to the advertisement's impact on the buying
public.�� <i>McNeil&#8211;P.C.C., Inc. v. Bristol&#8211;Myers Squibb Co.,</i>
938 F.2d 1544, 1549 (2d Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Coca&#8211;Cola,</i> 690 F.2d at
317) (citations omitted). Here, Castrol contends that the challenged
advertisement is literally false. It bears the burden of proving this to a
�likelihood of success� standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we have on two occasions explained, plaintiff
bears a different burden in proving literally false the advertised claim that
tests prove defendant's product superior, than it does in proving the falsity
of a superiority claim which makes no mention of tests. In <i>Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. v. Chesebrough&#8211;Pond's, Inc.,</i> 747 F.2d 114 (2d Cir.1984),
for example, Chesebrough alleged the literal falsity of Procter's advertised
claim that �clinical tests� proved its product superior. <i>Id.</i> at 116.
Procter, in return, challenged as literally false a Chesebrough commercial
which, making no mention of tests, asserted that its lotion was equal in
effectiveness to any leading brand. <i>Id.</i> We explained that in order to
prove literally false Procter's claim of �test-proven superiority,� Chesebrough
bore the burden of �showing that the tests referred to by P &amp; G were not
sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty that
they established the proposition for which they were cited.� <i>Id.</i> at 119.
We held that Procter could prove false Chesebrough's advertisement, however,
�only upon adducing evidence� that affirmatively showed Chesebrough's claim of
parity to be false. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We drew this same distinction in <i>McNeil&#8211;P.C.C.,
Inc. v. Bristol&#8211;Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 938 F.2d 1544 (2d Cir.1991).
Bristol&#8211;Myers initially advertised to trade professionals that �clinical
studies� had shown its analgesic provided better relief than McNeil's. <i>Id.</i>
at 1546. Bristol&#8211;Myers' later televised commercial made the product
superiority claim but �did not refer to clinical studies.� <i>Id.</i> We held
that, with respect to the initial trade advertising, �McNeil could ... meet its
burden of proof by demonstrating that these studies did not establish that AF
Excedrin provided superior pain relief.� <i>Id.</i> at 1549. With respect to
the televised commercial, however, McNeil bore the burden of generating
�scientific proof that the challenged advertisement was false.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A plaintiff's burden in proving literal falsity
thus varies depending on the nature of the challenged advertisement. Where the
defendant's advertisement claims that its product is superior, plaintiff must
affirmatively prove defendant's product equal or inferior. Where, as in the
current case, defendant's ad explicitly or implicitly represents that tests or
studies prove its product superior, plaintiff satisfies its burden by showing
that the tests did not establish the proposition for which they were cited. <i>McNeil,</i>
938 F.2d at 1549. We have held that a plaintiff can meet this burden by
demonstrating that the tests were not sufficiently reliable to permit a
conclusion that the product is superior. <i>Procter,</i> 747 F.2d at 119; <i>see
also Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co.,</i> 720 F.Supp. 194, 213
(D.D.C.1989), <i>aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds,</i> 913 F.2d
958 (D.C.Cir.1990); <i>American Home Prods. Corp. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,</i>
654 F.Supp. 568, 590 (S.D.N.Y.1987); <i>Thompson Medical Co. v.
Ciba&#8211;Geigy Corp.,</i> 643 F.Supp. 1190, 1196&#8211;99 (S.D.N.Y.1986). The
<i>Procter</i> �sufficiently reliable� standard of course assumes that the
tests in question, if reliable, would prove the proposition for which they are
cited. If the plaintiff can show that the tests, even if reliable, do not
establish the proposition asserted by the defendant, the plaintiff has
obviously met its burden. In such a case, tests which may or may not be
�sufficiently reliable,� are simply irrelevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court held that Castrol had met this
latter burden, stating that �Castrol has established the likelihood of proving
at trial the falsity of Quaker State's claim that tests prove its oil protects
better....� In this Lanham Act case, we will reverse the district court's order
of preliminary injunctive relief �only upon a showing that it abused its
discretion, which may occur when a court bases its decision on clearly
erroneous findings of fact or on errors as to applicable law.� <i>Procter,</i>
747 F.2d at 118.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I. <span style='font-style:normal'>The district court
committed no errors of law</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State contends that the district court
improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant when it stated that
�the claim that tests demonstrate ... superiority is false because no test does
so and [Dr.] Klaus' analysis fails to fill the gap.� It argues that plaintiff
bears the burden in a false advertising action and there should be no �gap� for
defendant to fill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Where a plaintiff challenges a test-proven superiority
advertisement, the defendant must identify the cited tests. Plaintiff must then
prove that these tests did not establish the proposition for which they were
cited. <i>McNeil,</i> 938 F.2d at 1549. At the hearing, Quaker State cited the
1987 and 1991 Rohm and Haas oiling time tests in conjunction with Dr. Klaus'
theory of engine wear at the second boundary lubrication period. Castrol's
burden was to prove that neither the Rohm and Haas tests alone, nor the tests
in conjunction with Dr. Klaus' theory, permitted the conclusion to a reasonable
certainty that Quaker State's oil protected better at start-up. The district
court's statement that �no test [demonstrates superiority] and Klaus' analysis
fails to fill the gap� is a finding that Castrol, through its residual oil
theory, met its burden. It is, in substance, a finding that the Quaker State
tests, which proved faster oiling time, are irrelevant to their claim that
Quaker State's oil protects better at start-up. Therefore, we need not consider
the tests' reliability. The district court's statement does not shift the
burden to defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State also contends that the district court
should have subjected the 1987 Rohm and Haas engine wear results to <i>Procter'</i>s
�sufficiently reliable� test before relying on them. It argues, in other words,
that the <i>Procter</i> standard applies not only to the studies offered to
support defendant's claim of test-proven superiority, but also to plaintiff's
evidence offered to rebut this claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State misreads <i>Procter.</i> In that case,
we established that a plaintiff proves false a test-proven superiority claim
when it shows that �the tests referred to by [defendant were] not sufficiently
reliable....� <i>Id.</i> at 119. This phrase merely establishes plaintiff's
burden of proof with respect to defendant's tests. It in no way limits the
evidence which plaintiff may use in meeting this burden. Such evidence is governed
by the usual standards of admissibility. It was not error for the district
court to consider the 1987 tests in this regard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. <i>The district court's findings as to the role of
residual oil were not clearly erroneous.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State asserts that the district court's
factual findings as to the role of residual oil are clearly erroneous. <i>See</i>
Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We disagree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Supreme Court has explained that �[i]f the
district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record
viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though
convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed
the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the
evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.� <i>Anderson
v. City of Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573&#8211;74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511,
84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <i>see also ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd.,</i>
944 F.2d 971, 978 (2d Cir.1991). We owe particularly strong deference where the
district court premises its findings on credibility determinations. �[W]hen a
trial judge's finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one
of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially
plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding,
if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error.� <i>Anderson,</i>
470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. at 1512; <i>see also ABKCO,</i> 944 F.2d at 978
(trial court's credibility determinations entitled to �considerable
deference�). A district court finding is clearly erroneous only where �
�although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire
evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
committed.� � <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 573, 105 S.Ct. at 1511 (quoting <i>United
States v. United States Gypsum Co.,</i> 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542,
92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, the district court heard five days of
expert testimony. Its credibility determinations in favor of Castrol's experts
and against Quaker State's support its finding that �residual oil holds the
fort.� This finding also receives support from the videotape of residual oil in
an engine, the absence of catastrophic engine failure following the imposition
of the J300 standards, and Rohm and Haas' 1987 failure to demonstrate reduced
engine wear. Nothing in the record convincingly contradicts the district
court's conclusion. Under the applicable legal standards, we are hard pressed
to hold Judge Haight's residual oil finding clearly erroneous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State argues that the residual oil theory
flies in the face of decades of technical literature documenting the existence
of start-up wear. It reasons that if residual oil truly lasted until the new
oil arrived, start-up wear would not be possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Hoult, a Castrol expert, answered this point.
He testified that the term �start-up,� as used in the cited technical papers,
refers not to the period between ignition and full oil flow but to the time
between ignition and the achievement of equilibrium temperature in the engine.
The relatively cool engine temperature during the start-up period, thus
defined, results in increased wear due to certain chemical properties best
described by Dr. Hoult himself:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>When the engine is driven for a short period of time under
cold conditions, it never gets fully warm. And in the combustion process of
reciprocating engines, there are acids which are formed, typically nitrate
acid; if the fuels have sulfur, sulfuric acid. In a cold engine, there is more
acids that mix with the lubricants than there is in a hot engine, because in a
hot engine, the parts are hot enough that the acid doesn't condense on them. So
that when an engine is colder[,] when it's started up from cold conditions, the
engine chemistry is different. And the general understanding [in the field] is
that that changes engine wear rate.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>This credited testimony effectively rebuts Quaker
State's objection. Viewing the record as a whole, we are not left with a �
�definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.� � <i>Anderson,</i>
470 U.S. at 573, 105 S.Ct. at 1511 (citation omitted). We accordingly reject
Quaker State's contention that Judge Haight's findings on the role of residual
oil are clearly erroneous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III. <span style='font-style:normal'>Is the district court's
injunction overly broad?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In a March 20, 1992 memorandum opinion accompanying
its simultaneously-issued Order of Preliminary Injunction, the district court
explained its intent �to enjoin preliminarily Quaker State from claiming �that
tests prove its oil protects better against start-up engine wear.� � The
injunction, however, goes beyond this limited intent. Paragraph 2 of the
injunction states that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Defendants ... are preliminarily enjoined from
broadcasting, publishing or disseminating, in any manner or in any medium, any
advertisement, commercial, or promotional matter ... that claims, directly or
by clear implication, that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(a) Quaker State 10W&#8211;30
motor oil provides superior protection against engine wear at start-up;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(b) Quaker State 10W&#8211;30
motor oil provides better protection against engine wear at start-up than other
leading 10W&#8211;30 motor oils, including Castrol GTX 10W&#8211;30; or</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(c) Castrol GTX 10W&#8211;30 motor
oil provides inferior protection against engine wear at start-up.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>This paragraph enjoins Quaker State from distributing <i>any</i>
advertisement claiming that its oil provides superior protection against engine
wear at start-up, whether or not the ad claims test-proven superiority. As
explained above, Castrol bears a different burden of proof with respect to this
broader injunction than it does in seeking to enjoin only commercials which
make the test-proven superiority claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court expressly found that Castrol had
met its burden with respect to any test-proven superiority advertisement. It
stated that �Castrol has established the likelihood of proving at trial the
falsity of Quaker State's claim that tests prove its oil protects better....�
Its injunction would be too broad, however, absent the additional finding that
Castrol had met its burden with respect to superiority advertisements that omit
the �tests prove� language. As we have noted above, Castrol meets this burden
by adducing proof that Quaker State's oil is not, in fact, superior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judge Haight made this additional finding. Castrol
submitted the report from the 1987 Rohm and Haas tests as proof that Quaker
State's oil did not protect better. This submission was proper under our
holding that �[plaintiff can] rel [y] on and analy[se] data generated by
[defendant] as scientific proof that the challenged advertisement was false.� <i>McNeil&#8211;P.C.C.,</i>
938 F.2d at 1549. The district court, referring to this document, stated that
�the record makes it crystal clear that to the extent tests were performed to
demonstrate better wear protection (as opposed to faster flowing), <i>the tests
contradict, rather than support</i> the claim. I refer to the 1987 Rohm and
Haas tests....� (emphasis added). The court went on to find that �Quaker State
presents no convincing argument to counter the unequivocal conclusion of Roland
[author of the 1987 report], a Rohm and Haas scientist, that the 1987 tests
failed to demonstrate a superiority in protection against engine wear....�
These statements amount to a finding that Castrol has met the additional
burden. The injunction is not overly broad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Quaker State also asks us to limit the injunction
to advertisements based on the 1987 and 1991 Rohm and Haas tests. It contends
that it should not be barred from advertising a superiority claim if later
tests should support it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Any time a court issues a preliminary injunction
there is some chance that, after the issuance of the order but prior to a full
adjudication on the merits, changes in the operative facts will undercut the
court's rationale. We will not, however, require the district court to draft a
technical and narrow injunction to address the possibility of additional tests
which are, at this time, purely hypothetical. If tests supporting its claim do
come to light, Quaker State may move to modify or dissolve the injunction. <i>See
Flavor Corp. of Am. v. Kemin Indus., Inc.,</i> 503 F.2d 729, 732 (8th
Cir.1974); 11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure,</i>
� 2961 at 604 (1973). We will likely have jurisdiction to review the district
court's disposition of such a motion, and can consider the issue at that point
if necessary. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. � 1292(a)(1) (1988); <i>United States v.
City of Chicago,</i> 534 F.2d 708, 711 (7th Cir.1976) (denial of motion to
dissolve preliminary injunction is appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. �
1292(a)(1)); <i>Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Western Penn. Motor Carriers

<p class=NormalNoIndent>ROSENN, Circuit Judge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The primary issue raised by this appeal is whether
one of this nation's major oil companies engaged in deceptive advertising in
violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) (1988). The parties to this
appeal further call upon this court to interpret the degree to which commercial
speech is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Commercial advertising plays a dynamic role in the
complex financial and industrial activities of our society, leading author
Norman Douglas to go so far as to observe that �[y]ou can tell the ideals of a
nation by its advertisements.�<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[19]</span></span></span></a>
Because honesty and fair play are prominent arrows in America's quiver of
commercial and personal ideals, Congress enacted section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act �to stop the kind of unfair competition that consists of lying about goods
or services.� <i>U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v. Jartran, Inc.,</i> 681 F.2d 1159, 1162
(9th Cir.1982). Although �[c]omparative advertising, when truthful and
nondeceptive, is a source of important information to consumers and assists
them in making rational purchase decision,� <i>Triangle Publications v.
Knight-Ridder Newspapers,</i> 626 F.2d 1171, 1176 (5th Cir.1980), the consumer
called upon to discern the true from the false requires a fair statement of
what is true and false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The plaintiff-appellee in this case, Castrol Inc.
(Castrol), a major motor oil manufacturer and distributor of its products, sued
in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging
that Pennzoil Company and Pennzoil Products Company (Pennzoil) advertised its
motor oil in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act when it claimed that
its product �outperforms any leading motor oil against viscosity breakdown.�
Additionally, Castrol challenged Pennzoil's related secondary claim that Pennzoil's
motor oil provides �longer engine life and better engine protection.� After a
bench trial on the merits, the district court held that Pennzoil's
advertisements contained claims of superiority which were �literally false.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Consequently, the court permanently enjoined
Pennzoil from �broadcasting, publishing, or disseminating, in any form or in
any medium,� the challenged advertisements or any �revised or reformulated
versions� thereof. This injunction was superseded by a more narrowly tailored
Amended Order and Final Judgment, prohibiting only �revised or reformulated <i>false
or deceptive</i> versions of the commercials.� The district court denied
Castrol's request for money damages and attorney's fees and retained
jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing or modifying its judgment. Pennzoil
immediately appealed on the grounds that its advertisements did not contain
false claims and that the permanent injunction issued by the district court
infringed on its right to free speech as protected by the First Amendment.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I. FACTS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court opinion thoroughly recites the
material facts of this case, which are not in dispute. <i>Castrol Inc. v.
Pennzoil Co. &amp; Pennzoil Prods. Co.,</i> 799 F.Supp. 424 (D.N.J.1992). We
set forth only a distillation thereof essential to an understanding of our
disposition of this appeal. Castrol's suit stems from a Pennzoil advertising
campaign of its motor oil consisting of print and television commercials. These
commercials feature either various members of national race car glitterati, or
Arnold Palmer, a professional golf luminary of national repute, asserting that
Pennzoil motor oil outperforms any leading motor oil against viscosity
breakdown. The court found that the advertisements also implied that Pennzoil's
products offered better protection against engine failure than any other
leading motor oil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Motor oils minimize metal-to-metal contact in an
engine by providing an optimum protective film between moving parts. The oils
are designed to provide sufficient resistance to flow to maintain the oil's
thickness and protective film across the wide range of temperatures and stress
generated by high speed motor engines. The measure of a motor oil's resistance
to flow is called �viscosity.� Ideally, viscosity should remain at an adequate
level under all types of stress when the oil flows between engine parts in
operation, but stress may cause a �shearing� effect which breaks down the
viscosity of the oil during engine use. Viscosity breakdown has both a
mechanical and chemical effect, the first causing a physical thinning of the
lubricant and the latter the formation of sludge, varnish, and deposits on the
engine. Because it is critical to motor oil performance, viscosity is the basis
on which motor oils are classified and marketed by a grading system known as
�SAE J300.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> According to SAE J300, the viscosity of unused
motor oils is measured by an industry-recognized laboratory test developed by
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The tests and
specifications measure the breakdown in motor oil viscosity caused by the
stress of shearing and high temperatures during engine use. The court found
that the Committee of Common Market Automobile Constructors (CCMC) has
established �the most demanding viscosity breakdown standards.� <i>Castrol,</i>
799 F.Supp. at 430. CCMC is an association of major European automobile
manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar. CCMC motor oil
specifications contain two viscosity breakdown requirements: (1) the Shear
Stability or Stay-in-Grade test, and (2) the High Temperature/High Shear (HTHS)
test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Stay-in-Grade Test requires that the subject
motor oil, after being sheared, maintain a minimum kinematic viscosity level in
order to remain within its SAE J300 grade. The Stay-in-Grade standard is a
�pass/fail� standard, and it does not rank motor oils within each grade. The
district court found that all Castrol and Pennzoil passenger car motor oils
pass the SAE J300 standards for their specified grades. <i>Castrol,</i> 799
F.Supp. at 429. Both parties to the litigation have stipulated that Pennzoil
does not outperform Castrol against the Stay-in-Grade viscosity breakdown
standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The HTHS test is a more rigorous test, which
measures an oil's reduced viscosity during exposure to high temperatures and
large shear forces generated by rapidly moving parts similar to the conditions
in an operating engine. HTHS standards have been adopted by the Society of
Automotive Engineers (SAE), the CCMC, General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford. By
this standard's measure, Pennzoil did not outperform Castrol in any way;
rather, it was Castrol motor oils which proved superior.<a href="#_ftn21"
name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[21]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Pennzoil, however, does not rely on the
aforementioned tests to lend credence to its claims of superiority with respect
to viscosity breakdown and protection from engine wear. Rather, Pennzoil
claimed superiority on the basis of research it conducted utilizing the ASTM
D-3945 Test, promulgated by the American Society of Testing and Materials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Pursuant to this test, motor oil is passed through
a diesel injector nozzle at a shear rate that causes a reduction in the
kinematic viscosity of the fluid under test. The reduction in kinematic
viscosity is reported as a <i>percent loss</i> of the initial kinematic
viscosity. These tests showed that Pennzoil motor oil suffered less viscosity
loss percentage than Castrol motor oil. Pennzoil contends that <i>percent
viscosity loss</i> is one method of measuring viscosity breakdown and therefore
asserts that this test substantiates its advertised superiority claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court, however, found that the
ASTM-3945 Test was not a true measure of viscosity breakdown; it therefore
relied upon the Stay-in-Grade and the HTHS tests. These tests, along with
others conducted by Castrol, led the trial court to find that Pennzoil's claims
of superiority for viscosity breakdown and engine protection were literally
false. Pennzoil challenges these findings and argues also that the district
court's injunction infringes upon Pennzoil's right to freedom of speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �We review the district court's conclusions of law
in plenary fashion, its factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard,
and its decision to [grant or] deny an injunction on an abuse of discretion
standard.� <i>Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. v. Richardson-Vicks, Inc.,</i> 902
F.2d 222, 226 (3d Cir.1990) (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II. THE VISCOSITY BREAKDOWN CLAIM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, Pennzoil asserts that, absent any evidence
of consumer confusion in this case, Castrol failed to meet its burden of
proving literal falsity by the standard set forth in <i>Sandoz, supra.</i>
Likewise, a substantial portion of the dissent is spent urging that <i>Sandoz</i>
requires that we consider consumer evidence even in a case where there has been
a finding of literal falsity. However, this argument ignores crucial
differences between the case <i>sub judice</i> and <i>Sandoz.</i> In <i>Sandoz,</i>
we sustained the trial court's findings that the advertisements in question
were <i>not literally false</i> and held, where the advertisements are <i>not
literally false,</i> a plaintiff bears the burden of proving actual consumer
deception. <i>Sandoz,</i> 902 F.2d at 228-29. The <i>Sandoz</i> trial court
resorted to proof of consumer confusion only after finding that the challenged
claims were <i>not literally false.</i> As that court stated:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Where the advertisements are <i>not literally false,</i>
plaintiff bears the burden of proving actual deception by a preponderance of
the evidence. Hence, it cannot obtain relief by arguing how consumers could
react; it must show how consumers actually do react.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied) (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the instant case, however, the trial court found
that Pennzoil's advertisements were literally false. <i>Sandoz</i> definitively
<i>holds</i> that a plaintiff must prove <i>either</i> literal falsity <i>or</i>
consumer confusion, but not both. <i>Sandoz,</i> 902 F.2d at 227; <i>see also
McNeil-P.C.C., Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 938 F.2d 1544, 1549 (2d
Cir.1991) (Where the advertisement is shown to be literally false, the court
may enjoin it without reference to its impact on the consumer.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, there are two different theories of recovery
for false advertising under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act: �(1) an
advertisement may be false on its face; or (2) the advertisement may be
literally true, but given the merchandising context, it nevertheless is likely
to mislead and confuse consumers.� <i>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. GAC Int'l, Inc.,</i>
862 F.2d 975, 977 (2d Cir.1988) (Garth, J., sitting by designation).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>When a merchandising statement or representation is
literally or explicitly false, the court may grant relief without reference to
the advertisement's impact on the buying public. When the challenged
advertisement is implicitly rather than explicitly false, its tendency to
violate the Lanham Act by misleading, confusing or deceiving should be tested
by public reaction.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Coca-Cola Co. v. Tropicana Prod., Inc.,</i> 690 F.2d
312, 317 (2d Cir.1982) (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, because the district court properly
found that claims in this case were literally false, it did not err in ignoring
Pennzoil's superfluous evidence relating to the absence of consumer confusion.
In addition, because the advertisement in <i>Sandoz</i> was not literally
false, that case's references to consumer confusion, read in context, are
completely consistent with the majority's disposition of this matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, Pennzoil argues that Castrol failed to
sustain its burden of proving literal falsity because Castrol never offered
affirmative proof to refute Pennzoil's claims, but merely cast doubt upon
Pennzoil's research. <i>See, e.g., Castrol, Inc. v. Quaker State Corp.,</i> 977
F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir.1992) ( �Where the defendant's advertisement claims that
its product is superior plaintiff must affirmatively prove defendant's product
equal or inferior.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Yet Pennzoil's contention is meritless, as the
trial record is replete with Castrol's affirmative evidence proving the literal
falsity of Pennzoil's claims. For example, between October 25, 1991, and
February 26, 1992, the Castrol Technical Center conducted the CCMC,
International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee, and Chrysler
Stay-in-Grade Tests. Both Pennzoil and Castrol met the Stay-in-Grade
requirements, thus refuting Pennzoil's contention that it outperforms Castrol
with respect to viscosity breakdown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Between January 1, 1992, and March 25, 1992, the
Castrol Technical Center conducted HTHS Tests, and all Castrol motor oils met
the HTHS standard established by the CCMC, as well as all the other HTHS
specifications. Pennzoil's 5W-30 and 10W-30 motor oils, however, failed to meet
this standard, although other Pennzoil motor oils passed this test. Therefore,
this test also did not substantiate Pennzoil's claims of <i>superiority;</i> on
the contrary, it demonstrated Pennzoil motor oil's <i>inferiority</i> in some
respects to Castrol motor oil. Thus, according to the only two industry
accepted tests for measuring viscosity breakdown, Pennzoil's claims of
superiority were literally false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Castrol also presented expert testimony and field
tests which affirmatively demonstrated that Pennzoil motor oil does not
outperform Castrol motor oil with respect to viscosity breakdown. For example,
the Southwest Research Institute conducted an automobile fleet test at
Castrol's request. Researchers placed Pennzoil motor oil inside a group of
three automobiles, each of a different model, and then placed Castrol motor oil
inside three cars identical to the first set. The researchers then drove these
automobiles through various tests and compared the viscosity breakdown of the
two motor oils. According to this test, Castrol motor oil outperformed
Pennzoil's product with respect to viscosity breakdown, therefore discrediting
Pennzoil's claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, the court found that Pennzoil failed to
adequately refute Castrol's affirmative evidence. For example, the fundament of
Pennzoil's claim of superior protection against viscosity breakdown was the
results of its ASTM D-3945 Test. Castrol's expert, Marvin F. Smith, Jr.
(Smith), who was a member of the task force which developed the ASTM D-3945
Test method, testified that the ASTM D-3945 test renders inaccurate results
with regard to viscosity breakdown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith explained that the ASTM-3945 Test was developed
for manufacturers to measure the quality of one batch of oil against the next
batch of the same type of oil. This test was never intended to compare the
viscosity breakdown of oils of different polymer classes, and the test cannot
perform this function accurately. Pennzoil and Castrol are motor oils of
different polymer classes, and thus this test's comparison of the two oils
proves nothing relevant. Actually, the test does not measure viscosity
breakdown at all; rather, it measures percentage of viscosity loss. As Trial
Judge Wolin perceptively observed:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Pennzoil ignores the caveat embodied in the [ASTM D-3945]
test as to the significance and use of ASTM D-3945. In � 4.2 it states �[T]hese
test methods are not intended to predict viscosity loss in field service for
different polymer classes or for different field equipment.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Castrol Inc. v. Pennzoil Co. &amp; Pennzoil Prods.
Co.,</i> 799 F.Supp. 424, 438 (D.N.J.1992). Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that
Castrol presented affirmative evidence to prove the literal falsity of
Pennzoil's claims and that Judge Wolin did not find Pennzoil's evidence to
rebut Castrol's proof persuasive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The dissent asserts, however, that a defendant need
only establish a reasonable basis to support its claims to render the
advertisement literally true. We disagree. Rather, the test for literal falsity
is simpler; if a defendant's claim is untrue, it must be deemed literally
false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, Pennzoil made a claim of superiority,
and when tested, it proved false. Hence, under this standard, the district
court correctly found literal falsity. Therefore, Castrol sustained its burden
of proof, especially given this court's narrow scope of review:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>If the district court's account of the evidence is
plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals
may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier
of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two
permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot
be clearly erroneous.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;* * * * * *</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>[Moreover,] when a trial judge's
finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more
witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that
is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally
inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Anderson v. Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573-75,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Pennzoil and the dissent assert that the district
court declined to allow Pennzoil to rely on the ASTM-3945 Test to substantiate
its claims solely because the test is not an industry standard. They argue,
therefore, that the court erred because an advertised product's failure to meet
industry standards does not render the advertisement literally false. <i>See
ConAgra, Inc. v. Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co.,</i> 784 F.Supp. 700 (D.Neb.1992).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We do not disagree that a test which is not an
industry standard can yield accurate results. However, the district court did
not enjoin Pennzoil's advertisements merely because the ASTM-3945 was not an
industry standard test. It did so because it found that the ASTM-3945 Test did
not measure viscosity breakdown at all. On the contrary, that test measured <i>percent
viscosity loss.</i><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span

<p class=Centered>III. THE ENGINE WEAR CLAIM</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court rejected Pennzoil�s argument that its claims
regarding superior engine protection were mere �puffery.� The court also
affirmed the district court�s determination that these superiority claims were
false by necessary implication</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>IV. THE FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In essence, the district court has enjoined
Pennzoil only from broadcasting, publishing, or disseminating the very
statements which the court found to be literally false. Pennzoil argues that
this is a prior restraint, in contravention of the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution. At this moment, however, these claims are false,
and it is well settled that false commercial speech is not protected by the First
Amendment and may be banned entirely. <i>Bates v. State Bar of Ariz.,</i> 433
U.S. 350, 383, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2709, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977). Moreover, the prior
restraint doctrine does not apply in this case because there has been �an
adequate determination that [the expression] is unprotected by the First
Amendment.� <i>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations,</i>
413 U.S. 376, 390, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2561, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973). The injunction
is also not overbroad because it only reaches the specific claims that the
district court found to be literally false. If, in the future, Pennzoil should
improve its motor oil to surpass Castrol for viscosity breakdown, Pennzoil can
at that time apply for a modification of the present injunction. <i>See F.T.C.
v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 778 F.2d 35, 44 (D.C.Cir.1985).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>HALL, District Judge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The plaintiff, Schick Manufacturing Company
(�Schick�), seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendant, The
Gillette Company (�Gillette�), from making certain claims about its M3 Power
razor system (�M3 Power�). Schick contends that Gillette has made various false
claims in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) and
the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (�CUTPA�), Conn. Gen.Stat. �
42&#8211;110a, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In order to succeed on its false advertising claim,
Schick must prove five elements of this claim. <i>Omega Engineering, Inc. v.
Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> 30 F.Supp.2d 226, 255 (D.Conn.1998) (citing various
treatises and cases). These are the following:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) The defendant has made a false or misleading statement
of fact. The statement must be (a) literally false as a factual matter or (b)
likely to deceive or confuse. <i>S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Clorox
Company,</i> 241 F.3d 232, 238 (2d Cir.2001).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) The statement must result in actual deception or
capacity for deception �Where the advertising claim is shown to be literally
false, the court may enjoin the use of the claim without reference to the
advertisement's impact on the buying public.� <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations
omitted).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) The deception must be material. �[I]n addition to
proving falsity, the plaintiff must also show that the defendants
misrepresented an inherent quality or characteristic of the product.� <i>Id.</i>
(internal quotations omitted).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(4) Schick must demonstrate that it has been injured
because of potential decline in sales. Where parties are head-to-head
competitors, the fact that the defendant's advertising is misleading
presumptively injures the plaintiff. <i>Coca&#8211;Cola Co. v. Tropicana
Products, Inc.,</i> 690 F.2d 312, 317 (2d Cir.1982) (abrogated on other grounds
by statute as noted in <i>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. GAC Int'l, Inc.,</i> 862
F.2d 975, 979 (2d Cir.1988)).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(5) The advertised goods must travel in interstate
commerce.</p>

<p class=Centered><b>FACTS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court held a scheduling conference on the
preliminary injunction motion on March 2, 2005. The court allowed the parties
to conduct limited discovery prior to conducting a hearing on Schick's motion
for a preliminary injunction. The hearing on the motion was conducted over four
days: April 12, 13, 22, and May 2, 2005. During the hearing, Schick called five
witnesses: Adel Mekhail, Schick's Director of Marketing; Peter M. Clay,
Gillette's Vice&#8211;President for Premium Systems; Dr. David J. Leffell,
Professor of Dermatology; Christopher Kohler, Schick Research Technician; and
John Thornton, statistical consultant. Gillette also called five witnesses
during the hearing: Dr. Kevin L. Powell, Gillette's Director of the Advanced
Technology Centre; Dr. Michael A. Salinger, Professor of Economics; Peter M.
Clay, Gillette's Vice&#8211;President for Premium Systems; Dr. lan Saker,
Gillette Group Leader at the Advanced Technology Centre and Dr. Michael P.
Philpott, Professor of Cutaneous Biology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The men's systems razor and blade market is worth
about $1.1 billion per year in the United States. Gillette holds about 90% of
the dollar share of that market, while Schick holds about 10%. The parties are
engaged in head-to-head competition and the court credits testimony that growth
in the razor systems market results not from volume increases but �with the
introduction of high price, new premium items.� Hr'g Tr. 39:20&#8211;21.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Schick launched its Quattro razor system in
September of 2003 and expended many millions of dollars in marketing the
product. Although Schick had projected $100 million in annual sales for the Quattro,
its actual sales fell short by approximately $20 million. From May 2004 to
December 2004, Quattro's market share fell from 21% of dollar sales to 13.9% of
dollar sales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette launched the M3 Power in the United States
on May 24, 2004. In preparation for that launch, it began advertising that
product on May 17, 2004. The M3 Power is sold throughout the United States. The
M3 Power includes a number of components including a handle, a cartridge, guard
bar, a lubricating strip, three blades, and a battery-powered feature which
causes the razor to oscillate. The market share of the M3 Power, launched in
May 2004, was 42% of total dollar sales in December 2004.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette's original advertising for the M3 Power
centered on the claim that �micropulses raise hair up and away from skin,� thus
allowing a consumer to achieve a closer shave. This �hair-raising� or hair
extension claim was advertised in various media, including the internet,
television, print media, point of sale materials, and product packaging. For
example, Gillette's website asserted that, in order to combat the problem of
�[f]acial hair grow[ing] in different directions,� the M3 Power's
�[m]icro-pulses raise hair up and away from skin ...� PX 2, Hr'g Tr.
33:25&#8211;34:22. Of Gillette's expenditures on advertising, 85% is spent on
television advertising. At the time of the launch, the television advertising
stated, �turn on the first micro-power shaving system from Gillette and turn on
the amazing new power-glide blades. Micro-pulses raise the hair, so you shave
closer in one power stroke.� PX 14.2(C). The advertisement also included a 1.8
second-long animated dramatization of hairs growing. In the animated cartoon,
the oscillation produced by the M3 Power is shown as green waves moving over
hairs. In response, the hairs shown extended in length in the direction of
growth and changed angle towards a more vertical position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court notes that eight months passed between
the launch of the M3 Power and the date Schick initiated the instant suit.
Schick maintains that there are two factors that excuse this delay. First,
Schick invested time in developing a stroke machine and test protocol that
would allow it to test the M3 Power with some degree of confidence and
effectiveness.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[24]</span></span></span></a>
Specifically, the development of a machine that would deliver a stroke of
consistent pressure to a test subject's face took time. Second, after
completing its first tests of Gillette's claims that the M3 Power raises hair
in October, Schick chose to pursue its claims in Germany. In November of 2004,
Schick sued Gillette in Germany to enjoin it from making claims that the M3
Power raised hairs. In late December of 2004, the Hamburg Regional Court
affirmed the lower court's order enjoining Gillette from making such claims in
Germany.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While the court finds that it may have been
possible to develop testing protocols in a quicker fashion, the court finds the
M3 Power was a new product with a feature (the use of battery power) that had
never before been present in wet shavers. The court finds the time Schick took
to develop testing of and to test the M3 Power is excusable. The court has been
presented with no evidence of bad faith or strategic maneuvering behind the
timing of the instant lawsuit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In late January of 2005, Gillette revised its
television commercials for the M3 Power in the United States. It chose to do so
based on both the German litigation as well as conversations between the
parties about Schick's discomfort with certain claims made in the advertising.
The animated product demonstration in the television commercials was revised so
that the hairs in the demonstration no longer changed angle, and some of the
hairs are shown to remain static. The voice-over was changed to say, �Turn it on
and micropulses raise the hair so the blades can shave closer.� PX 14.10C. The
product demonstration in the revised advertisements depicts the oscillations to
lengthen many hairs significantly. The depiction in the revised advertisements
of how much the hair lengthens&#8212;the magnitude of the extension&#8212;is
not consistent with Gillette's own studies regarding the effect of micropulses
on hair. The animated product demonstration depicts many hairs extending, in
many instances, multiple times the original length. Gillette began broadcasting
the revised television commercials on or about January 31, 2005. Schick
provided credible evidence, however, that the prior version of the
advertisement is still featured on the Internet and on product packaging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Television advertisements aim to provide consumers
a �reason to believe,� that is, the reason consumers should buy the advertised
product. Because of the expense of television advertising, companies have a very
short period of time in which to create a �reason to believe� and are generally
forced to pitch only the key qualities and characteristics of the product
advertised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette conceded during the hearing that the M3
Power's oscillations do not cause hair to change angle on the face. Its
original advertisements depicting such an angle change are both unsubstantiated
and inaccurate. Gillette also concedes that the animated portion of its television
advertisement is not physiologically exact insofar as the hairs and skin do not
appear as they would at such a level of magnification and the hair extension
effect is �somewhat exaggerated.� Gillette Co.'s Prop. Findings of Fact [Dkt.
No. 114] � 33. The court finds that the hair �extension� in the commercial is
greatly exaggerated. Gillette does contend, however, that the M3 Power's
oscillations cause beard hairs to be raised out of the skin. Gillette contends
that the animated product demonstration showing hair extension in its revised
commercials is predicated on its testing showing that oscillations cause
�trapped� facial hairs to lengthen from the follicle so that more of these
hairs' length is exposed. Gillette propounds two alternative physiological bases
for its �hair extension� theory. First, Gillette hypothesizes that a facial
hair becomes �bound� within the follicle due to an accumulation of sebum and
corneocytes (dead skin cells). Gillette contends that the oscillations could
free such a �bound� hair. Second, Gillette hypothesizes that hairs may deviate
from their normal paths in the follicle and become �trapped� outside the path
until vibrations from the M3 Power restore them to their proper path.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Schick's expert witness, Dr. David Leffell,
Professor of Dermatology and Chief of Dermatologic Surgery at the Yale School
of Medicine, testified that, based on his clinical and dermatological
expertise, he is aware of no scientific basis for the claim that the
oscillations of the M3 Power would result in hair extension, as Gillette
contends. Dr. Leffell stated that Gillette's �hair extension� theory is
inconsistent with his 20 years of experience in dermatology. He testified that
he has never seen a hair trapped in a sub-clinical manner, as hypothesized by
Gillette. Dr. Leffell testified that, in certain circumstances, trapped hairs
will result in clinical symptoms, such as infection or inflammation. With
respect to Gillette's hypothesis that the interaction between sebum and
corneocytes trap hairs, however, Dr. Leffell stated, and the court credits,
that in non-clinical circumstances, sebum and comeocytes do not accumulate
sufficiently to inhibit hair growth. Moreover, everyday activities such as
washing or shaving remove accumulations of sebum and corneocytes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette's expert hair biologist, Dr. Michael
Philpott, has studied hair biology for almost twenty years. He testified that,
prior to his retention as an expert by Gillette, he had never seen a hair
trapped in the manner posited by Gillette. Only after being retained by
Gillette did Dr. Philpott first claim to have encountered this hair extension
theory. Dr. Philpott acknowledged that neither of Gillette's two hypothesis of
hair extension have any support in medical or scientific literature. With
regard to Gillette's theory that hair could become bound in the follicle by
sebum and corneocytes, Dr. Philpott admitted that no evidence supports that
theory. Dr. Leffell testified that erector pili muscles, which cause hairs to
stand up in response to various stimuli, as is commonly seen in the case of
goosebumps, may also provide a biologicial mechanism for hair extension.
Neither Dr. Leffell nor Dr. Philpott, however, testified on the relationship
between the application of mechanical energy and the erector pili muscles, and
neither party has contended that these muscles play a role in Gillette's hair
extension theory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to positing biological mechanisms that
might support the claim that the M3 Power's oscillations raise hairs, Gillette
introduced evidence of experiments and testing to support those claims.
Gillette provided summaries of said testing which were not prepared
contemporaneously with the testing, conducted in the early 1990's, they purport
to memorialize. Instead, they were prepared in anticipation of litigation in
late 2004.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette performed experiments using oscillating
razors in 1990, 1991 and 2003. In 1990 and 1991, Gillette performed studies
using prototype oscillating razor handles fitted with razor systems other than
the M3 Power, the Atra Plus and Sensor razor cartridge, two other Gillette
products. In each of these initial experiments, a circle was drawn on a test
subject's face. Twenty beard hairs within the circled region were measured with
an imaging stereomicroscope manufactured by the Leica Company. That instrument
measures hairs three-dimensionally to a resolution of three to four microns.
The test subject then stroked the area using an oscillating razor with blunted
blades. Then, twenty beard hairs within the circled region were again measured
with a stereomicroscope. The same protocol was followed using a non-oscillating
razor with blunted blades, and the changes in hair measurement were compared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Atra Plus study was performed in 1990 and
included 10 test subjects. The study results show that the panelists' average
hair length increased by 83.3 microns after five strokes with the oscillating
razor versus 6.3 microns with the non-oscillating razor. The Sensor study was performed
from 1990 to 1991 and also involved 10 test subjects. The subjects' mean hair
length increased by 27.9 microns versus 12.9 microns with the non-oscillating
razor. While both tests provided some evidence of a hair extension effect and
the magnitude of that effect, neither test indicated what percentage of hairs
were lengthened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Notably, while Gillette found that use of both the
oscillating Atra Plus and Sensor razors resulted in an increase in beard hair
length, there was significant difference between the average increase caused by
the Atra Plus and that caused by the Sensor. Furthermore, no evidence was
presented to the court regarding similarities or differences between the M3
Power razor and the Atra Plus or Sensor. The sample size, ten test subjects per
study, was small. The twenty beard hairs measured prior to stroking were not
necessarily the same hairs measured after stroking. The test included no
efforts to keep constant the variables of pressure on the razor or speed of the
shaving stroke. In addition, Gillette's chief scientist, Kevin Powell,
testified that the pressure or load applied by consumers co-varies to a
statistically significant degree with whether a razor oscillates. All these
deficiencies cause this court not to credit the studies' finding that oscillations
cause hair lengthening.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[25]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 2003, Gillette performed a study using a
prototype of the M3 Power. In the fall of 2003, Gillette tested a Mach 3
cartridge fitted with an oscillating handle. That prototype was called the
�Swan.� The Swan prototype's motor, handle, and cartridge differ from those
features of the actually-marketed M3 Power. Four test subjects were used.<a
href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[26]</span></span></span></a> The test protocol was
identical to that used in 1990 and 1991 except that, instead of using blunted
blades, Gillette removed the blades from the razor. The study results suggest
that the oscillating-Swan-prototype produced an average increase in hair length
of between 32 and 40 microns while the non-oscillating prototype yielded no
average increase. That 32 to 40 micron increase represented an average of eight
to ten percent increase in hair length. The test does not indicate what
percentage of hairs experience any lengthening as a result of oscillations. The
court does not credit Dr. Powell's opinion that the differences between the
model used in the test and the marketed product has no impact on the testing.
Failure to use the marketed product is critical. The court cites the varied
results Gillette reports between the Atra Plus, Sensor, and �Swan� tests as
only one reason to conclude that failure to use the market product undercuts
the 2003 testing. Further, the test protocol and sample size cause the court to
question the validity of these study findings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to testing oscillating battery-powered
razors, Gillette conducted what has been called the Microwatcher study. The
Microwatcher is a commercially available product consisting of a miniature
camera with an illumination system that channels light into an orifice at the
tip of a transparent hemispherical dome. The device allows the user to impart
mechanical energy into the top and underlying layers of the skin, which,
according to Gillette, replicates the mechanical energy imparted by the
oscillating razor.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[27]</span></span></span></a>
The recorded video images introduced into evidence show individual hairs
releasing from just below the skin surface. Gillette did not introduce evidence
to describe what the various elements of the photo were. When asked by the
court to identify the various elements appearing in the video were, Dr.
Philpott could not identify or explain important skin features. For example,
the court pointed to an area surrounding the individual hair, of darker hue
than the rest of the skin, on the video, but Dr. Philpott could not explain
what that area was or what might explain its coloration. The court further
finds that Gillette provides no evidence to suggest the relationship between
the amount of mechanical energy imparted by the Microwatcher and that imparted
by the M3 Power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Schick performed its own study which it contends
proves the falsity of Gillette's advertising with respect to claims regarding
hair extension.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[28]</span></span></span></a>
Schick's study took place over three days and included 37 test subjects. With
respect to each test subject, twenty hairs were measured before and after
strokes with an M3 Power razor with blunted blades in both the power-on and
power-off modes. The strokes were taken using an automated shaving device
developed specially by Schick for the purposes of testing the M3 Power razor
and Gillette's claims with respect to it. Images of the hairs were taken before
and after the razor strokes using a camera with a plate that flattened hair
onto the face. The images were then downloaded to a computer and hair lengths
were assessed using ImagePro software. An independent statistician evaluated
the data for all three days. Schick argues that its data indicates that there
was no statistically significant difference between the change in hair length
with power off and the change in hair length with power on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Again, however, the court finds the test protocol
lacking and results questionable. Schick's testing shows that some hairs shrunk
even in the absence of the use of water, which Gillette's testing has found to
result in hair shrinkage. Schick's expert testified that this may have been the
result of measurement error, and the court agrees.<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[29]</span></span></span></a> Furthermore, Gillette
provided expert testimony that the glass plate used to flatten hairs so that
they could be measured would likely result in distortion, making it difficult
to accurately measure hair lengths. Such flaws in Schick's testing cause the
court to be skeptical of Schick's test results and the suggestion that these
results demonstrate that the M3 Power does not cause hairs to extend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The flaws in testing conducted by both parties
prevent the court from concluding whether, as a matter of fact, the M3 Power
raises beard hairs.</p>

<p class=Centered><b>II. ANALYSIS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>�</span></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><b>B. False Advertising</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <b>1. Literal Falsity.</b> �Falsity may be
established by proving that (1) the advertising is literally false as a factual
matter, or (2) although the advertising is literally true, it is likely to
deceive or confuse customers.� <i>Nat'l Basketball Ass'n v. Motorola, Inc.,</i>
105 F.3d 841, 855 (2d Cir.1997). �A plaintiff's burden in proving literal
falsity thus varies depending on the nature of the challenged advertisement.� <i>Castrol,
Inc.,</i> 977 F.2d at 63. The Second Circuit has found that where an
advertisement alleges that tests have established a product's superiority, a
plaintiff must demonstrate that the tests or studies did not prove such
superiority. �[A] plaintiff can meet this burden by demonstrating that the tests
were not sufficiently reliable to permit a conclusion that the product is
superior.� <i>Id.</i> In addition, �[i]f the plaintiff can show that the tests,
even if reliable, do not establish the proposition asserted by the defendant,
the plaintiff has obviously met its burden.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Where, however, as here, the accused advertising
does not allege that tests or clinical studies have proven a particular fact,
the plaintiff's burden to come forward with affirmative evidence of falsity is
qualitatively different. �To prove that an advertising claim is literally
false, a plaintiff must do more than show that the tests supporting the
challenged claim are unpersuasive.� <i>Mc&#8211;Neil&#8211;P.C.C., Inc. v.
Bristol&#8211;Myers Squibb Co.,</i> 938 F.2d 1544, 1549 (2d Cir.1991). The
plaintiff must prove falsity by a preponderance of the evidence, either using
its own scientific testing or that of the defendant. If a plaintiff is to
prevail by relying on the defendant's own studies, it cannot do so simply by
criticizing the defendant's studies. It must prove either that �such tests �are
not sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty
that they established� the claim made� or that the defendant's studies establish
that the defendant's claims are false. <i>Id.</i> at 1549&#8211;50.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The challenged advertising consists of two basic
components: an animated representation of the effect of the M3 Power razor on
hair and skin and a voice-over that describes that effect. The animation, which
lasts approximately 1.8 seconds, shows many hairs growing at a significant
rate, many by as much as four times the original length. During the animation,
the voice-over states the following: �Turn it on and micropulses raise the hair
so the blades can shave closer.� Schick asserts that this M3 Power advertising
is false in three ways: first, it asserts the razor changes the angle of beard
hairs; second, it portrays a false amount of extension; and third, it asserts
that the razor raises or extends the beard hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to the first claim of falsity, if the
voiceover means that the razor changes the angle of hairs on the face, the
claim is false. Although Gillette removed the �angle changing� claim from its
television advertisements, it is unclear whether it has completely removed all
material asserting this angle-change claim. The court concludes that the
current advertising claim of �raising� hair does not unambiguously mean to
changes angles.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[30]</span></span></span></a>
<i>See Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8211;Merck
Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.,</i> 290 F.3d 578, 587 (3d Cir.2002) (�only an
unambiguous message can be literally false�). Thus, the revised advertising is
not literally false on this basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to the second asserted basis of
falsity, the animation, Gillette concedes that the animation exaggerates the
effect that the razor's vibration has on hair. Its own tests show hairs
extending approximately 10% on average, when the animation shows a
significantly greater extension. The animation is not even a �reasonable
approximation,� which Gillette claims is the legal standard for non-falsity. <i>See</i>
Gillette's Prop. Conclusions of Law at � 32, 37&#8211;38 [Dkt. No. 114]. Here,
Schick can point to Gillette's own studies to prove that the animation is
false. <i>See Mc&#8211;Neil&#8211;P.C.C., Inc.,</i> 938 F.2d at 1549.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette argues that such exaggeration does not
constitute falsity. However, case law in this circuit indicates that a
defendant cannot argue that a television advertisement is �approximately�
correct or, alternatively, simply a representation in order to excuse a
television ad or segment thereof that is literally false. <i>S.C. Johnson &amp;
Son, Inc.,</i> 241 F.3d at 239&#8211;40 (finding that depiction of leaking
plastic bag was false where rate at which bag leaked in advertisement was faster
than rate tests indicated); <i>Coca&#8211;Cola Co.,</i> 690 F.2d at 318
(finding that advertisement that displaced fresh-squeezed orange juice being
poured into a Tropicana carton was false). Indeed, �[the Court of Appeals has]
explicitly looked to the visual images in a commercial to assess whether it is
literally false.� <i>S.C. Johnson,</i> 241 F.3d at 238.<a href="#_ftn31"
name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[31]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette's argument that the animated portion of
its advertisement need not be exact is wrong as a matter of law. Clearly, a
cartoon will not exactly depict a real-life situation, here, <i>e.g.,</i> the
actual uneven surface of a hair or the details of a hair plug. However, a party
may not distort an inherent quality of its product in either graphics or
animation. Gillette acknowledges that the magnitude of beard hair extension in
the animation is false. The court finds, therefore, that any claims with
respect to changes in angle and the animated portion of Gillette's current
advertisement are literally false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court does not make such a finding with respect
to Schick's third falsity ground, Gillette's hair extension theory generally.
Gillette claims that the razor's vibrations raise some hairs trapped under the
skin to come out of the skin. While its own studies are insufficient to
establish the truth of this claim, the burden is on Schick to prove falsity.
Neither Schick's nor Gillette's testing can support a finding of falsity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While there can be no finding of literal falsity
with respect to Gillette's hair extension claim at this stage in the instant
litigation, the court expresses doubt about that claim. As described earlier,
Gillette's own testing is suspect. Furthermore, Schick introduced expert
testimony and elicited evidence from Gillette's expert regarding the lack of
scientific foundation for any biological mechanism that would explain the
effect described by Gillette in its advertising. Gillette's own expert, Dr.
Philpott, testified that no scientific foundation exists to support Gillette's
hypothesis that beard hairs might be trapped under the skin by sebum and
comeocytes and that the application of mechanical energy might release such
hairs. While Dr. Philpott put forward another hypothesis&#8212;that a hair's
curliness might cause it to be trapped-he also conceded that, prior to his
engagement as an expert on Gillette's behalf, in twenty years of studying hair,
he had never come across such a phenomenon. The court credits the testimony of
Schick's expert, Dr. Leffell, that while certain clinical conditions are
characterized by hairs trapped under the surface of the skin, there is no such
non-clinical phenomenon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nevertheless, putting forth credible evidence that
there is no known biological mechanism to support Gillette's contention that
the M3Power raises hairs is insufficient to meet Schick's burden. Such evidence
is not affirmative evidence of falsity. Further, while Schick successfully
attacked Gillette's testing, that attack did not result in evidence of falsity.
Unlike in <i>McNeil,</i> here Gillette's own tests do not prove hair extension
does not occur. Schick merely proved that Gillette's testing is inadequate to
prove it does occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <b>2. Actual Deception.</b> Schick need not prove
actual deception if Gilette's advertising is determined to be literally false. <i>Mc&#8211;Neil&#8211;P.C.C.,
Inc.,</i> 938 F.2d at 1549 (�Where the advertising claim is shown to be
literally false, the court may enjoin the use of the claim without reference to
the advertisement's impact on the buying public.� (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted)). Because the court finds that claims regarding angle change
and the magnitude and frequency of hair extension portrayed in the animated
portion of Gillette's television advertisement are both literally false, it
presumes that these claims result in actual deception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <b>3. Materiality.</b> �It is also well-settled
that, in addition to proving falsity, the plaintiff must also show that the
defendants misrepresented an inherent quality or characteristic of the product.
This requirement is essentially one of materiality, a term explicitly used in
other circuits.� <i>S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.,</i> 241 F.3d at 238 (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted). In determining that certain allegedly
false statements were not material, the Second Circuit considered the relevance
of the statements and the fact that �[t]he inaccuracy in the statements would
not influence customers.� <i>Nat'l Basketball Ass'n v. Motorola, Inc.,</i> 105
F.3d 841, 855 (2d Cir.1997).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is clear that whether the M3 Power raises hairs
is material. Gillette's employees testified that television advertising time is
too valuable to include things that are �unimportant�. Furthermore, in this
case, hair extension is the �reason to believe� that the M3 Power is a
worthwhile product. The magnitude and frequency of that effect are also,
therefore, material. Whether a material element of a product's performance
happens very often and how often that element happens are, in themselves,
material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <b>4. Injury.</b> The court finds that, in light of
the advertisement's literal falsity, the fact that the parties are head-to-head
competitors, and recent declines in the sale of Schick's premiere wet shave
system injury will be presumed. <i>Coca&#8211;Cola Co.,</i> 690 F.2d at
316&#8211;317. While Schick has not submitted consumer surveys or market
research, the fact that the parties are head-to-head competitors supports an
inference of causation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <b>5. Interstate Commerce.</b> The parties do not
dispute that this element of the claim has been established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, the court finds that Schick has
established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims insofar as
Gillette's claims regarding changes in hair angle and its animation depicting
an exaggerated amount of hair extension are literally false. The court finds that
Schick has failed to establish a likelihood of success, or even serious
questions going to the merits, on the claim of hair �extension.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><b>BOND</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette has requested a bond of $49,579,248. It
contends that this amount represents estimated lost profits on future M3 Power
sales, over a twelve-month period, if later found to have been wrongfully
enjoined. Schick submits that a bond of $50,000 to $100,000 is appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gillette's calculations assume a precipitous drop
in sales as a result of a mandate to correct two admitted falsities in its
advertisement.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[32]</span></span></span></a>
The court is skeptical that this calculation represents an appropriate bond amount.<a
href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[33]</span></span></span></a> Instead, the court imposes a
bond of $200,000 on Schick. Absent a record created by Gillette, the court
concludes this amount, generally in the range for false advertising cases, is
sufficient to protect Gillette. Gillette may move to increase the bond amount
upon a showing of likely injury.</p>

to whom the slogan was directed? Although the jury was specifically asked
whether the advertisements were likely to deceive consumers, the
interrogatories failed to ask whether the deception created by these
advertisements was material to the consumers to which the ads were
directed&#8212;that is, whether consumers actually relied on the misrepresentations
in making purchasing decisions.</p>

Specifically, the jury answered �No� to the following interrogatories: (1) Did
you find that Papa John's �taste test� commercials are a false or misleading
description or representation of fact which deceived or was likely to deceive a
substantial number of the consumers to whom the slogan was directed; and (2)
Did you find that Papa John's �ingredients� claims are false or misleading? The
�ingredients� ads found not to be false or misleading did not include any of
the �sauce� or �dough� ads.</p>

When construing the allegedly false or misleading statement to determine if it
is actionable under section 43(a), the statement must be viewed in the light of
the overall context in which it appears. <i>See Avis,</i> 782 F.2d at 385; <i>Southland,</i>
108 F.3d at 1139. �Fundamental to any task of interpretation is the principle
that text must yield to context.� <i>Avis,</i> 782 F.2d at 385. Context will
often help to determine whether the statement at issue is so overblown and
exaggerated that no reasonable consumer would likely rely upon it. As the court
in <i>Federal Express Corporation v. United States Postal Service,</i> 40
F.Supp.2d 943 (W.D.Tenn.1999), noted:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>On its face, [the statement at issue] does not seem to be
the type of vague, general exaggeration which no reasonable person would rely
upon in making a purchasing decision. Nevertheless, the determination of
whether an advertising statement should be deemed puffery is driven by the
context in which the statement is made. Where the context of an advertising
statement may lend greater specificity to an otherwise vague representation,
the court should not succumb to the temptation to hastily rule a phrase to be
unactionable under the Lanham Act.</p>

In the same vein, the Second Circuit has observed that �statements of opinion
are generally not the basis for Lanham Act liability.� <i>Groden v. Random
House,</i> 61 F.3d 1045, 1051 (2d Cir.1995). When a statement is �obviously a
statement of opinion,� it cannot �reasonably be seen as stating or implying
provable facts.� <i>Id.</i> �The Lanham Act does not prohibit false statements
generally. It prohibits only false or misleading description or false or
misleading representations of fact made about one's own or another's goods or
services.� <i>Id.</i> at 1052.</p>

In its memorandum opinion addressing Papa John's post-verdict Rule 50 motion,
the court stated:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Although Papa John's started in May 1995 with a slogan
which was essentially ambiguous and self-laudatory, consistent with the legal
definition of non-actionable puffery, Papa John's deliberately and
intentionally exploited its slogan as a centerpiece of its subsequent
advertising campaign after May 1997 which falsely portrayed Papa Johns's tomato
sauce and pizza dough as being superior to the sauce and dough components used
in Pizza Hut's pizza products. When the �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.�
slogan is considered in light of the entirety of Papa John's post-May 1997
advertising which violated the provisions of the Lanham Act and in the context
in which it was juxtaposed with the false and misleading statements contained
in Papa John's print and broadcast media advertising, the slogan itself became
tainted to the extent that its continued use should be enjoined.</p>

The testimony of Pizza Hut's expert, Dr. Faubion, established that although
consumers stated a preference for fresh dough rather than frozen dough, when
taste tests were conducted, respondents were unable to distinguish between
pizza made on fresh as opposed to frozen dough.</p>

The judgment of the district court enjoining the future use by Papa John's of
the slogan �Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.� did not simply bar Papa John's
use of the slogan in future ads comparing its sauce and dough with that of its
competitors. Rather, the injunction permanently enjoined any future use of the
slogan �in association with the sale, promotion and/or identification of pizza
products sold under the Papa John's name.� Further, the injunction precluded
Papa John's from using the �adjective �better� to modify the terms
�ingredients' and/or �pizza.� � While it is clear that the jury did not make
any finding to support such a broad injunction, and Pizza Hut offered no survey
evidence indicating how potential consumers viewed the slogan, the district
court concluded that the evidence established that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Papa John's deliberately and intentionally exploited its
slogan as a centerpiece of its subsequent advertising campaign after May 1997
which falsely portrayed Papa John's tomato sauce and pizza dough as being
superior to the sauce and dough components used in Pizza Hut's products....
[Thus,] the slogan itself became tainted to the extent that its continued use
should be enjoined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our review of the record convinces us that there is simply
no evidence to support the district court's conclusion that the slogan was
irreparably tainted as a result of its use in the misleading comparison sauce
and dough ads. At issue in this case were some 249 print ads and 29 television
commercials. After a thorough review of the record, we liberally construe eight
print ads to be sauce ads, six print ads to be dough ads, and six print ads to
be both sauce and dough ads. Further, we liberally construe nine television
commercials to be sauce ads and two television commercials to be dough ads.
Consequently, out of a total of 278 print and television ads, the slogan
appeared in only 31 ads that could be liberally construed to be misleading
sauce or dough ads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We find simply no evidence, survey or otherwise, to support
the district court's conclusion that the advertisements that the jury found
misleading&#8212;ads that constituted only a small fraction of Papa John's use
of the slogan&#8212;somehow had become encoded in the minds of consumers such
that the mention of the slogan reflectively brought to mind the misleading
statements conveyed by the sauce and dough ads. Thus, based on the record
before us, Pizza Hut has failed to offer sufficient evidence to support the
district court's conclusion that the slogan had become forever �tainted� by its
use as the tag line in the handful of misleading comparison ads.</p>

Since Pizza Hut sought only equitable relief and no monetary damages, it was

In <i>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Smithkline Beecham Corp.,</i> 960 F.2d 294 (2d
Cir.1992), the Second Circuit discussed this requirement in some detail:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Where, as here, a plaintiff's
theory of recovery is premised upon a claim of implied falsehood, a plaintiff
must demonstrate, by extrinsic evidence, that the challenged commercials tend
to mislead or confuse consumers. It is not for the judge to determine, based
solely upon his or her own intuitive reaction whether the advertisement is
deceptive. Rather, as we have reiterated in the past, �the question in such
cases is&#8212;what does the person to whom the advertisement is addressed find
to be the message?� That is, what does the public perceive the message to be.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>The answer to this question is
pivotal because, where the advertisement is literally true, it is often the
only measure by which a court can determine whether a commercial's net
communicative effect is misleading. Thus, the success of a plaintiff's implied
falsity claim usually turns on the persuasiveness of a consumer survey.</p>

Moreover, Pennzoil failed to meet even the dissent's liberal burden of proving
literal truth in this case. The dissent suggests that a defendant need only
establish a reasonable basis to support its claims to render the advertisement

Pennzoil could reasonably rely for its advertisements; it simply does not
measure viscosity breakdown.</p>
