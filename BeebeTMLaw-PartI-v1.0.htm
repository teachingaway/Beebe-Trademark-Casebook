<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to qualify for trademark protection under U.S. federal
law, a trademark must meet three basic requirements: (1) the trademark must be �distinctive�
of the source of the goods or services to which it is affixed, (2) the
trademark must not be disqualified from protection by various statutory bars to
protection, the most significant of which is that the trademark not be �functional,�
and (3) the trademark must be used in commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note what is missing from this list of basic requirements
for trademark protection.&nbsp; First, in order to qualify for protection under
the Lanham Act, a trademark does not need to be registered at the PTO (though,
as we will discuss in Part I.D, there are significant benefits to registration).&nbsp;
Lanham Act � 32, 15 U.S.C. � 1114, protects <i>registered</i> marks from
unauthorized uses that are likely to cause consumer confusion as to the true
source of the unauthorized user�s goods.&nbsp; Lanham Act � 43(a), 15 U.S.C. �
1125(a), does the same for <i>unregistered</i> marks.&nbsp; (And Section 43(c),
15 U.S.C. � 1125(c), protects both registered and unregistered marks from
trademark dilution).&nbsp; As a matter of tradition, trademark lawyers sometimes
refer to unregistered mark protection under � 43(a) as �common law� protection
of trademarks even though this protection is based on statutory federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, a protectable trademark need not manifest itself in
any particular form.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal>The reader may be quite surprised to see that trademark
rights can cover such a wide array of subject matter.&nbsp; This Part covers
how these various marks have managed to qualify for trademark protection and
why various other marks have failed to qualify.&nbsp; Section I.A devotes a
great deal of attention to what is by far the most important requirement for
trademark protection: that the trademark be �distinctive.�&nbsp; Section I.B
then turns to the various statutory bars to protection, including the
functionality bar, which disqualify marks from protection under the Lanham Act.&nbsp;
Section I.C seeks to make sense of the �use in commerce� requirement for
trademark protection.&nbsp; Section I.D reviews why it is worthwhile to
register a mark at the PTO and how the registration process works.&nbsp; Section
I.E addresses the geographic scope of the protection of registered and
unregistered marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The term �trademark� includes any word, name, symbol, or
device, or any combination thereof� used by a person� to identify and
distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those
manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if
that source is unknown.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The � 45 definition of the term �trademark� emphasizes that
a protectable trademark must be distinctive of source &#8212; it must �identify
and distinguish� goods� and� indicate the source of the goods.�&nbsp; Note that
in order to qualify for protection, a trademark need not indicate the precise manufacturing
source of the goods.&nbsp; For example, the trademark <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>tide</span> for laundry detergent need not indicate in exactly
which factory the particular bottle of laundry detergent was made or that
Proctor &amp; Gamble ultimately owns the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>tide</span>
brand.&nbsp; Instead, consumers need only know that all products bearing the same
trademark originate in or are sponsored by a single, albeit �unknown� or �anonymous,�
source.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[3]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
This is sometimes known as the �anonymous source� theory of trademark
protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A trademark will qualify as distinctive if either (1) it is
�inherently distinctive� of source or (2) it has developed �acquired
distinctiveness� of source.&nbsp; A mark is inherently distinctive if �its intrinsic
nature serves to identify a particular source.�&nbsp; <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
v. Samara Bros., Inc</i>., 529 U.S. 205 210 (2000) (alterations omitted).&nbsp;
The underlying assumption is that as a matter of consumer literacy, consumers
will almost instantly recognize, even when they encounter the mark for the
first time, that an inherently distinctive mark is a designation of
source.&nbsp; After all, how else would a modern consumer make sense of the
word �apple� as used in the sale of electronics that have nothing to do with
apples?&nbsp; Inherently distinctive marks �almost <i>automatically</i> tell a
customer that they refer to a brand,� <i>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.,
Inc</i>., 514 U.S. 159 162-63 (1995) (emphasis in original), and �immediately �
signal a brand or a product �source.��&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 163.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marks that lack inherent distinctiveness may nevertheless
qualify as distinctive if they have developed �acquired distinctiveness,�
otherwise known as �secondary meaning.�&nbsp; Over time, consumers may come to
identify what might have seemed merely a description of the good or service
(e.g., �American Airlines�) or merely a decoration on a product (e.g., three
stripes on the side of an athletic shoe) as a designation of the source of that
product.&nbsp; Indeed, consumers may come to identify the configuration of the
product itself as a signifier of its source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here in Section I.A, we will spend considerable time
reviewing how courts determine if a commercial sign qualifies as inherently
distinctive or as possessing acquired distinctiveness.&nbsp; Before proceeding,
two things should be kept in mind.&nbsp; First, some of the opinions below
address the registrability of the marks at issue at the PTO while other opinions
address the protectability under � 43(a) of marks that have never been
registered. Recall that registration is not a prerequisite for trademark
protection under the Lanham Act.&nbsp; Many significant trademark cases over
past decades have involved unregistered marks.&nbsp; The important point for
our purposes in this subsection is that the basic doctrine relating to the registrability
of a mark is essentially the same as the doctrine relating to whether it may be
protected regardless of its registration status.&nbsp; We may use opinions from
either context to understand the distinctiveness requirement in trademark law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, this subsection will first consider distinctiveness
doctrine as it relates to verbal marks, and will then proceed to the
considerably more difficult area of distinctiveness doctrine that covers
non-verbal marks, such as logos, colors, product packaging, and product configuration
(i.e., the shape of the product itself).</p>

<i>Abercrombie</i> Spectrum</a></a></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The excerpt below, from <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v.
Hunting World, Inc</i>., 537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir. 1976), analyzes some of the most
fundamental terms and concepts in trademark law.&nbsp; Though <i>Abercrombie</i>
is now a relatively old opinion, its influence on U.S. and even foreign
trademark law cannot be overstated.&nbsp; It is the origin of the �<i>Abercrombie</i>
spectrum� of trademark distinctiveness, a classification scheme that is used in
a wide variety of areas of trademark doctrine.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The essential facts underlying the opinion are as follows.&nbsp;
Plaintiff Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company (�A&amp;F�) operated various sporting
goods stores in New York City and elsewhere.&nbsp; It had multiple PTO
registrations for its trademark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>safari</span>.&nbsp;
Among these was a registration for <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>safari</span>
for cotton clothing, a registration for <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>safari</span>
for hats, and a registration for <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>safari</span>
for shoes.&nbsp; Defendant Hunting World, Incorporated (�HW�) began to sell at
its New York City store sporting apparel, including hats and shoes, bearing the
terms �Safari,� �Minisafari,� and �Safariland.�&nbsp; A&amp;F sued on the
ground that HW�s conduct would confuse consumers as to the true source of HW�s
goods.&nbsp; At the core of the case was the question of whether A&amp;F�s <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>safari</span> trademark lacked distinctiveness
of source on certain of A&amp;F�s goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you read the excerpt, consider the following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To the extent that a mark�s categorization somewhere along the <i>Abercrombie</i>
spectrum bears directly on whether the mark will qualify for trademark
protection, which borders between categories do you suspect are especially
disputed?</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

basic principles of trademark law, which, although they should be familiar,
tend to become lost in a welter of adjectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The cases, and in some instances the Lanham Act,
identify four different categories of terms with respect to trademark
protection. Arrayed in an ascending order which roughly reflects their
eligibility to trademark status and the degree of protection accorded, these
classes are (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or
fanciful. The lines of demarcation, however, are not always bright. Moreover,
the difficulties are compounded because a term that is in one category for a
particular product may be in quite a different one for another,<a href="#_ftn4"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span

be understood as referring, to the genus of which the particular product is a
species. At common law neither those terms which were generic nor those which
were merely descriptive could become valid trademarks, see Delaware &amp;
Hudson Canal Co. v. Clark, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 311, 323, 20 L.Ed. 581 (1872) (�Nor
can a generic name, or a name merely descriptive of an article or its qualities,
ingredients, or characteristics, be employed as a trademark and the exclusive
use of it be entitled to legal protection�). The same was true under the
Trademark Act of 1905, Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Mfg. Co., 220
U.S. 446, 31 S.Ct. 456, 55 L.Ed. 536 (1911), except for marks which had been

name=Document1zzF010101976123607></a> While, as we shall see, the Lanham Act
makes an important exception with respect to those merely descriptive terms which
have acquired secondary meaning, see � 2(f), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(f), it offers no
such exception for generic marks. The Act provides for the cancellation of a
registered mark if at any time it �becomes the common descriptive name of an
article or substance,� � 14(c). This means that even proof of secondary
meaning, by virtue of which some �merely descriptive� marks may be registered,
cannot transform a generic term into a subject for trademark. As explained in J.
Kohnstam, Ltd. v. Louis Marx and Company, 280 F.2d 437, 440, 47 CCPA 1080
(1960), no matter how much money and effort the user of a generic term has
poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has
achieved in securing public identification, it cannot deprive competing manufacturers
of the product of the right to call an article by its name. We have recently
had occasion to apply this doctrine of the impossibility of achieving trademark
protection for a generic term, CES Publishing Corp. v. St. Regis Publications,
Inc., 531 F.2d 11 (1975).&nbsp;&nbsp;The pervasiveness of the principle is
illustrated by a series of well known cases holding that when a suggestive or
fanciful term has become generic as a result of a manufacturer�s own
advertising efforts, trademark protection will be denied save for those markets
where the term still has not become generic and a secondary meaning has been
shown to continue.&nbsp;Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505 (2 Cir. 1921)
(L. Hand, D. J. ) [finding �aspirin� generic]; DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed
Products Co., 85 F.2d 75 (2 Cir.) (A. N. Hand, C. J. ), cert. denied, 299 U.S.
601 (1936) [finding �cellophane� generic]; King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin
Industries, Inc., 321 F.2d 577 (2 Cir.1963) [finding �thermos� generic].&nbsp;
A term may thus be generic in one market and descriptive or suggestive or
fanciful in another.</p>

<a name=Document1zzF011111976123607></a>stands on a better basis. Although �
2(e) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1052, forbids the registration of a mark
which, when applied to the goods of the applicant, is �merely descriptive,� �
2(f) removes a considerable part of the sting by providing that �except as
expressly excluded in paragraphs (a)-(d) of this section, nothing in this
chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which
has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce� and that the
Commissioner may accept, as prima facie evidence that the mark has become
distinctive, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark
applied to the applicant's goods for five years preceding the application. As
indicated in the cases cited in the discussion of the unregistrability of
generic terms, �common descriptive name,� as used in �� 14(c) and 15(4), refers
to generic terms applied to products and not to terms that are �merely
descriptive.� In the former case any claim to an exclusive right must be denied
since this in effect would confer a monopoly not only of the mark but of the
product by rendering a competitor unable effectively to name what it was
endeavoring to sell. In the latter case the law strikes the balance, with
respect to registration, between the hardships to a competitor in hampering the
use of an appropriate word and those to the owner who, having invested money
and energy to endow a word with the good will adhering to his enterprise, would
be deprived of the fruits of his efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The category of �suggestive� marks was spawned by
the felt need to accord protection to marks that were neither exactly
descriptive on the one hand nor truly fanciful on the other, a need that was
particularly acute because of the bar in the Trademark Act of 1905, 33 Stat.
724, 726, (with an exceedingly limited exception noted above) on the
registration of merely descriptive marks regardless of proof of secondary
meaning. See Orange Crush Co. v. California Crushed Fruit Co., 54 U.S.App.D.C.
313, 297 F. 892 (1924). Having created the category the courts have had great
difficulty in defining it. Judge Learned Hand made the not very helpful
statement:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>It is quite impossible to get any rule out of the cases
beyond this: That the validity of the mark ends where suggestion ends and
description begins.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Franklin Knitting Mills, Inc. v. Fashionit Sweater
Mills, Inc., 297 F. 247, 248 (S.D.N.Y.1923), aff'd per curiam, 4 F.2d 1018 (2
Cir. 1925), a statement amply confirmed by comparing the list of terms held
suggestive with those held merely descriptive in 3 Callmann, Unfair
Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies s 71.2 (3d ed.). Another court has observed,
somewhat more usefully, that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought
and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of goods. A term is
descriptive if it forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients,
qualities or characteristics of the goods.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp;
Manufacturers Inc., 295 F.Supp. 479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968). Also useful is the approach
taken by this court in Aluminum Fabricating Co. of Pittsburgh v. Season-All
Window Corp., 259 F.2d 314 (2 Cir. 1958), that the reason for restricting the
protection accorded descriptive terms, namely the undesirability of preventing
an entrant from using a descriptive term for his product, is much less forceful
when the trademark is a suggestive word since, as Judge Lumbard wrote, 259 F.2d
at 317:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The English language has a wealth of synonyms and related
words with which to describe the qualities which manufacturers may wish to
claim for their products and the ingenuity of the public relations profession
supplies new words and slogans as they are needed.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>If a term is suggestive, it is entitled to registration
without proof of secondary meaning. Moreover, as held in the Season-All case,
the decision of the Patent Office to register a mark without requiring proof of
secondary meaning affords a rebuttable presumption that the mark is suggestive
or arbitrary or fanciful rather than merely descriptive.</p>

<p class=CommentsandQuestions align=center style='text-align:center'>Comments
and Questions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Is �safari�
generic as to clothing, hats, and boots?</i>&nbsp; Judge Friendly found that
safari was a generic term when used in connection with certain items of clothing
and hats.&nbsp; Here is part of his reasoning:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>It is common ground that A&amp;F could not apply �Safari�
as a trademark for an expedition into the African wilderness. This would be a
clear example of the use of �Safari� as a generic term. What is perhaps less
obvious is that a word may have more than one generic use. The word �Safari�
has become part of a family of generic terms which, although deriving no doubt
from the original use of the word and reminiscent of its milieu, have come to
be understood not as having to do with hunting in Africa, but as terms within
the language referring to contemporary American fashion apparel. These terms
name the components of the safari outfit well-known to the clothing industry
and its customers: the �Safari hat�, a broad flat-brimmed hat with a single,
large band; the �Safari jacket�, a belted bush jacket with patch pockets and a
buttoned shoulder loop; when the jacket is accompanied by pants, the
combination is called the �Safari suit�.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Abercrombie</i>, 537 F.2d at 11-12.&nbsp; Judge
Friendly determined that the term �safari� was not generic, however, when used
in connection with boots; it was either suggestive or merely descriptive, and
because the registration of <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>safari</span>
for boots had become �incontestable� (a concept we will discuss below), the
mark was found in either case to be protected.&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 12.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, HW was deemed to be making a �fair use� (another concept we will
address below) of the term safari in connection with its boots and was thus
found not to be infringing. <i>Id</i>. at 12-13.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
will devote much more attention to the question of genericism in Part I.A.1.c
below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>What </i>Abercrombie<i>
borderlines are the most disputed?</i>&nbsp; Under the <i>Abercrombie</i>
spectrum, suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks qualify as inherently
distinctive and may be protected without a showing that the mark has developed
secondary meaning as a designation of source.&nbsp; Descriptive marks do not
qualify as inherently distinctive and require a showing of secondary meaning to
be protected.&nbsp; Generic marks may not be protected regardless of any
showing of secondary meaning.&nbsp; Thus, there are two significantly disputed
borders in the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum, the border between generic and
descriptive marks (addressed in Part I.A.1.c) and the border between
descriptive and suggestive marks (addressed in the next subsection).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In practice, it rarely makes much difference whether the
inherently distinctive mark is deemed suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful.&nbsp;
In the context of the likelihood of confusion analysis (discussed in Part II),
many courts recite the rule that fanciful marks should receive a greater scope
of protection than arbitrary marks, and arbitrary marks a greater scope of
protection than suggestive marks, but again, it is not clear that these
distinctions have had any effect on litigation outcomes.&nbsp; Indeed, courts
not uncommonly group arbitrary and fanciful marks into the same category, as <i>Abercrombie</i>
itself does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Coined terms that
are not fanciful, but rather suggestive</i>.&nbsp; Not all coined terms qualify
as fanciful.&nbsp; In <i>Surfvivor Media, Inc. v. Survivor Productions</i>, 406
F.3d 625 (9th Cir. 2005), the court analyzed the <i>Abercrombie</i>
classification of the trademark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>surfvivor</span>
for beach-themed products:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Because �Surfvivor� is a coined term, [plaintiff] Deptula
contends that it should be treated as a fanciful mark. However, the mere fact
that a mark consists of a coined term does not automatically render that mark
fanciful. See Interstellar Starship Servs. Ltd. v. Epix, Inc., 184 F.3d 1107,
1111 (9th Cir. 1999) (determining that the coined phrase &quot;EPIX&quot; for
electronic pictures should not automatically be considered an arbitrary [or
fanciful] mark). Fanciful marks have no commonly known connotation to the
product at hand. By contrast, the term &quot;Surfvivor&quot; is highly
evocative of the company's beach-related products.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 632.&nbsp; The court ultimately
determined that the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>surfvivor</span> mark
was suggestive.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>id</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Why choose a
non-inherently distinctive descriptive mark?</i>&nbsp; Lawyers may advise their
clients always to choose inherently distinctive marks (and ideally only
fanciful marks) because such marks do not require any showing of secondary
meaning to qualify for protection.&nbsp; Yet clients often prefer &#8212; and
the marketplace is full of &#8212; descriptive marks, particularly marks that
are descriptive in a laudatory sense (e.g., <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>best
buy</span>).&nbsp; Why should this be the case?&nbsp; In an opinion involving
the trademark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>fashionknit</span>, Judge
Learned Hand offered one persuasive explanation:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>I have always been at a loss to know why so many marks are
adopted which have an aura, or more, of description about them. With the whole
field of possible coinage before them, it is strange that merchants insist upon
adopting marks that are so nearly descriptive. Probably they wish to interject
into the name of their goods some intimation of excellence, and are willing to
incur the risk.</p>

<h5><a name="_Toc392009900"><a name="_Toc365129308">ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distinguishing
Suggestive from Descriptive Marks</a></a></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a number of reasons why a trademark owner would
want to show that a mark on the border between descriptiveness and
suggestiveness is in fact suggestive and thus inherently distinctive.&nbsp;
First, as we will see in Part I.A.1.b, it can be difficult and costly to show
that a mark deemed descriptive has developed secondary meaning as a designation
of source.&nbsp; Second, as we will see in Part I.D, only inherently
distinctive marks may be registered on an intent-to-use basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where a mark falls along the border between suggestiveness
and descriptiveness can be difficult to determine, and a court�s determination
of the issue difficult to predict.&nbsp; Courts� approaches vary, but all emphasize,
as did Judge Friendly in <i>Abercrombie</i>, the question of the degree of
�imagination� a consumer must use to connect the meaning of the mark to the
characteristics of the goods.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Platinum Home Mortgage
Corp. v. Platinum Financial Group, Inc</i>., 149 F.3d 722, 47 U.S.P.Q.2d 1587
(7th Cir. 1998) (stating the Seventh Circuit�s �degree of imagination� test as �[I]f
a mark imparts information directly it is descriptive. If it stands for an idea
which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods,
it is suggestive�, and quoting approvingly the district court�s reasoning that <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>platinum mortgage</span> is descriptive because
�the mental leap . . . is nearly instantaneous and� requires little imagination
to associate �platinum� with superiority and quality service�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because the borderline between descriptive and suggestive
marks is so important, three representative analyses are provided here for your
consideration.&nbsp; To give you a sense of the relative importance of various
opinions in the trademark law canon, it is worth noting that none of the
opinions excerpted here have been nearly as influential as <i>Abercrombie</i>. They
are provided instead as everyday examples from a variety of circuits of how
courts draw (sometimes unpredictably) the border between suggestiveness and descriptiveness.</p>

the outcome of the district court�s bench trial</i>].</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Goldberg, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Throughout this litigation, Zatarain's has
maintained that the term �Fish-Fri� is a suggestive mark automatically
protected from infringing uses by virtue of its registration in 1962. Oak Grove
and Visko's assert that �fish fry� is a generic term identifying a class of
foodstuffs used to fry fish; alternatively, Oak Grove and Visko's argue that
�fish fry� is merely descriptive of the characteristics of the product. The
district court found that �Fish-Fri� was a descriptive term identifying a
function of the product being sold. Having reviewed this finding under the
appropriate �clearly erroneous� standard, we affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We are mindful that �[t]he concept of
descriptiveness must be construed rather broadly.� Callman � 70.2. Whenever a
word or phrase conveys an immediate idea of the qualities, characteristics,
effect, purpose, or ingredients of a product or service, it is classified as
descriptive and cannot be claimed as an exclusive trademark. Id. � 71.1; see
Stix Products, Inc. v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., 295 F.Supp.
479, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1968). Courts and commentators have formulated a number of
tests to be used in classifying a mark as descriptive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A suitable starting place is the dictionary, for
�[t]he dictionary definition of the word is an appropriate and relevant
indication �of the ordinary significance and meaning of words' to the public.�
American Heritage Life Insurance Co. v. Heritage Life Insurance Co., 494 F.2d
3, 11 n.5 (5th Cir.1974). Webster's Third New International Dictionary 858
(1966) lists the following definitions for the term �fish fry�: �1. a picnic at
which fish are caught, fried, and eaten; .... 2. fried fish.� Thus, the basic
dictionary definitions of the term refer to the preparation and consumption of
fried fish. This is at least preliminary evidence that the term �Fish-Fri� is
descriptive of Zatarain's product in the sense that the words naturally direct
attention to the purpose or function of the product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The �imagination test� is a second standard used by
the courts to identify descriptive terms. This test seeks to measure the
relationship between the actual words of the mark and the product to which they
are applied. If a term �requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a
conclusion as to the nature of goods,� Stix Products, 295 F.Supp. at 488, it is
considered a suggestive term. Alternatively, a term is descriptive if standing
alone it conveys information as to the characteristics of the product. In this
case, mere observation compels the conclusion that a product branded �Fish-Fri�
is a prepackaged coating or batter mix applied to fish prior to cooking. The
connection between this merchandise and its identifying terminology is so close
and direct that even a consumer unfamiliar with the product would doubtless
have an idea of its purpose or function. It simply does not require an exercise
of the imagination to deduce that �Fish-Fri� is used to fry fish. Accordingly,
the term �Fish-Fri� must be considered descriptive when examined under the
�imagination test.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A third test used by courts and commentators to
classify descriptive marks is �whether competitors would be likely to need the
terms used in the trademark in describing their products.� Union Carbide Corp.
v. Ever-Ready, Inc., 531 F.2d 366, 379 (7th Cir.1976). A descriptive term
generally relates so closely and directly to a product or service that other
merchants marketing similar goods would find the term useful in identifying
their own goods. Common sense indicates that in this case merchants other than
Zatarain's might find the term �fish fry� useful in describing their own
particular batter mixes. While Zatarain's has argued strenuously that Visko's
and Oak Grove could have chosen from dozens of other possible terms in naming
their coating mix, we find this position to be without merit. As this court has
held, the fact that a term is not the only or even the most common name for a
product is not determinative, for there is no legal foundation that a product
can be described in only one fashion. There are many edible fish in the sea,
and as many ways to prepare them as there are varieties to be prepared. Even
piscatorial gastronomes would agree, however, that frying is a form of
preparation accepted virtually around the world, at restaurants starred and
unstarred. The paucity of synonyms for the words �fish� and �fry� suggests that
a merchant whose batter mix is specially spiced for frying fish is likely to
find �fish fry� a useful term for describing his product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A final barometer of the descriptiveness of a
particular term examines the extent to which a term actually has been used by
others marketing a similar service or product. This final test is closely related
to the question whether competitors are likely to find a mark useful in
describing their products. As noted above, a number of companies other than
Zatarain's have chosen the word combination �fish fry� to identify their batter
mixes. Arnaud's product, �Oyster Shrimp and Fish Fry,� has been in competition
with Zatarain's �Fish-Fri� for some ten to twenty years. When companies from A
to Z, from Arnaud to Zatarain's, select the same term to describe their similar
products, the term in question is most likely a descriptive one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The correct categorization of a given term is a
factual issue; consequently, we review the district court's findings under the
�clearly erroneous� standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52. The district court in this
case found that Zatarain's trademark �Fish-Fri� was descriptive of the function
of the product being sold. Having applied the four prevailing tests of
descriptiveness to the term �Fish-Fri,� we are convinced that the district court's
judgment in this matter is not only not clearly erroneous, but clearly correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>In a footnote, the court considered and rejected the
argument that <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>fish fry</span> was generic

itself, is not protectable. However, �[a] merely descriptive term ... can, by
acquiring a secondary meaning, i.e., becoming distinctive of the applicant's
goods ..., become a valid trademark.� Induct&#8211;O&#8211;Matic Corp. v.
Inductotherm Corp., 747 F.2d 358, 362 (6th Cir.1984). LE counters that the
�5&#8211;hour ENERGY� mark is not descriptive, but rather is distinctive, due
to the mark's suggestiveness. Such a mark �suggests rather than describes an
ingredient or characteristic of the goods and requires the observer or listener
to use imagination and perception to determine the nature of the goods.� Id. at
362.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The �5&#8211;hour ENERGY� mark could be
characterized as merely descriptive, in the sense that it simply describes a
product that will give someone five hours of energy. But that is not the end of
such an inquiry. The first question one would ask is <i>how</i> would the
energy be transferred? Through food? Through drink? Through injections? Through
pills? Through exercise? Also, one would ask what kind of energy is the mark
referring to? Food energy (measured in Calories)? Electrical energy? Nuclear
energy? With some thought, one could arrive at the conclusion that the mark
refers to an energy shot. But it is not as straightforward as NVE suggests.
Such cognitive inferences are indicative of �suggestive� rather than
descriptive marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The nature of the �5&#8211;hour ENERGY� mark
�shares a closer kinship with those marks previously designated as suggestive
than those labeled merely descriptive because of the degree of inferential
reasoning necessary for a consumer to discern� that the �5&#8211;hour ENERGY�
mark relates to an energy shot. Tumblebus v. Cranmer, 399 F.3d 754, 763 (6th
Cir.2005). The connection between �5&#8211;hour� and �ENERGY� is �not so
obvious that a consumer seeing [5&#8211;hour ENERGY] in isolation would know that
the term refers to� an energy shot rather than, for example, a battery for
electronics, an exercise program, a backup generator, or a snack for endurance
sports. Ibid. Connecting the mark �5&#8211;hour ENERGY� with the energy-shot
product requires �imagination and perception to determine the nature of the
goods.� <i>Induct&#8211;O&#8211;Matic</i>, 747 F.2d at 362.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �The line between merely descriptive and suggestive
marks is admittedly hazy and can be difficult to discern.� <i>Tumblebus</i>,
399 F.3d at 763. However, we disagree with NVE's contention that the mark is
not distinctive and thus not protectable. The �5&#8211;hour ENERGY� mark is
�suggestive.� </p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>602 F.3d 1108, 114-1121 (9th Cir. 2010)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;[This excerpt is quite lengthy and will require the

analysis will give the reader a keen sense of all the different arguments that
can be mustered on the issue of suggestiveness/descriptiveness in an

<p class=MsoNormal><i>The relevant facts are as follows: Plaintiff Zobmondo
Entertainment, LLC (�Zobmondo�) and defendant Falls Media, LLC (�Falls Media�)
both use the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>would you rather�?</span>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Falls Media first contends that the district court
erred by concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact whether
�WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is suggestive, concluding instead that the mark is
merely descriptive. A suggestive mark is one for which �a consumer must use
imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark's
significance ... the mark does not describe the product's features, but
suggests them.� Kendall&#8211;Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery,
150 F.3d 1042, 1047 n. 8 (9th Cir.1998). By contrast, a merely descriptive mark
�describes the qualities or characteristics of a good or service.� Park �N Fly,
Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194 (1985). It �define[s]
qualities or characteristics of a product in a straightforward way that
requires no exercise of the imagination to be understood.� Entrepreneur Media,
Inc. v. Smith, 279 F.3d 1135, 1141-42 (9th Cir.2002)(quoting
Kendall&#8211;Jackson, 150 F.3d at 1047 n. 8); see also Union Nat'l Bank of
Tex., Laredo, Tex. v. Union Nat'l Bank of Tex., Austin, Tex., 909 F.2d 839, 845
(5th Cir.1990) (�[I]n many cases, a descriptive term will be an adjective such
as �speedy,� �friendly,� �green,� �menthol,� or �reliable.� �). �Whether a mark
suggests or describes the goods or services of the trademark holder depends
[on] what those goods or services are[, and w]e therefore adjudge a mark's
strength by reference to the goods or services that it identifies....�
Entrepreneur Media, 279 F.3d at 1142. In distinguishing between suggestive and
descriptive marks, we are aware that �[d]eciding whether a mark is distinctive
or merely descriptive is far from an exact science and is a tricky business at
best.� Lahoti, 586 F.3d at 1197; 2 McCarthy � 11:66 (�The
descriptive-suggestive borderline is hardly a clear one�), � 11:71 (observing
that the descriptive-suggestive dichotomy is not �some kind of concrete and
objective classification system�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because Falls Media showed that �WOULD YOU RATHER
... ?� was registered without proof of secondary meaning, Falls Media was
entitled to a presumption that the mark is inherently distinctive&#8212;i.e.,
suggestive&#8212;and the burden shifted to Zobmondo to show that the mark is
�merely descriptive� by a preponderance of the evidence. Federal registration
in itself does not mean that Falls Media can necessarily survive summary
judgment solely on the basis of its registration. �[A]ssuming the defendant can
demonstrate through law, undisputed facts, or a combination thereof that the
mark is invalid, the evidentiary bubble [created by the federal registration]
bursts and the plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment. In the face of
sufficient and undisputed facts demonstrating [invalidity], the registration
loses its evidentiary significance.� Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp., 296 F.3d
778, 783 (9th Cir.2002). Nonetheless, the presumption of validity is a strong
one, and the burden on the defendant necessary to overcome that presumption at
summary judgment is heavy. See, e.g., Americana Trading, Inc. v. Russ Berrie
&amp; Co., 966 F.2d 1284, 1287 (9th Cir.1992) (reversing a district court's
grant of summary judgment because the district court �gave insufficient weight
to the presumptive effect of[the plaintiff's] federal registration.�)....
Nonetheless, while the registration adds something on the scales, we must come
to grips with an assessment of the mark itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have generally applied one or two �tests� to
differentiate between suggestive and merely descriptive marks. Because the
district court found the application of these tests, the imagination test and
the competitors' needs test, important to its summary judgment inquiry, we
examine each in turn. We stress that these tests are only �criteria offer[ing]
guidance,� Self&#8211;Realization Fellowship Church v. Ananda Church of
Self&#8211;Realization, 59 F.3d 902, 911 (9th Cir.1995), and that the burden to
show that there is no genuine issue of material fact is on the moving party,
Zobmondo, while the non-moving party, Falls Media, gets the benefit of
reasonable inferences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first, and clearly the most-used, test is known
as the �imagination� test, and asks whether �imagination or a mental leap is
required in order to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the product being
referenced.� Rudolph Int'l, Inc. v. Realys, Inc., 482 F.3d 1195, 1198 (9th
Cir.2007). For example, the mark �ENTREPRENEUR� as applied to a magazine was
descriptive, not suggestive, because �an entirely unimaginative, literal-minded
person would understand the significance of the reference.� Entrepreneur Media,
279 F.3d at 1142. On the other hand, �ROACH MOTEL� was held suggestive because
�an ordinary consumer having read or heard on television the words �roach
motel� would remember the conception ... a fanciful abode for roaches in an
establishment normally frequented by human [travelers].� Am. Home Prods. Corp.
v. Johnson Chem. Co., 589 F.2d 103, 107 (2d Cir.1978). We have said that the
imagination test is our �primary criterion� for evaluating distinctiveness.
Self&#8211;Realization, 59 F.3d at 911.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court determined that the imagination
test indicated that �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is merely descriptive as a matter
of law because it requires �no imaginative or interpretive leap to understand
that this phrase is the main aspect of the game to which it is affixed.� Falls
Media argues that the district court erred because multistage reasoning is
needed to link the mark to the �essential nature of these products ... that the
choices are ridiculous, bizarre, or themed and that they are limited to a
two-option format.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We reject Falls Media's argument in part. The imagination
test does not ask what information about the product could be derived from a
mark, but rather whether �a mental leap is required � to understand the mark's
relationship to the product. Rudolph Int'l, 482 F.3d at 1198. Our prior
precedent makes it clear that merely descriptive marks need not describe the
�essential nature� of a product; it is enough that the mark describe some
aspect of the product. See, e.g., Bada Co. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 426
F.2d 8, 11 (9th Cir.1970) (holding the mark �Micro&#8211;Precision� merely
descriptive when applied to wheel balancers and weights).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But we conclude that the district court erred in
concluding that the imagination test indicates that �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is
merely descriptive as a matter of law. We cannot look the entire mark up in a
dictionary; there is no literal meaning of the �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� phrase,
given that the words precede an ellipse; one may infer that there is a
question, but only imagination can tell us that the question will serve up a
bizarre or humorous choice. See Surgicenters of Am., Inc. v. Med. Dental
Surgeries, Co., 601 F.2d 1011, 1015 n. 11 (9th Cir.1979) (�While not
determinative, dictionary definitions are relevant and often persuasive in
determining how a term is understood by the consuming public ....�); cf.
Entrepreneur Media, 279 F.3d at 1142 (holding that �Entrepreneur� is merely
descriptive as the name of a magazine because an �entirely unimaginative,
literal-minded person� would understand its meaning). On the one hand,
consumers who already understand the phrase �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� to refer
specifically to a game of questions involving bizarre or humorous choices might
not consider the mark very suggestive as the name of a board game, but to
consumers who do not share such an understanding, �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is
simply the first three words of an open-ended question. For those consumers,
the mark �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� may not �describe� anything, except that a
question is asked, and may indeed require imagination and multistage reasoning
to understand the mark's relationship to the game to which it is affixed. See Rudolph
Int'l, 482 F.3d at 1198; Self&#8211;Realization, 59 F.3d at 911 (observing that
the mark �recovery� in the self&#8211;help context is descriptive, but the same
mark is suggestive when used as the name of a business teaching counselors to
teach self-help because �[the] extra step constitutes the difference between
descriptiveness and suggestiveness�). Given the record before us, which lacks
comprehensive consumer surveys, we cannot say with confidence precisely what
consumers will understand the phrase �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� to mean, nor are
we confident that our own understanding of the phrase is an adequate
substitute.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[10]</span></span></span></a>�With
respect to a registered mark ... the putative infringer's burden is not simply
to show that the mark describes a feature of the trademark holder's product;
rather, it must show that consumers regard the mark as merely descriptive of
that product.� Borinquen Biscuit Corp. v. M.V. Trading Corp., 443 F.3d 112, 119
(1st Cir.2006). When we give all reasonable inferences to Falls Media, and credit
its evidence as true, we conclude that the imagination test is inconclusive by
itself to determine if the challenged mark is descriptive or suggestive of a
board game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The second test, known as the �competitors' needs�
test, �focuses on the extent to which a mark is actually needed by competitors
to identify their goods or services.� Rodeo Collection, Ltd. v. W. Seventh, 812
F.2d 1215, 1218 (9th Cir.1987). If competitors have a great need to use a mark,
the mark is probably descriptive; on the other hand, if �the suggestion made by
the mark is so remote and subtle that it is really not likely to be needed by
competitive sellers to describe their goods or services[,] this tends to
indicate that the mark is merely suggestive.� Id. The competitors' needs test
is related to the imagination test, �because the more imagination that is
required to associate a mark with a product or service, the less likely the
words used will be needed by competitors to describe their products or
services.� Id.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court concluded that the competitors'
needs test was �difficult to apply in this case� and declined to consider it
because these tests �are merely factors to consider� and other tests favored
Zobmondo. Falls Media argues that this was error, and in this case we agree.
Drawing all inferences in favor of Falls Media, the competitors' needs test
strongly favored Falls Media's argument that �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is
suggestive. Falls Media proffered significant evidence suggesting that its
competitors do not need to use �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� to fairly describe
their products. Perhaps most important is the experience of Zobmondo itself.
Zobmondo identified 135 possible alternative names for its game during
development. Also, Zobmondo marketed and sold its game and a related book for a
period of time without using the phrase �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� (instead using
the name �The Outrageous Game of Bizarre Choices�), and another board game
company used the name �Would You Prefer?� during the same time period. These
titles are not linguistically inferior to �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?�. Cf.
Entrepreneur Media, 279 F.3d at 1143 (observing that others need the term
�entrepreneur� because �[w]e are not aware of, nor has EMI suggested, any
synonym for the word�). In the face of this evidence, credited as true on
summary judgment, it's difficult to say that Zobmondo necessarily needs to use
�WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� for its version of the board game of bizarre or
humorous choices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Zobmondo argues that �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is
needed to fairly describe its products because the meaning of the phrase �WOULD
YOU RATHER ... ?� is entrenched in the minds of consumers in a way that renders
other possible marks inherently inferior. This argument, however, depends on a
disputed issue of fact regarding the meaning of the phrase to consumers, an
issue that we have already suggested cannot adequately be decided at summary
judgment on the basis of abstract theorizing alone. Giving all reasonable
inferences from the evidence in favor of Falls Media, competitors do not need
to use �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� to describe their products. They can say �Would
you prefer� or �Would you most like� or use some other verbal formula to convey
a choice of alternatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court also employed a third test,
known as the �extent-of-use� test, which evaluates �the extent to which other
sellers have used the mark on similar merchandise.� 2 McCarthy � 11:69; see
also 555&#8211;1212.com, Inc. v. Commc'n House Int'l, Inc., 157 F.Supp.2d 1084,
1089 (N.D.Cal.2001) (�[I]n determining whether a word has a descriptive or
suggestive significance as applied to a commercial service, it is proper to
take notice of the extent to which others in a similar commercial context use
the word.�). Zobmondo introduced evidence of six published books with the words
�would you rather� in the title, as well as printouts from Google.com search
results using the phrase. Falls Media argues that the district court improperly
credited this disputed evidence over Falls Media's objections without considering
whether the words �would you rather� were used as a trademark and without
making all inferences in Falls Media's favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We are not aware of any prior case in our circuit
employing the extent-of-use test as a controlling measure of trademark
validity, and we need not do so here. If, as we see it, a summary judgment is
disfavored by both the imagination test and the needs test, then extent of use
at most could only be one factor to be considered, and could not command a
summary judgment in the face of disputed facts about how a mark might be
perceived by consumers. Extensive use of a mark by third parties might indicate
that the mark is merely descriptive of a given class of products. See, e.g., Sec.
Ctr., Ltd. v. First Nat'l Sec. Ctrs., 750 F.2d 1295, 1300 (5th Cir.1985)
(concluding that the mark �security center� is descriptive in part because of
�the number of enterprises throughout the nation that use �security center� in
some form�). But having determined for purposes of summary judgment that the
imagination test is inconclusive and that the competitors' needs test favors
suggestiveness, we are not persuaded that the result of the extent-of-use test,
based on Zobmondo's proffered evidence, renders �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� merely
descriptive as a matter of law. Zobmondo's evidence of third party use is
relevant, and may be considered by the trier of fact. But it must be measured,
not merely against the results of abstract theoretical tests, but against the
presumption of validity afforded to Falls Media's registered mark and against
any other evidence of distinctiveness that Falls Media has proffered.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the district court that this evidence
collectively has some persuasive weight, but we do not believe it is �so
one-sided that there can be no doubt about how the question [regarding the
distinctiveness of the mark] should be answered.� Packman v. Chi. Tribune Co.,
267 F.3d 628, 637 (7th Cir.2001). That �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is an �utterly
obvious� title for a book does not necessarily mean the mark is an equally
obvious title in the context of a board game. See 2 McCarthy � 11:71 (�It must
be kept in mind that a term that is in one category for a particular product
may be in a quite different category for another product.�). The statement that
�WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is more descriptive than �Zobmondo� does not exclude
the possibility that it is still suggestive, nor does Pressman's comment that
�WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� gives a person a �good idea� of what the game is
about; a mark can be suggestive and still convey information about a product.
See, e.g., 2 McCarthy � 11:72 (listing marks that have been found �suggestive,�
including �CITIBANK� for an urban bank, �CLASSIC COLA� for a soft drink,
�DIAL&#8211;A&#8211;MATTRESS� for mattress sales, and �FLORIDA TAN� for suntan
lotion). Gomberg's e-mail that purchasers are generally familiar with the
�WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� concept says nothing about how board-game
consumers&#8212;a larger group than ultimate purchasers of the �WOULD YOU
RATHER ... ?� game&#8212;understand the mark. Viewing this evidence in the
light most favorable to Falls Media, all of this evidence suggests only Falls
Media's belief regarding how consumers perceive the mark, and is not
necessarily conclusive of how consumers in fact perceive the mark. And
Zobmondo's evidence of third-party use, without contextual information such as
sales figures and distribution locations, falls short of establishing a
long-standing consumer understanding of the �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� concept
for purposes of summary judgment.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

wholly upon their usage� including whether the marks �were actually used by
third parties, that they were well promoted or that they were recognized by
consumers�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Falls Media has not rested solely on its federal
registration to survive summary judgment. Falls Media proffered the testimony
of a game-industry expert, Philip E. Orbanes, who said that �WOULD YOU RATHER
... ?� had never been used as the title of a board game before Zobmondo's entry
into the market. The district court concluded that this testimony was �entirely
irrelevant� because the issue was whether the societal concept of a �WOULD YOU
RATHER ... ?� dilemma predated Falls Media's use of the mark. We disagree. The
ultimate issue at summary judgment was whether the mark �WOULD YOU RATHER ...
?� should receive trademark protection as applied to Falls Media's board and
card games. The fact that the mark had not been used previously to describe a
board game is relevant to that inquiry; it suggests that competitors do not
find the mark useful in describing their products. See, e.g., Sec. Ctr., 750
F.2d at 1300 (�We look into actual and likely use of a mark in order to
determine whether its protection, i.e., its exclusion from the language freely
available for commercial use, interferes with competition among providers of the
same product or service.�). Zobmondo asks us to conclude that the mark is
merely descriptive on a board game because of Zobmondo's showing that
consumers' understanding of the �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� game concept predates
the parties' use of the mark. But that idea does not render Orbanes's testimony
irrelevant. To the contrary, Orbanes's testimony about lack of third-party use
on games tends to negate the inference that Zobmondo seeks to establish: that
the mark is widely understood by consumers to refer to a type of question game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Other evidence in the record also supports Falls
Media's claim that �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� could be seen by consumers as
suggestive. For example, that Zobmondo included descriptive information on its
game boxes after it began using the �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� mark may suggest
that Zobmondo itself thought that the mark did not fully describe its products.<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[12]</span></span></span></a> And Zobmondo's attempt to
acquire trademark rights in the mark supports an inference that Zobmondo
believed, at one time, that the mark was inherently distinctive.<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[13]</span></span></span></a> This evidence is no less
relevant to the distinctiveness inquiry than the evidence that persons
associated with Falls Media thought the mark provided descriptive information.
Both the evidence of Zobmondo's trademark applications and the evidence that
some persons in business relations with Falls Media thought the mark
descriptive demonstrate that there is a factual contest at bottom in assessing
the descriptiveness or suggestiveness of the �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� mark,
rendering that issue unsuitable for a summary judgment determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Looking at the totality of evidence proffered by
Zobmondo and Falls Media and taking into account the �strong presumption�
accorded to Falls Media's federal registration, we conclude that there is a
genuine issue of material fact whether �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� is inherently
distinctive to consumers.</p>

indicate the purity of the moisturizing content of Lauder's product, or to
imply an enduring effect. Or, as the district court found, it could be read as
indicating that the bottle contains nothing but time-release moisturizer or
that the product moisturizes continuously until removed or worn off. All of
these interpretations require some stretch of the imagination. And of course,
as the court found, if the term �100%� is simply viewed as the brand of
time-release moisturizer, it plainly is suggestive.�).</p>

<h5><a name="_Toc392009904"><a name="_Toc365129309">iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special
Rules for Classification of Certain Kinds of Trademarks</a> </a></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many special rules that guide the <i>Abercrombie</i>
classification of certain kinds of trademarks.&nbsp; Nearly all of them are
detailed in the PTO�s <i>Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure</i> (�TMEP�),
which is an excellent resource for the trademark lawyer, particularly one who
specializes in trademark �prosecution,� i.e., the process of registering
trademarks at the PTO (tmep.uspto.gov).&nbsp; Among the most important of these
special rules are the following:&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h6><a name="_Toc392009905"><a name="_Toc365129310">&#8900;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descriptiveness
of Geographic Terms</a></a></h6>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we will see through the course of this Part,&nbsp; Lanham
Act� 2, 15 U.S.C. �1052, has several provisions giving special treatment to
geographic terms.&nbsp; Consider for the moment � 2(e)(2), which provides: �No
trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the
goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on
account of its nature unless it ... (e) Consists of a mark which ... (2) when
used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is primarily
geographically descriptive of them, except as indications of regional origin
may be registrable under section 1054 of this title.�&nbsp; Such �primarily
geographically descriptive� marks may only be registered or otherwise protected
upon a showing of secondary meaning.&nbsp; Lanham Act � 2(f), 15 U.S.C.
�1052(f).&nbsp; The TTAB has established a relatively straightforward
three-part test for determining whether a mark is �primarily geographically
descriptive.�&nbsp; The mark will fall into this category if: �(1) the primary
significance of the mark is a generally known geographic location;&nbsp; (2) the
goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark; <u>and</u> (3)
purchasers would be likely to believe that the goods or services originate in
the geographic place identified in the mark.� TMEP �1210.01(a).&nbsp; <i>See,
e.g</i>., <i>In re Carolina Apparel</i>, 48 USPQ2d 1542 (TTAB 1998) (finding <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>carolina apparel</span> for clothing stores in
North Carolina to be primarily geographically descriptive); <i>In re Brouwerij
Nacional Balashi NV</i>, 80 U.S.P.Q.2d 1820 (TTAB 2006) (finding <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>balashi beer</span> and <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>balashi</span> for beer made in the Balashi neighborhood of the
Santa Cruz district of Aruba to be not primarily geographically descriptive
where the term is �so obscure or remote that purchasers of beer in the United
States would typically fail to recognize the term as indicating the
geographical source of applicant's goods.�); <i>University Book Store v. Board
of Regents of University of Wisconsin System</i>, 33 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (TTAB
1994) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>wisconsin badgers</span> for
apparel to be not primarily geographically descriptive where consumers would
not perceive the primary significance of the mark as a whole as designating a
particular geographic location).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third prong of the PGD test calls for evidence that consumers
would make a �goods/place association� (or �service/place association�) between
(1) the geographic location referred to by the mark and (2) the goods sold
under the mark.&nbsp; Note, importantly, that if the geographic location is
�neither obscure nor remote,� TMEP �1210.04, and the goods actually originate
from that location, then this goods/place association may ordinarily be
presumed.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>In re Spirits of New Merced, LLC</i>, 85
U.S.P.Q.2d 1614 (TTAB 2007) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>yosemite
beer</span> to be primarily geographically descriptive where the registration
applicant�s beer was brewed near Yosemite National Park and applicant failed to
overcome presumption of goods/place association; �[s]ince the goods originate
at or near [Yosemite National Park], we can presume an association of
applicant�s beer with the park.�).&nbsp; <i>But see</i> <i>In re Mankovitz</i>,
90 USPQ2d 1246 (TTAB 2009) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>the
montecito diet</span> for a diet system to be not primarily geographically
descriptive where evidence of goods/place association consisted only of the
fact that the registration applicant lived in Montecito, California; �it would
be speculation on our part to reach the conclusion that the goods or services
originate there or that the public would understand that there is a goods/place
relationship�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h6><a name="_Toc392009906"><a name="_Toc365129311">&#8900;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surnames</a></a></h6>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as it does with geographic marks, � 2 of the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. �1052, also explicitly addresses the protectability of
surnames.&nbsp; It states: �No trademark by which the goods of the applicant
may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on
the principal register on account of its nature unless it ... (e) Consists of a
mark which ... (4) is primarily merely a surname.�&nbsp; Surnames may be
registered only upon a showing of acquired distinctiveness under � 2(f), 15
U.S.C. �1052(f).&nbsp; As the TMEP explains, � 2(e)(4) �reflects the common law
that exclusive rights in a surname per se cannot be established without
evidence of long and exclusive use that changes its significance to the public
from that of a surname to that of a mark for particular goods or services. The
common law also recognizes that surnames are shared by more than one
individual, each of whom may have an interest in using his surname in business;
and, by the requirement for evidence of distinctiveness, the law, in effect,
delays appropriation of exclusive rights in the name.�&nbsp; TMEP �1211.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what qualifies as �primarily merely a surname�?&nbsp;
�Fiore,� �Hackler,� and �Bird� are used as surnames, but they have been deemed
not �primarily merely a surname� under trademark law.&nbsp; <i>In re Isabella
Fiore LLC</i>, 75 USPQ2d 1564 (TTAB 2005); <i>In re United Distillers plc</i>,
56 USPQ2d 1220 (TTAB 2000); <i>Fisher Radio Corp. v. Bird Elec. Corp</i>., 162
USPQ 265 (TTAB 1969).&nbsp; The TTAB has established five factors to be considered
in determining whether the relevant purchasing public perceives the primary
significance of a term to be that of a surname: (1) whether the surname is rare;
(2) whether the term is the surname of anyone connected with the applicant; (3)
whether the term has any recognized meaning other than as a surname; (4)
whether it has the �look and feel� of a surname; (5) [in cases of stylized,
rather than standard character marks,] whether the stylization of lettering is
distinctive enough to create a separate commercial impression.&nbsp; <i>In re
Benthin Mgmt. GmbH</i>, 37 USPQ2d 1332, 1333-1334 (TTAB 1995) (finding that the
mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>benthin</span> in stylized lettering
inside an oval design would not be perceived as primarily merely a surname).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about historic surnames?&nbsp; �A term with surname
significance may not be primarily merely a surname if that term also identifies
a historical place or person.�&nbsp; TMEP �1211.01(a)(iv).&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>.,
<i>Lucien Piccard Watch Corp. v. Since 1868 Crescent Corp</i>., 314 F. Supp.
329, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) (finding that <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>da
vinci</span> for jewelry and leather goods is not primarily merely a surname
for purposes of Section 2(e)(4)).&nbsp; <i>But see In re Champion Int�l Corp</i>.,
229 USPQ 550, 551 (TTAB 1985) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McKinley</span>
to be primarily merely a surname despite being the surname of William McKinley,
the 25th President of the United States).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h6><a name="_Toc392009907"><a name="_Toc365129312">&#8900;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-English
Words: The Doctrine of �Foreign Equivalents�</a></a></h6>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�The foreign equivalent of a merely descriptive English word
is no more registrable than the English word itself.�&nbsp; TMEP �1209.03(g).&nbsp;
Thus, �lait,� �leche,� and �Milch� as brand names for milk would be deemed
generic, and �frais,� �fresca,� and �frisch� as brand names for milk would
likely be deemed descriptive and require secondary meaning to be
protected.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>In re Tokutake Indus. C</i>o., 87 USPQ2d
1697 (TTAB 2008) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>ayumi</span>,
meaning �walking,� and its Japanese character equivalent to be merely
descriptive for footwear); <i>In re Oriental Daily News, Inc</i>., 230 USPQ 637
(TTAB 1986) (finding Chinese characters meaning �Oriental Daily News� to be merely
descriptive of newspapers).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The doctrine of foreign equivalents is riddled with
limitations and exceptions, however.&nbsp; Among these are, first, that �[t]he
doctrine should be applied only when it is likely that the ordinary American
purchaser would stop and translate the foreign word into its English
equivalent.�&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>In re Pan Tex Hotel Corp</i>., 190 U.S.P.Q.
109 (TTAB 1976) (finding that <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>la posada</span>
for a hotel and restaurant is not descriptive because it is unlikely that
consumers will translate the name into English).&nbsp; <i>But see</i> <i>In re
Hag Aktiengesellschaft</i>, 155 U.S.P.Q. 598 (TTAB 1967) (finding <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>kaba</span>, meaning coffee in Serbian and
Ukranian, to be descriptive for coffee).&nbsp; <i>Cf</i>. <i>Palm Bay Imports
v. Veuve Clicquot</i>, 396 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding that <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>veuve clicquot</span> is not confusingly
similar to ��The Widow,�� since most American consumers won�t know that
��veuve�� means ��widow�� in French).&nbsp; Second, �foreign words from dead or
obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they
should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes.� TMEP �1209.03(g).&nbsp;
This limitation appears to be very rarely applied, however.&nbsp; Third, as the
TMEP tries to explain, �marks comprised of a term from a foreign language used
with an English term may be found registrable if the commercial impression
created by the combination differs from that which would be created by two
English words.�&nbsp; The representative case here is <i>In re Johanna Farms
Inc</i>., 8 USPQ2d 1408 (TTAB 1988) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>la
yogurt</span> for yogurt to be registrable without showing of secondary
meaning).&nbsp; <i>See also</i> <i>In re Le Sorbet, Inc</i>., 228 U.S.P.Q. 27 (TTAB
1985) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>le sorbet</span> for
sorbet to be descriptive because it is a foreign-language term preceded by a
foreign-language article).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h6><a name="_Toc392009908"><a name="_Toc365129313">&#8900;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acronyms</a></a></h6>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The general rule is that an acronym will be classified as
descriptive or generic if (1) the wording it stands for is merely descriptive
of or generic as to the goods or services, and (2) relevant purchasers
understand the acronym to be �substantially synonymous� with the merely
descriptive or generic wording it represents.&nbsp; TMEP � 1209.03(h).&nbsp; <i>See,
e.g</i>., <i>In re Thomas Nelson, Inc</i>., 97 USPQ2d 1712, 1715 (TTAB 2011) (finding
&nbsp;NKJV to be substantially synonymous with merely descriptive term �New King
James Version� and thus merely descriptive of bibles); <i>Baroness Small
Estates, Inc. v. Am. Wine Trade, Inc</i>., 104 USPQ2d 1224, 1230-31 (TTAB 2012)
(finding CMS to be inherently distinctive on the ground that it is not
substantially synonymous with the grape varietals cabernet, merlot, and syrah
and is thus not merely descriptive of wine).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h6><a name="_Toc392009909"><a name="_Toc365129314">&#8900;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domain
Names and Top-Level Domain Designations</a></a></h6>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The general rule is that a trademark is unprotectable if it
consists simply of a generic term followed by a top-level domain designator
(such as �.com�, �.org�, or �.biz�), and protectable only upon a showing of
secondary meaning if the mark consists of a merely descriptive term followed by
a TLD designator.&nbsp; The theory is that a domain name �function[s] to
indicate an address on the World Wide Web, and, therefore, generally serve[s]
no source-indicating function.�&nbsp; TMEP �1209.03(m).&nbsp; Just as a company
cannot claim trademark protection for its street address without showing that
the address has developed secondary meaning (e.g., �1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino,
CA 95014�), so the company cannot claim its descriptive domain name as a
protectable trademark without showing the same. &nbsp;<i>See, e.g</i>., <i>In
re Oppedahl &amp; Larson LLP</i>, 373 F.3d 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (finding <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>patents.com</span> to be merely descriptive of �[c]omputer
software for managing a database of records and for tracking the status of the
records by means of the Internet�); <i>In re Steelbuilding.com</i>, 415 F.3d
1293, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>steelbuilding.com</span>
to be �highly descriptive� but not generic for �computerized on line retail
services in the field of pre-engineered metal buildings and roofing systems�).&nbsp;
And if the domain name is generic, it is unredeemable.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>In
re 1800mattress.com IP, LLC</i>, 586 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (finding <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>mattress.com</span> to be generic for �online
retail store services in the field of mattresses, beds, and bedding�); <i>In re
Reed Elsevier Properties, Inc</i>., 482 F.3d 1376, 82 U.S.P.Q.2d 1378 (Fed.
Cir. 2007) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>lawyers.com</span> to
be generic for �online interactive database information exchange in the fields
of law, legal news, and legal services�).</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009910"><a name="_Toc365129316">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquired
Distinctiveness of Source</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A descriptive, and thus non-inherently distinctive, mark may
qualify for protection if it is shown to have developed �acquired
distinctiveness� or �secondary meaning� (the two terms mean the same thing) as a
designation of source.&nbsp; For example, though the term �American Airlines�
is highly descriptive of an airline service based in the U.S., the term has
developed enormous secondary meaning as a designation of source through use and
advertising.&nbsp; As the Supreme Court commented in <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
v. Samara Bros., Inc</i>., 529 U.S. 205 (2000), the term �secondary meaning� is
not as clear as it could be:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The phrase �secondary meaning� originally arose in the
context of word marks, where it served to distinguish the source-identifying
meaning from the ordinary, or �primary,� meaning of the word. �Secondary
meaning� has since come to refer to the acquired, source-identifying meaning of
a nonword mark as well. It is often a misnomer in that context, since nonword
marks ordinarily have no �primary� meaning. Clarity might well be served by
using the term �acquired meaning� in both the word-mark and the nonword-mark contexts&#8212;but
in this opinion we follow what has become the conventional terminology.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 211 fn.&nbsp; Indeed, most
trademark practitioners still continue as a matter of tradition to use the term
�secondary meaning� rather than �acquired distinctiveness.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each circuit typically uses its own multifactor test to
determine if a mark has developed secondary meaning.&nbsp; Here are some
examples of these tests:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Second Circuit: �(1) advertising expenditures, (2) consumer
studies linking the mark to a source, (3) unsolicited media coverage of the
product, (4) sales success, (5) attempts to plagiarize the mark, and (6) length
and exclusivity of the mark�s use.� <i>Genesee Brewing Co. v. Stroh Brewing Co</i>.,
124 F.3d 137, 143 n.4 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Third Circuit: �We have identified an eleven-item, non-exhaustive
list of factors relevant to the factual determination whether a term has
acquired secondary meaning: (1) the extent of sales and advertising leading to
buyer association; (2) length of use; (3) exclusivity of use; (4) the fact of
copying; (5) customer surveys; (6) customer testimony; (7) the use of the mark
in trade journals; (8) the size of the company; (9) the number of sales; (10)
the number of customers; and, (11) actual confusion.� <i>E.T. Browne Drug Co.
v. Cococare Products, Inc</i>., 538 F.3d 185, 199 (3d&nbsp; Cir. 2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Morris Sheppard Arnold, Circuit Judge</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A group of affiliated companies, Frosty Treats,
Inc., Frosty Treats of Louisville, Inc., Frosty Treats Wholesale, Inc., and
Frosty Treats of Atlanta, Inc., collectively known as �Frosty Treats,� sued
Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc., (SCEA) asserting, inter alia, claims
under state and federal law for trademark infringement and dilution, and for
unfair competition. Frosty Treats premised these claims upon SCEA's depiction
of an ice cream truck and clown character in SCEA's Twisted Metal video game
series. Frosty Treats contends that because the ice cream truck in those games
bears a clown graphic that it alleges is similar to the one on its ice cream
trucks, and, in the final game, is labeled with its brand identifier, �Frosty
Treats,� the games create a likelihood of confusion as to Frosty Treats's
sponsorship of or affiliation with the games. See 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a). The
district court granted SCEA's motion for summary judgment on all of Frosty
Treats's claims, and Frosty Treats appeals. We affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Frosty Treats asserts that the district court erred
by finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and holding as a
matter of law that the �Frosty Treats� mark was not protectable�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Frosty Treats argues first that the district court
erred by holding that its �Frosty Treats� mark is not entitled to trademark
protection because it is generic, or, in the alternative, descriptive without
secondary meaning. Frosty Treats asserts that the mark is suggestive, or, at
worst, descriptive with an acquired secondary meaning, and therefore
protectible. We disagree. At best, the �Frosty Treats� mark is descriptive, and
there is no basis for concluding that it has acquired secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The stylized words �Frosty Treats� appear toward
the rear of the passenger's side of plaintiffs' ice cream vans as pink capital
letters with frost on the upper portion of each letter. See Figure 1 (depicting
the �Frosty Treats� decal). The decal on which these words appear is
approximately nine inches wide by four inches high and is surrounded by decals
of the frozen products that the Frosty Treats vans sell. See Figure 2
(depicting a typical Frosty Treats van).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To determine whether this mark is protectible, we
must first categorize it. �A term for which trademark protection is claimed
will fall in one of four categories: (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3)
suggestive, or (4) arbitrary or fanciful.� WSM, Inc. v. Hilton, 724 F.2d 1320,
1325 (8th Cir.1984). A generic mark refers to the common name or nature of an
article, and is therefore not entitled to trademark protection. Co&#8211;Rect
Prods., Inc. v. Marvy! Adver. Photography, Inc., 780 F.2d 1324, 1329 (8th
Cir.1985). A term is descriptive if it conveys an �immediate idea of the
ingredients, qualities or characteristics of the goods,� Stuart Hall Co., Inc.
v. Ampad Corp., 51 F.3d 780, 785&#8211;86 (8th Cir.1995), and is protectible only
if shown to have acquired a secondary meaning. Co&#8211;Rect Prods., 780 F.2d
at 1329. Suggestive marks, which require imagination, thought, and perception
to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the goods, and arbitrary or fanciful
marks, are entitled to protection regardless of whether they have acquired
secondary meaning. See id.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If it is not generic, the phrase �Frosty Treats�
is, at best, descriptive. Frosty Treats is in the business of selling frozen
desserts out of ice cream trucks. �Frosty Treats� conveys an immediate idea of
the qualities and characteristics of the goods that it sells. No imagination,
thought, or perception is required to reach a conclusion as to the nature of
its goods. To prevail, therefore, Frosty Treats must demonstrate that the mark
has acquired a secondary meaning. �Secondary meaning is an association formed
in the minds of consumers between the mark and the source or origin of the
product.� Id. at 1330. To establish secondary meaning, Frosty Treats must show
that �Frosty Treats� serves to identify its goods and distinguish them from
those of others. Id. Secondary meaning does not require the consumer to
identify a source by name but does require that the public recognize the mark
and associate it with a single source. Stuart Hall, 51 F.3d at 789; see
Heartland Bank v. Heartland Home Fin., Inc., 335 F.3d 810, 818&#8211;19 (8th
Cir.2003) (Smith, J., concurring).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The record, when viewed in favor of Frosty Treats,
demonstrates that SCEA is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this
issue. Frosty Treats has failed to put forth more than a scintilla of evidence
that the public recognizes its �Frosty Treats� mark and associates it with a
single source. Frosty Treats claims that its survey evidence demonstrates that
the term �Frosty Treats� has acquired secondary meaning, but, if anything, it
indicates the opposite. In the survey, respondents were shown images of the
Frosty Treats ice cream van and asked, �Are you familiar with or have you ever
seen or heard of this before?� Forty-seven percent responded affirmatively.
They were then asked what they knew about the van. The respondents most
frequently mentioned that it sold ice cream. Only one percent of the
respondents in the survey mentioned Frosty Treats by name. There is no
indication in the record that the survey respondents (apart from the one
percent) were familiar with the vans because of the small nine-by-four-inch
�Frosty Treats� decal on the rear portion of the side of the van, the only
place where the phrase �Frosty Treats� appears on the vehicle. This decal,
moreover, is surrounded by numerous other decals comprising the van's menu
board. See Figure 2. Frosty Treats's survey provides no basis to conclude that
the respondents associated the van with a single source as opposed to simply a
generic ice cream truck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although direct evidence such as consumer testimony
or surveys are most probative of secondary meaning, it can also be proven by
circumstantial evidence. See Heartland Bank, 335 F.3d at 819&#8211;20 (Smith,
J., concurring). Circumstantial evidence such as the exclusivity, length and
manner of use of the mark; the amount and manner of advertising; the amount of
sales and number of customers; the plaintiff's established place in the market;
and the existence of intentional copying could also establish secondary
meaning. See id. (citing 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks &amp;
Unfair Competition �� 15:30, 15:60, 15:61, 15.66, 15.70 (4th ed.1999)). But the
circumstantial evidence that Frosty Treats offered to establish secondary
meaning also fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We recognize that the application of some of these
criteria to the facts of this case may militate in favor of a finding of
secondary meaning in the mind of a reasonable juror. For instance, there is
evidence that Frosty Treats has used the term in a continuous and substantially
exclusive manner since 1991. Cf. Stuart Hall, 51 F.3d at 789&#8211;90.
Furthermore, the record reflects that Frosty Treats, although a relatively
small company, is nevertheless one of the largest ice cream truck street
vendors in the nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the other hand, there is no evidence that SCEA
intentionally copied the term. Most significantly, the record does not contain
sufficient evidence for a juror to conclude that Frosty Treats engages in
advertising or publication of the �Frosty Treats� mark to an extent that would
be effective in having the public recognize it and equate it with a single
source. See Co&#8211;Rect Prods., 780 F.2d at 1330; Heartland Bank, 335 F.3d at
820 (Smith, J., concurring). In fact, Frosty Treats does not even prominently
display the �Frosty Treats� mark on its street-vending vans, which according to
its brief is the primary way that it advertises the phrase. As mentioned earlier,
the phrase appears on the vans as a nine-by-four-inch decal that is surrounded
by numerous other decals of frozen desserts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Furthermore, SCEA submitted indirect evidence that
the term �Frosty Treats� has not acquired secondary meaning. SCEA's expert
conducted a survey of 204 children and 200 adults who had purchased ice cream
from an ice cream truck in Frosty Treats's largest markets. When asked to
volunteer the names of any ice cream trucks that they had purchased ice cream
from, not one recalled the name �Frosty Treats.� The evidence as a whole simply
does not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that the phrase �Frosty
Treats� has acquired a secondary meaning. Accordingly, it is not protectible
under trademark law.</p>

likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of SCEA�s video game</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants and Plaintiff both conducted surveys to
test the secondary meaning of the four families of Cartier watches at issue.

<p class=MsoNormal>a. Defendants' Expert: Mr. Harry O'Neill</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants retained Mr. Harry O'Neill, Vice
Chairman of Roper ASW.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[14]</span></span></span></a>
Mr. O'Neill's report is hereinafter referenced as the �Roper Report.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Roper Report was created by intercepting
shoppers at six shopping malls throughout the country: Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. O'Neill attempted to pick malls
with �relatively upscale stores� in order to maximize the likelihood of
identifying survey participants who represented the appropriate population.
O'Neill concluded that a mall that was anchored by Sears or Kmart, for example,
would be unlikely to be frequented by consumers in the luxury watch market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the malls, shoppers were intercepted and
screened to determine their eligibility to participate. Shoppers who were under
18, did not have their glasses or contact lenses available but relied on them,
or who worked for an advertising company, market research company, or watch
retailer or manufacturer were ineligible to be surveyed. Id. Shoppers were
further asked whether or not they owned a watch worth at least $2,500. If so,
they were qualified to answer the survey's questions. If not, they were asked:
�How likely is it that you would consider buying a fine watch&#8212;one that
would cost at least $2,500&#8212;in the next couple of years&#8212;very likely,
fairly likely, not very likely or not at all likely?� Those who responded
indicated that they were �very likely� or �fairly likely� qualified to
participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Eligible participants were then shown pictures of a
Cartier Tank Francaise, a Cartier Tank Americaine, a Cartier Panthere, and five
other watches made by other manufacturers, namely, Chopard, Rolex, Tag Heuer,
Movado and Bvlgari. With each picture, a participant was asked: �Do you
associate this style or design with the watches of one or more than one
company?� If so, although unnecessary to establish secondary meaning, as an
�added extra attraction,� participants were asked a second, follow-up question
as to whether they recognized to which particular company the watch belonged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The results of the Roper study are as follows: 38%
of the respondents associated the style or design of the Tank Americaine with
one company (with 13% correctly identifying Cartier as that company); 34% of
the respondents said that they associated the style or design of the Tank
Francaise with one company (with 13% correctly identifying Cartier as that
company); 31% associated the Panthere style or design with one company (with
13% correctly identifying Cartier as that company). Based on these figures in
the Roper Report, O'Neill concludes that a significant portion of the
purchasing public does not associate the style or design of the watches at
issue with Cartier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> What is noteworthy to the Court, however, is the
considerable discrepancy in findings at the Atlanta mall vis a vis the results
obtained in surveying shoppers at the other five malls. Of the six malls
involved in creating the Roper Report, only the Atlanta mall was anchored by
upscale retail establishments. Whereas the Atlanta Mall was anchored by Neiman
Marcus and Bloomingdales, the Boston mall was not anchored by any high-end
stores, although there was one within five minutes' walking distance, the
Chicago mall was anchored by Marshall Fields and Carson Pirie Scott and the
Dallas mall was anchored by a Dillar Folis and a Mervins. Further, in Atlanta,
69% of survey respondents owned a watch worth at least $2,500, compared to the
41% of respondents at the other locales. For those who did not already own a
fine watch, 55% of the participants were �very likely� to purchase one in the
near future, compared to 15% of the participants who answered in similar
fashion at the other malls. Accordingly, the court concludes that the
population of survey respondents at the Atlanta mall was the most
representative of the Cartier consumer population. Here, 63% of the
participants associated the style and design of the Tank Francaise with one
company, 60% of respondents associated the Tank Americaine with one company,
and 60% associated the style or design of the Panthere with one company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b. Plaintiffs' Expert: Dr. Sidney Lirtzman</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Lirtzman criticized the Roper Report on the
grounds that it surveyed the wrong population insofar as it failed to
distinguish between those �very likely� to purchase an expensive, luxury
timepiece in the near future, and those who were �fairly likely� to make such a
purchase. He testified that the survey results from Atlanta indicate that if
the Roper Report had been conducted exclusively at �high end malls� and
included only those persons more resolute about their intentions of buying a
fine watch, the numbers of participants identifying the style or design of the
three Cartier watches with one company would have been higher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To support this conclusion, Lirtzman conducted his
own survey designed to parallel O'Neill's, with the exception of two important
differences: Lirtzman only interviewed individuals who either already owned a
luxury watch or were �very likely� to purchase a watch in the next year,
whereas the Roper Report includes respondents who were �very likely� to
purchase a watch �in the near future� and persons who were �fairly likely� to
purchase such a luxury watch �in the next couple of years.� Further, Lirtzman
intercepted individuals while they were shopping not in shopping malls, but in
Tourneau Watch Company stores, two in Manhattan and one in the Roosevelt Field
Mall on Long Island, NY, one in Costa Mesa, CA, and one in Century City in Los
Angeles, CA. Tourneau is an authorized dealer of Cartier watches. In light of
this relationship, the Tourneau stores feature prominent posters of Cartier
watches as well as display cases with Cartier watches. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Lirtzman study also included a few less significant
alterations from O'Neill's study. Lirtzman asked if the participants associated
the watch's design with a particular source, as opposed to asking about whether
the participant associated the �design or style� with a particular source.
Because it is irrelevant to establishing secondary meaning, Lirtzman also did
not ask O'Neill's second question as to whether the participant could identify
which company she or he associated with the watch's design. The Lirtzman study
was also limited to the Tank Francaise and the Panthere because these watches
were the least recognized according to the Roper Report. Lirtzman showed
participants pictures of the Tag Heuer and Movado watches, like the Roper
Report, achieving the same percentages for recognition of these watches among
participants, but excluded the other controls. Finally, the photographs shown
to survey participants in Lirtzman's study are increasingly clear and more
uniform than those shown to participants in the Roper study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The results of Lirtzman's study are as follows: 61%
of the survey respondents associated the Tank Francaise's design with a
particular source and 63% of the survey respondents associated the Panthere
with a particular source. Lirtzman concludes from this result and the Atlanta
results in the Roper Report that surveying individuals who either own or are
very likely to purchase a luxury watch establishes consumer recognition of the
Cartier watch families at issue in the range of 50 to 60%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants' principal objection to Lirtzman's
report is that in light of the Cartier posters at Tourneau and the fact that
its watches are among those displayed in Tourneau's cases, the result of the
study are biased. The court, however, disagrees. There are a panoply of luxury
watches prominently featured at Tourneau, both in the display cases and on the
walls as posters and murals; Tourneau changes its displays every few months;
and there are 110 brands sold at Tourneau, all of which have multiple lines or
models within them. The Cartier case, for example, contains six to a dozen
watch models, including the watches at issue. As such, while Cartier is sold at
Tourneau and is displayed among the many images a consumer perceives while
shopping there, the likelihood that a survey participant's reaction to the Tank
Francaise and Panthere would have been so influenced is so minimal as to have
little to no effect on the probative value of Lirtzman's report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, the court credits the testimony of Dr.
Lirtzman that valid market research does not require a secondary meaning survey
to be conducted in a vacuum given the nature of the questions posed to the
survey participants. At Tourneau, consumers were asked questions in an
environment in which one would actually purchase a luxury timepiece. Images of
the products to be sold are customary in such an environment. Had the Lirtzman's
pollsters asked about particular brands of the watches shown to participants
surrounded by promotional images, this would raise the specter of potential
bias; but here, where the question was simply whether a participant associated
the watch with a particular company, without asking which one, no such concern
arises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, in light of a) the results obtained by
defendants' expert in Atlanta, where the survey was undoubtedly taken in a mall
where higher-end merchandise is sold, meaning, an environment more consistent
with Cartier's consumer population, and where the respondents were increasingly
likely to either own or purchase a luxury time piece in the immediate future;
b) plaintiffs' survey showing that the Atlanta results are more likely to be
accurate than those obtained in other fora; and c) the Court's concerns about
the absence of persons within the age group 18&#8211;34 or mistakes in
tabulating their survey results in the Roper Report, the court adopts the
testimony of Dr. Sidney Lirtzman, finding that the results obtained in Atlanta
and in the Lirtzman Report are representative of the secondary meaning of the
watches at issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>REAVLEY, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The parties correctly agree that a color scheme can
be protected as a trademark when it has acquired secondary meaning and is
non-functional. <i>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co.<a href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[15]</span></b></span></span></a> </i>Although the parties
discuss color at length in their briefs, the Universities do not claim that
every instance in which their team colors appear violates their respective
trademarks. Instead, the claimed trademark is in the colors on merchandise that
combines other identifying indicia referring to the Universities. It is
appropriate therefore to consider not only the color but also the entire
context in which the color and other indicia are presented on the t-shirts at
issue here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smack contends that the claimed marks are too broad
to encompass a trademark because the concept of color along with other
identifying indicia is not distinctive. We disagree. As noted, the statute
contemplates that a trademark may include any word, name, or symbol �<i>or any
combination thereof.</i>�<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[16]</span></span></span></a>
The Supreme Court has recognized that the Lanham Act describes the universe of
permissible marks �in the broadest of terms.�<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[17]</span></span></span></a>
Because the Court recognizes that trademarks may include color, we see no
reason to exclude color plus other identifying indicia from the realm of
protectible marks provided the remaining requirements for protection are met.
Thus, the first step here is to ask whether the Universities' claimed marks
have acquired secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Secondary meaning �occurs when, �in the minds of
the public, the primary significance of a [mark] is to identify the source of
the product rather than the product itself.� � <i>Wal&#8211;Mart Stores, Inc.
v. Samara Bros., Inc.</i><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[18]</span></span></span></span></a>
The inquiry is one of the public's mental association between the mark and the
alleged mark holder. <i>Sno&#8211;Wizard Mfg., Inc. v. Eisemann Prods. Co.</i><a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[19]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>A mark has acquired
secondary meaning when it �has come through use to be uniquely associated with
a specific source.� <i>Pebble Beach Co. v. Tour 18 I Ltd.</i><a href="#_ftn20"
name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[20]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>We have applied a
multi-factor test for determining secondary meaning. The factors include: �(1)
length and manner of use of the mark or trade dress, (2) volume of sales, (3)
amount and manner of advertising, (4) nature of use of the mark or trade dress
in newspapers and magazines, (5) consumer-survey evidence, (6) direct consumer
testimony, and (7) the defendant's intent in copying the trade dress.�<a
href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[21]</span></span></span></a> These factors in combination
may show that consumers consider a mark to be an indicator of source even if
each factor alone would not prove secondary meaning.<a href="#_ftn22"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no dispute in this case that for a
significant period of time the Universities have been using their color schemes
along with other indicia to identify and distinguish themselves from others.
Smack admits in its brief that the Universities' colors are well known among
fans �as a shorthand nonverbal visual means of identifying the universities.� But
according to Smack, the longstanding use of the school colors to adorn licensed
products is not the same as public recognition that the school colors identify
the Universities as a unique source of goods. We think, however, that the
factors for determining secondary meaning and an examination of the context in
which the school colors are used and presented in this case support the
conclusion that the secondary meaning of the marks is inescapable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The record shows that the Universities have been
using their color combinations since the late 1800s.<a href="#_ftn23"
name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[23]</span></span></span></a> The color schemes appear on
all manner of materials, including brochures, media guides, and alumni
materials associated with the Universities. Significantly, each university
features the color schemes on merchandise, especially apparel connected with
school sports teams, and such prominent display supports a finding of secondary
meaning.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[24]</span></span></span></a>
The record also shows that sales of licensed products combining the color
schemes with other references to the Universities annually exceed the tens of
millions of dollars.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[25]</span></span></span></a>
As for advertising, the district court held that the Universities �advertise
items with their school colors in almost every conceivable manner ....�<sup>F<a
href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[26]</span></span></span></a></sup> It is not clear from
the summary judgment evidence where and how the Universities advertise their
merchandise, but they certainly do use their color schemes and indicia in
numerous promotional materials aimed at students, faculty, alumni, and the
public in general, which strengthens the conclusion that the color schemes and
indicia viewed in context of wearing apparel also serves as an indicator of the
Universities as the source or sponsor of the apparel. Furthermore, the district
court correctly observed that the school color schemes have been referenced
multiple times in newspapers and magazines and that the schools also frequently
refer to themselves using the colors.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[27]</span></span></span></a>
The district court did not specifically refer to any consumer-survey evidence
or direct consumer testimony, but it noted that Smack admitted it had
incorporated the Universities' color schemes into its shirts to refer to the
Universities and call them to the mind of the consumer. Thus, Smack itself
believed that the Universities' color schemes had secondary meaning that could
influence consumers, which further supports the conclusion that there is
secondary meaning here.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[28]</span></span></span></a>
Given the longstanding use of the color scheme marks and their prominent
display on merchandise, in addition to the well-known nature of the colors as
shorthand for the schools themselves and Smack's intentional use of the colors
and other references, there is no genuine issue of fact that when viewed in the
context of t-shirts or other apparel, the marks at issue here have acquired the
secondary meaning of identifying the Universities in the minds of consumers as
the source or sponsor of the products rather than identifying the products
themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We think this conclusion is consistent with the
importance generally placed on sports team logos and colors by the public. We
have previously noted, although not in the context of secondary meaning, that
team emblems and symbols are sold because they serve to identify particular
teams, organizations, or entities with which people wish to identify. <i>See
Boston Prof'l Hockey Ass'n v. Dallas Cap &amp; Emblem Mfg., Inc.<a
href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[29]</span></b></span></span></a></i> We think this desire
by consumers to associate with a particular university supports the conclusion
that team colors and logos are, in the minds of the fans and other consumers,
source indicators of team-related apparel. By associating the color and other
indicia with the university, the fans perceive the university as the source or
sponsor of the goods because they want to associate with that source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smack argues that because photographs of businesses
near the campuses of the Universities show use of school colors by those
businesses, consumers in college towns merely associate school colors with
�support of the home team.� Smack cites no authority or supporting evidence for
its contention, however. Moreover, the fact that other businesses in college
towns may use the same colors as a local university does not create an issue of
fact as to the secondary meaning of the colors used in merchandise that the
Universities indisputably produce, especially given Smack's admission of
intentional use of the colors to influence consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smack also argues that because the Universities
grant licenses to many licensees, a consumer may not identify a university as
the <i>single</i> source of the product. The fact that the Universities may
grant licenses to many licensees to sell authorized products does not negate
the fact that the schools are still the sources of the marks.<a href="#_ftn30"
name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[30]</span></span></span></a> We conclude that the record
establishes secondary meaning in the marks here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Necessary</i> <i>proportion
of relevant consumer population perceiving secondary meaning</i>.&nbsp; Courts
generally require that a �substantial� proportion of the relevant consumer
population perceive the descriptive mark as a designation of source for that
mark to qualify for protection.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g., Coach Leatherware Co. v.
AnnTaylor, Inc</i>., 933 F.2d 162, 168 (2d Cir. 1991) (�The plaintiff is not
required to establish that <i>all</i> consumers relate the product to its
producer; it need only show that a substantial segment of the relevant consumer
group makes this connection.�).&nbsp; But what proportion is substantial?&nbsp;
If survey evidence is presented, courts have generally been satisfied, as in
the <i>Cartier</i> case above, with a proportion at or above 50%.&nbsp; <i>See,
e.g., Harlequin Enterprises, Ltd. v. Gulf &amp; Western Corp</i>., 644 F.2d 946
(2d Cir. 1981) (finding 50% association to be probative of secondary meaning in
book cover design); <i>Spraying Systems Co. v. Delavan</i>, 975 F.2d 387, 394
(7th Cir. 1992) (�While a 50-percent figure is regarded as clearly sufficient
to establish secondary meaning, a figure in the thirties can only be considered
marginal.�); Boston Beer Co. Ltd. Partnership v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9
F.3d 175, 183 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993). (characterizing a 36% showing of association
as �hardly overwhelming�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More generally, courts may require more compelling evidence
of secondary meaning for marks that are highly descriptive.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> � 15:28 (�[A]s a general rule
of thumb, the more descriptive the term, the greater the evidentiary burden to
establish secondary meaning. That is, the less distinctive the term, the
greater the quantity and quality of evidence of secondary meaning needed to
prove the requisite degree of distinctiveness.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The statutory
mechanism for registration of descriptive marks with secondary meaning</i>. Lanham
Act �� 2(e) &amp; 2(f), 15 U.S.C. �� 1052(e) &amp; (f), provide for the
registration of descriptive marks with secondary meaning.&nbsp; The relevant
portions of � 2 read as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>No trademark by which the goods of
the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused
registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it� </p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(e) Consists of a mark which (1)
when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is merely
descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(f) Except as expressly excluded
in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(3), and (e)(5) of this section, nothing
in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant
which has become distinctive of the applicant�s goods in commerce.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. �1052.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The �primary
significance� of a mark as a designation of source</i>.&nbsp; In a footnote in <i>Inwood
Labs, Inc. v. Ives Labs, Inc</i>., 56 U.S. 844, 851 n.11 (1982), the Supreme
Court complicated things considerably when it explained: �To establish
secondary meaning, a manufacturer must show that, in the minds of the public,
the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source
of the product rather than the product itself.�&nbsp; What does this
mean?&nbsp; That to qualify for protection, the �primary significance� of a
descriptive term must be its �secondary meaning� as a designation or
source?&nbsp; Must courts find that the descriptive term signifies source to a
greater degree than it describes the product?&nbsp; <i>Cf.</i> <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Gilson</span> �2.09[2] (�To establish secondary
meaning in an inherently nondistinctive term, the plaintiff must show that the
primary significance of the term in the public mind is not the product but its
producer.�).&nbsp; Note the subtly different wording of Judge Easterbrook�s
approach to the matter in <i>Bretford Mfg., Inc. v. Smith Sys. Mfg. Corp</i>.,
419 F.3d 576 (7th Cir. 2005), where he explained that secondary meaning (in
this case, for product design) occurs when �consumers understand the design
elements to signify the goods� <i>origin</i> and not just its attributes.�&nbsp;
<i>Id</i>. at 579 (emphasis in original).&nbsp; The phrase �and not just its
attributes� arguably rejects, as nearly all courts do, any kind of strict
�primary significance� test in the descriptiveness context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trademarks may be deemed generic either (1) because they are
born generic, <i>see, e.g</i>., <i>Schwan's IP, LLC v. Kraft Pizza Co</i>., 460
F.3d 971, 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1790 (8th Cir. 2006) (finding <span style='font-variant:

(TTAB 2000) (finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>e-ticket</span> for electronic
ticketing services to be generic); Nat'l Conf. of Bar Examiners v. Multistate
Legal Studies, Inc., 692 F.2d 478, 487 (7th Cir.1982) (finding <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>multistate bar examination</span> for legal
testing services to be generic), or (2) because they lose their source
distinctiveness through a process of �genericide,� <i>see, e.g</i>., <i>Haughton
Elevator Co. v. Seeberger</i>, 85 U.S.P.Q. 80 (Comm'r Pat. 1950) (cancelling
registration of <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>escalator</span> mark for
moving staircases); <i>Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co</i>., 272 F. 505, 510
(D.N.Y. 1921) (finding as to the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>aspirin</span>
for acetyl salicylic acid that �[a]mong consumers generally the name has gone
into the public domain�); King-Seeley Themos Co. v. Aladdin Indus. Inc., 321
F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1963) (finding �thermos� with a lower-case �t� for
vacuum-insulated containers bottles to be generic, but �Themos� with an
upper-case �T� to be a valid trademark).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a variety of simple rules of thumb that inform
courts� determination of whether a mark is generic or descriptive.&nbsp; <i>Abercrombie</i>
outlined a genus/species distinction: �A generic term is one that refers, or
has come to be understood as referring, to the genus of which the particular
product is a species.� <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc</i>.,
537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976).&nbsp; There is also the �who-are-you/what-are-you�
distinction:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In determining whether a term is generic, we have often
relied upon the �who-are-you/what-are-you� test: �A mark answers the buyer's
questions �Who are you?� �Where do you come from?� �Who vouches for you?� But
the [generic] name of the product answers the question �What are you?� � <i>Official
Airline Guides, Inc. v. Goss</i>, 6 F.3d 1385, 1391 (9th Cir.1993) (quoting 1
J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i> � 12.01 (3d
ed.1992)). Under this test, �[i]f the primary significance of the trademark is
to describe the <i>type of product</i> rather than the <i>producer</i>, the
trademark [is] a generic term and [cannot be] a valid trademark.� <i>Anti&#8211;Monopoly,
Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group</i>, 611 F.2d 296, 304 (9th Cir.1979) (emphases
added)</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Filipino Yellow Pages, Inc. v. Asian Journal
Publications, Inc</i>., 198 F.3d 1143, 1147 (9th Cir. 1999).&nbsp; Courts will
also rely on the proposition that a mark is generic if it is the �common
descriptive name� of the good or service to which it is affixed.&nbsp; <i>See,
e.g</i>., <i>San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S. Olympic Committee</i>,
483 U.S. 522, 532 n. 7 (1987) (�A common descriptive name of a product or
service is generic. Because a generic name by definition does not <i>distinguish</i>
the identity of a particular product, it cannot be registered as a trademark
under the Lanham Act.� (emphasis in original)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But while the basic principles underlying the genericness
analysis are straightforward, distinguishing between a highly descriptive and
generic mark can be exceedingly difficult in close cases, and the stakes in
such cases can be exceedingly high.&nbsp; Recall that even a �highly
descriptive� mark will qualify for protection upon a showing of secondary
meaning.&nbsp; A generic mark, by contrast, is unredeemable; it will never
receive protection under any circumstances.&nbsp; Genericness doctrine,
meanwhile, can be quite malleable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following opinion, <i>Pilates, Inc. v. Current Concepts,
Inc</i>., 120 F.Supp.2d 286 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), is detailed and lengthy. &nbsp;It
is the result of an especially hard-fought genericism battle in front of an
experienced trademark judge willing to take the time in her opinion to attend
closely to the evidence presented.&nbsp; As you read through the <i>Pilates</i>
opinion, consider the following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>As for the genus/species distinction, how does one establish the
appropriate level of abstraction at which one defines the genus, the species,
and even the subspecies?&nbsp; What prevents a plaintiff from claiming that the
genus is, for example, beer, and the plaintiff merely wants rights in one name
of a species of beer, which is �light beer�?&nbsp; <i>See</i>&nbsp; <i>Miller
Brewing Co. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co</i>., 561 F.2d 75 (7th Cir. 1977)
(finding <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>light</span> and <span

style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How are the factors that the <i>Pilates</i> court uses to

courts typically use to distinguish descriptive from suggestive marks?</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1880. Starting in or around 1914, when Mr. Pilates was interned in England with
other German nationals during World War I, he developed a method of
conditioning incorporating specific exercises designed to strengthen the entire
body, with emphasis on the lower back and abdominal region, while at the same
time enhancing flexibility. Mr. Pilates developed numerous pieces of equipment
for use in connection with his method of conditioning. Most of these pieces of
equipment utilize springs to provide some form of resistance against which the
person performing the exercises can work. The most prominent among these pieces
of equipment are the �reformer,� the �Cadillac� (also known as a �trap table�),
the �Wunda Chair,� and various �barrels,� one of which is referred to as a
�spine corrector.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the mid&#8211;1920s, Mr. Pilates and his wife,
Clara, emigrated to the United States. They moved into an apartment at 939
Eighth Avenue in New York City and opened an adjoining studio at which they
provided training in the method of exercise Mr. Pilates had developed. During
Mr. Pilates' lifetime, his method of conditioning, which he sometimes called
�contrology,� gained a positive reputation in the New York City dance community�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1941, Romana Kryzanowska, then a dancer in
George Balanchine's dance company, was referred to Mr. and Mrs. Pilates for
rehabilitation of an ankle injury. At that time, the studio had a glass door
which read, in black ink, �Contrology&#8212;Art of Control&#8212;Pilates
Studio&#8212;Joseph Pilates,� with each of these four terms on descending
levels. Kryzanowska trained and studied with Mr. and Mrs. Pilates until 1944,
when she married and moved to Peru. Kryzanowska lived in Peru until 1959�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Pilates promoted his
method of exercise and attempted to increase its use by the public. For
example, as Kryzanowska related, �[Mr. Pilates] wanted all colleges mainly to
have this exercise program because he thoroughly believed in it and thought it
would be good for the human race and even children in schools.� Mr. and Mrs.
Pilates never did anything to prevent others from using their name to describe
what they taught�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span

U.S. Registration No. 1,405,304, was registered by Aris Isotoner Gloves, Inc.
on August 12, 1986 for �exercise instruction services� (the �PILATES service
mark�). PILATES, Registration No. 1,907,447, was registered by plaintiff on
July 25, 1995 for �exercise equipment, namely reformers, exercise chairs,
trapeze tables, resistance exercise units and spring actuated exercise units�
(the �PILATES equipment mark�)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[From 1967 to 1984, the Pilates studio was operated by
various individuals and companies].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span

were sold to Aris Isotoner Gloves, Inc. (�Aris Isotoner�). Aris Isotoner's
then-president and CEO, Lari Stanton, was a student of Kryzanowska's who wanted
the studio to survive despite its financial difficulties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[Aris Isotoner bought all of the studios assets including

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. Evidence of Genericness</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. Dictionary Definitions</p>

style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span

reflect the general public's perception of a mark's meaning and are thus
helpful in determining whether a term is generic. <i>Murphy Door Bed Co. v.
Interior Sleep Sys., Inc.,</i> 874 F.2d 95, 101 (2d Cir.1989).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Random House Webster's College Dictionary</i>
defines �Pilates� as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Pilates (pi l�' tez). <i>Trademark.</i> a system of
physical conditioning involving low-impact exercises and stretches, performed
on special equipment. Also called <i>Pila'tes meth'od.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff [<i>sic</i>?] objects to this definition
on the ground that the definition indicates that Pilates is a trademark.
However, as the dictionary's editors explain, an acknowledgment that a term may
be trademarked does not show that the term's primary significance is to
indicate a source of a product or service:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A number of entered words which we have reason to believe
constitute trademarks have been designated as such. However, no attempt has
been made to designate as trademarks or service marks all words or terms in
which proprietary rights might exist. The inclusion, exclusion or definition of
a word or term is not intended to affect, or to express a judgment on, the
validity or legal status of the word or term as a trademark, service mark, or
other proprietary term.</p>

term Pilates on the dust jacket in a listing of new words, along with words
like �FAQ,� �road rage,� �smoothie,� and �index fund.� The dictionary's
publishers explain why these new words were added:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The sources of new words and meanings are manifold. They
include news items and articles in newspapers and magazines, books and
CD&#8211;ROMS, plays and movies, television and radio, and the texts of
electronic databases like NEXIS and LEXIS.... Editors periodically review the citations
and select from them those items that show sufficient currency and importance
to be recorded in the dictionary.... Physical fitness and body building are
movements that since the 1960s have enlisted the enthusiasm of millions,
producing a host of new words, including aerobics, dancercize, jazzercise,
Exercycle, Pilates, step aerobics, abs, delts, lats, and glutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span

identifies Pilates as a method of exercise. Accordingly, this factor weighs in
favor of genericness.</p>

name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*298"></a>of genericness. Generic use
by competitors which the trademark holder has not challenged strongly supports
a finding of genericness. However, the lack of use of the mark by other
suppliers of the same product or service does not weigh against genericness
where the holder of the registered mark polices it in such a manner as to deter
others from using the term in describing their products or services. <i>Murphy
Door Bed,</i> 874 F.2d at 101 n. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Romana Kryzanowska identified at least two dozen
individuals who use, or have used, the term Pilates to describe their services.
Kryzanowska explained that these people were trained in the Pilates method,
then �scattered� around the United States and not only called what they taught
Pilates but trained new instructors who themselves called what they taught
�Pilates.� Ron Fletcher, another former student of Mr. Pilates, also identified
a number of individuals who described what they taught as �Pilates.� He explained
that over the years he met with other Pilates practitioners and visited other
facilities where the exercises were taught, and that the exercises and method
in general were referred to as �Pilates.� Ron Fletcher also sold equipment with
plaques attached containing the name �Pilates.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kathy Grant, another former student of Mr. Pilates,
has taught Pilates since the 1960s and has used no other name to describe what
she teaches. She has taught Pilates to hundreds of NYU students and has always
identified what she taught to them as �Pilates.� She has also trained Pilates
teachers who have gone on to call what they taught �Pilates.� Grant has never
paid a licensing fee to use the word Pilates in connection with her teaching.
Nor has she ever sought authorization for calling her courses �Pilates.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Amy Taylor studied with and was certified by
Kryzanowska. When she later moved to Boulder, Colorado to open her own studio,
she was aware of approximately twelve teachers in the area who called what they
taught �Pilates.� Since 1990, Taylor has run the Pilates Center in Boulder,
offering Pilates training and teacher certification. Taylor identified at least
ten other individuals or organizations that certify teachers in the Pilates
method. The Pilates Center alone has certified approximately 110 people. Taylor
is aware of at least five manufacturers of Pilates equipment in addition to
Current Concepts.</p>

credibly identified numerous individuals and businesses that teach Pilates,

�Pilates.� All of these witnesses together have trained hundreds of individuals
in the Pilates method.</p>

style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff
makes two responses to this evidence. First, plaintiff points out that some of
the witnesses identified above have either been sued or sent cease and desist
letters by plaintiff. However, witnesses such as Kathy Grant and Donald Gratz
have not been challenged by plaintiff despite prominent use of the Pilates name
over many years. Moreover, witnesses identified many other businesses and
individuals offering Pilates services and equipment, and plaintiff provides no
evidence that it has challenged all or even most of them. Accordingly, this
objection only slightly reduces the weight of this evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, plaintiff argues that these witnesses
showed that there are many other names to describe body conditioning exercise
instruction services that are similar to but distinct from PILATES, such as the
Ron Fletcher Work, IMAX, Spiralfitness, Core Dynamics, Corfitness, The
Well&#8211;Tempered Workout, Body Moves, and Universal Reformer Technique.
However, <a name="sp_4637_299"></a><a name="SDU_299"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*299"></a>this does not undercut the
credible and voluminous testimony that there is no other way that is commonly
understood to describe Pilates exercises. Moreover, the evidence shows that
many of these alternative names were developed in response to threats of
litigation, which does not weigh against genericness. <i>See</i> <i>Murphy Door
Bed,</i> 874 F.2d at 101 n. 2. This objection has little impact on the strength
of this evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, the use of the word Pilates by
competitors and other persons in the trade weighs strongly in favor of
genericness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. Plaintiff's Use</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_______#HN;F7"></a><a name=B72000578796></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A plaintiff's own generic use of its marks supports
a finding of genericness, as does generic use by plaintiff's claimed
predecessors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no evidence that Mr. Pilates intended to
prevent the use of his name in connection with services and equipment relating
to his method of exercise. John Steel, the Pilates' friend and lawyer,
testified that Mr. and Mrs. Pilates never tried to restrict the use of their
name by others. Kryzanowska, plaintiff's principal witness, agreed that Mr.
Pilates wanted �the Pilates method everywhere to be for the world so that
everyone could benefit from it.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Kryzanowska operated the Pilates Studio during the
1970s and early 1980s and has been responsible for plaintiff's certification
program since Gallagher purchased the Pilates marks. When asked �what do you do
for a living?� at the beginning of her testimony, she replied, �I teach
Pilates.� Kryzanowska also agreed that some dance warmup exercises are
sometimes called �the Pilates,� �the way table tennis is called ping pong.�
When asked, �[w]hen people talk about Pilates, whether they do it as well as
you or not as well as you, they're not talking about you, they're talking about
this method of exercise, correct?� Kryzanowska replied, �I hope so.� Finally,
while Kryzanowska was in charge of the Pilates Studio, she assisted in the
writing of a book called <i>The Pilates Method of Physical and Mental
Conditioning</i> and �dictated large portions� to the book's authors.
Kryzanowska agrees that Pilates is a method of exercise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_12"><a name="sp_999_12"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Sean Gallagher used the term Pilates in a generic
manner when he briefly owned the marks personally. In a letter dated April 5,
1993 inviting �Pilates Instructor[s]� to join The Pilates Guild, Gallagher used
the word Pilates to identify a method of exercise:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The Pilates Studio is also determined, for lack of a better
phrase, to make Pilates a �household� word. As you know, The Pilates Exercise
System has been a virtual exercise secret for over seventy years. Outside of
New York and Los Angeles, even exercise enthusiasts have little or no knowledge
of the system. It is only thanks to the enduring quality of Pilates exercise
and the persistent and committed efforts of Pilates instructors in these and other
cities that Pilates hasn't disappeared altogether!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, plaintiff Pilates, Inc. has used PILATES in a
generic manner on a number of occasions. For example, in an undated memorandum
to all certified teachers by Elyssa Rosenberg, Associate Director of The
Pilates Studio, plaintiff advises that �a change has been made to make The
Method less generic in its description to the public and within the community.�
The change requires instructors to stop referring to �The Pilates<a
name="sp_4637_300"></a><a name="SDU_300"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*300"></a> Method� and instead call
it �The Pilates Method of Body Conditioning,� and to refer to �the method� as
�The Method.� Moreover, plaintiff's lawyers frequently used Pilates in a
generic sense during the course of the trial.<a name=FN13></a><a

style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff argues that this evidence is irrelevant
because it currently polices its marks vigorously and none of the uses
described were made in connection with prospective purchasers of instruction
services or exercise equipment. But when �the mark has �entered the public
domain beyond recall,� policing is of no consequence to a resolution of whether
a mark is generic.� <i>Murphy Door Bed,</i> 874 F.2d at 101 (quoting <i>King&#8211;Seeley
Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Indus.,</i> 321 F.2d 577, 579 (2d Cir.1963)). The
evidence described above shows that plaintiff and its predecessors, starting
with Mr. Pilates himself, have used the word Pilates in a generic sense to
describe a method of exercise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of
genericness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>4. Media Usage</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>a. Newspapers and Magazines</p>

style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span

sense is strong evidence of genericness. <i>Harley&#8211;Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli,</i>
164 F.3d 806, 811 (2d Cir.1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants submitted 775 articles dated after 1982
which use the word Pilates in some manner. Defendants divide these articles
into four categories: (1) those which mention only plaintiff or its
predecessors as the source of Pilates instruction, facilities, or equipment;
(2) those which mention both plaintiff or its predecessors and others as
sources for Pilates instruction, facilities, or equipment; (3) those which
mention only others and not plaintiff or its predecessors as sources for
Pilates instruction, facilities, or equipment; and (4) those which do not
mention any source for Pilates instruction, facilities, or equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_13"><a name="sp_999_13"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Of these 775 articles, defendants claim that only
83(11%) mention plaintiff or its predecessors alone; 60(8%) mention both
plaintiff or its predecessors and others; 165(21%) do not mention any source;
and 467(60%) mention only other sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff raises a number of objections to these
articles. First, plaintiff argues that defendants' classification system is
flawed because it only seeks to establish that sources other than plaintiff are
identified with Pilates. Plaintiff argues that this is irrelevant because �[a]
trademark need not identify source directly or explicitly.� <i>A.J. Canfield
Co. v. Honickman,</i> 808 F.2d 291, 300 (3d Cir.1986). Plaintiff contends that
because defendants admit that their third category �may include� some of
plaintiff's licensees, the articles cannot show that the Pilates marks are
generic because 610 of the 775 articles indicate some source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This objection carries little weight. It is correct
that �a term may function as an indicator of source and therefore as a valid
trademark, even though consumers may not know the name of the manufacturer or
producer of the product.� <i>Id.</i> However, this principle is inapplicable to
defendants' collection of articles, for two reasons. First, most of the
articles use the word Pilates to describe a method of exercise&#8212;a use
which plaintiff concedes is generic&#8212;in addition to identifying sources of
Pilates services and equipment. Second, plaintiff has not shown that the
articles imply that there exists a single �anonymous source� of Pilates
services and equipment. Plaintiff's assertion that the 467 articles which
mention only other sources of Pilates services and equipment include its
licensees is unsupported by any evidence. Plaintiff's argument, in essence, is
that because 610 of the 775 articles indicate some source of <a
name="sp_4637_301"></a><a name="SDU_301"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*301"></a>Pilates services and
equipment, the Pilates marks are not generic. However, plaintiff has not shown,
and cannot show, that the articles use the word Pilates to indicate a <i>single</i>
source of services and equipment. The fact that 610 articles refer to a wide
variety of sources is evidence that the term Pilates is generic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants submitted videotapes of various
television broadcasts in which the word Pilates was used in a generic manner.
Although some of the broadcasts are undated, most were aired between February
1995 and July 1997. The broadcasts include local and national news shows, such
as the CBS Morning News, and national entertainment-oriented shows, such as
�Hard Copy,� �Entertainment Tonight,� �Regis &amp; Kathie Lee,� and the game
show �Greed.� These broadcasts use �Pilates� to refer to a method of exercise
and not to identify a source of services or equipment. Accordingly, this
evidence weighs strongly in favor of genericness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_15"><a name="sp_999_15"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants also submitted evidence of the use of
the word �Pilates� on Internet web sites. Frank A. Cona, who operates a
business specializing in searching, monitoring, and documenting intellectual
property on the Internet, reviewed 318 web pages and concluded that 89% used
the term Pilates to refer to a form of exercise and not a source of services or
equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While many of the web sites Cona identified do show
generic use, Cona's numbers are questionable. First, Cona admitted that some of
the sites he reviewed were outside the United States. Second, he admitted
making numerous errors in his categorization of the web pages he reviewed.
Accordingly, the evidence of Internet use of the word Pilates adds little to
defendants' other evidence of newspaper, magazine, and television use of the
term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Overall, media use provides powerful evidence in
favor of genericness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>5. Survey Evidence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Consumer surveys are routinely admitted in
trademark cases to show genericness of a mark. <i>Schering Corp. v. Pfizer,
Inc.,</i> 189 F.3d 218, 225 (2d Cir.1999); <i>Nestle Co. v. Chester's Mkt.,
Inc.,</i> 571 F.Supp. 763, 769 (D.Conn.1983). Each side submitted a survey in
this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants retained Dr. Michael Rappeport to
conduct a survey to test whether the name Pilates is perceived as the name of a
type of product or service or the name of a source. Rappeport's survey first
screened respondents who were unfamiliar with the term Pilates; 200 of the 273
people surveyed answered that they were familiar with the word. The questions
of principal significance were �Other than the word Pilates, is there some kind
of word or short phrase that you use to refer to this type of exercise, or is
Pilates the only word you use?� and the follow-up �Is Pilates the only word
you've heard other people use?� The survey also asked, �Generally, in your own
words, how would you describe Pilates?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Of the 200 who were familiar with the word, no one
provided a substitute word for Pilates. One-hundred-seventy-seven people
responded that Pilates is the only word they use to describe the type of
exercise. One-hundred-sixty-seven people responded that Pilates is the only
word they hear others use to describe the type of exercise. The remainder
provided sentences including �stretching,� �mind and body,� and other similar
words and phrases. In response to the open-ended question �how would you
describe Pilates?�, everyone surveyed described Pilates as a type of exercise.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Rappeport's survey also included questions about
equipment. For example, respondents were asked �Are you aware of Pilates
equipment?� and the follow-up �As far as you know, is Pilates equipment
manufactured by: a) one company; b) several companies; c) or you don't know or
don't have an opinion.� 145 people had heard of Pilates equipment, and of
these, 25 answered �one company,� 41 answered �more than one company,� and 79
answered �don't know or don't have an opinion.� <a name="sp_4637_303"></a><a
name="SDU_303"></a><a name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*303"></a>Other
questions related to differences among exercises and types of equipment and are
not particularly helpful to a determination of genericness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_16"><a name="sp_999_16"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff objects to Rappeport's survey on a number
of grounds. First, plaintiff argues that the wrong universe was surveyed with
respect to the PILATES service mark. Rappeport chose as his universe a trade
association of health professionals called IDEA. Plaintiff argues that IDEA
members are not potential purchasers of exercise instruction services, but
rather are potential vendors of such services, and thus are not �potential
consumers of the product in question.� <i>Conopco, Inc. v. Cosmair, Inc.,</i>
49 F.Supp.2d 242, 253 (S.D.N.Y.1999). Plaintiff further argues that the wrong
universe was surveyed with respect to the PILATES equipment mark. Plaintiff
contends that the general public is the proper universe for Pilates equipment
because plaintiff, through its licensee Stamina Products, markets equipment to
the general public through mass market commercial channels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff's objections to Rappeport's survey
universe reduce the survey's usefulness to some extent. It is undisputed that
Pilates exercise instruction and equipment are increasingly being marketed to
the general public. An ideal survey universe would include all potential
purchasers of Pilates equipment or exercise instruction services, not just
professionals who are members of IDEA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, the IDEA universe was adequate for the
survey to have some weight in the genericness inquiry. First, plaintiff's own
expert, Edward Epstein, testified that he analyzed the adequacy of Rappeport's
survey universe and concluded that it was adequate. Indeed, Epstein used the
same universe in his own survey. Second, although it is undisputed that Pilates
instruction services and equipment are purchased by non-professionals in the
general public, it is also undisputed that fitness professionals purchase
Pilates equipment and receive training and certification in Pilates
instruction. Thus, the IDEA universe includes potential purchasers of both
Pilates equipment and Pilates services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff submits a survey by its own expert,
Edward Epstein, to rebut Rappeport's findings. In his survey, Epstein asked
respondents whether a number of purported �physical conditioning or fitness
methods,� including karate, yoga, �Crunch,� and Feldenkreis, �may be used and
promoted by trainers without having to obtain any company's authorization,
permission or certification.� Among those who were aware of each method, 17%
responded that Pilates may be used without authorization; 66% said the same
about karate; 74% said the same about yoga; 42% said the same about Crunch; and
17% said the same about Feldenkrais. Thus, Epstein concludes, the proportion of
respondents who consider Pilates generic is far less than 50%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Epstein also asked respondents who were familiar
with the piece of equipment called the reformer �May any company that makes the
Reformer put the Pilates name on the equipment or promote the fact that the
company makes the Pilates Reformer, or may only those companies that are
authorized to do so put the Pilates name on the equipment and promote the fact
that the company makes Pilates Reformer?� 86% replied that only those companies
that are authorized to do so may put the Pilates name on the equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_17"><a name="sp_999_17"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The main problem with Epstein's survey is that it
is based on a faulty premise. According to Epstein, his survey was designed:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>to ascertain the primary significance or meaning of Pilates
to the relevant universe or as Professor McCarthy puts it, what do buyers
understand by the word? Is it seen as a method of exercise and apparatus that
is available for anyone to use because it is a generic <a name="sp_4637_304"></a><a
name="SDU_304"></a><a name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*304"></a>type
of exercise or is it seen as someone's proprietary property that cannot be used
and promoted without obtaining authorization, permission or certification from
the company that owns the rights to it?</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>When asked on cross-examination �Can we agree that if
your premise is incorrect, that a method of exercise can be someone's
proprietary property, then your survey tested the wrong thing?� Epstein
replied, �I would say yes.� Since plaintiff concedes that a method of exercise
cannot be trademarked, it is clear by Epstein's own admission that his survey
is fundamentally flawed since it assumes that a method of exercise can be
someone's exclusive property. This is confirmed by the fact that 29% of those
surveyed responded that the generic term �karate� could not be used without
authorization and 25% said the same thing about the generic term �yoga.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>54</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Epstein's survey is also flawed with respect to the
equipment question. The question assumes the existence of �those companies that
are authorized to [use PILATES on equipment].� Just as the value of Rappeport's
question �what is Pilates� is reduced because the answer is suggested elsewhere
in the survey, so too is the value of Epstein's equipment question reduced
because the question itself suggests the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In sum, both surveys have serious flaws and neither is
particularly helpful in determining whether the Pilates marks are generic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>C. Assessment</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. The Primary Significance Of PILATES Is As A Method
Of Exercise, Not As A Source Of A Product Or Service</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_______#HN;F10"></a><a name=B102000578796></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> No one disputes that there exists a distinct method
of exercise based on the teachings of Joseph Pilates which people refer to as
the �Pilates method� or simply as �Pilates.� Nor is there any dispute that
equipment designed by Mr. Pilates is an integral component of the Pilates
method. The evidence described above shows that PILATES is understood by the
public to refer to either the Pilates method (as in �I do Pilates�) or to
products or services used in connection with the Pilates method (as in �Pilates
equipment� or �Pilates instruction�). In both uses of the word, the primary
significance of PILATES is as a method of exercise, not as a source of a
product or service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff nonetheless asserts that it may prevent
others from using the name PILATES to describe instruction services and
equipment. However, it is undisputed that plaintiff cannot prevent anyone from
doing or teaching the exercises developed by Joseph Pilates or from
manufacturing and selling equipment invented by Mr. Pilates (since the patents
on those inventions have long since expired). Plaintiff's argument thus rests
on the assumption that even if the word PILATES is understood by consumers as a
generic term for a particular method of exercise, the word may still be
appropriated to identify a particular source of services and equipment related
to that method of exercise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_18"><a name="sp_999_18"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>57</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This argument was soundly rejected in <i>American
Montessori Soc'y, Inc. v. Association Montessori Internationale,</i> 155
U.S.P.Q. 591 (TTAB 1967). In <i>Montessori,</i> the Trademark Trial and Appeal
Board held that the term MONTESSORI was generic as applied to a particular type
of education and the �philosophy and methods associated therewith.� <i>Id.</i>
at 592. Responding to an argument similar to plaintiff's, the Board explained
that �it necessarily follows that if the term �MONTESSORI� is generic and/or
descriptive as applied to the �MONTESSORI� teaching methods, it is equally so
as used in connection with toys, games, teaching aids, and other material
employed in connection with said methods.� <i>Id.</i> at 593.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>58</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case is strikingly similar. Since the word
PILATES is generic with respect to a particular method of exercise, it is
necessarily also generic with respect to equipment<a name="sp_4637_305"></a><a
name="SDU_305"></a><a name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*305"></a> and
services offered in connection with that method. The evidence shows that
consumers identify the word PILATES only with a particular method of exercise,
whether the word is used by itself or in connection with instruction services
or equipment for use in that method. Plaintiff cannot monopolize a method of
exercise by asserting trademarks in the generic word used to describe it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. PILATES Is A Genus, Not A Species</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>59</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �A generic term is one that refers, or has come to
be understood as referring, to the genus of which the particular product is the
species.� <i>Abercrombie,</i> 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir.1976). The underlying
assumption in plaintiff's position is that the relevant genus in this case is
�the realm of exercise methods emphasizing core movements� and that the species
is Pilates. (Pl. Letter of Jun. 19, 2000.) In plaintiff's view, other species
include brands like Balanced Body, the Ron Fletcher Work, Polestar, and Core
Dynamics. Under plaintiff's overgeneralized definition of the genus, any genus
could be transformed to a species. For example, yoga would be classified as a
species along with Pilates, even though yoga is a method of exercise that is
properly classified as a genus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>60</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff's method of classification does not
reflect the reality of what is actually taught under these names. With respect
to the PILATES service mark, there is ample evidence that the Pilates method
forms the basis for the Balanced Body Method, the Ron Fletcher Work, and other
exercise instruction services. Even though these methods of instruction may
differ in some respects from those used by plaintiff, all of them, including
plaintiff's, are united by the Pilates method of exercise. Accordingly, in a
proper system of classification, the Pilates method is the genus, and the
particular ways of teaching that method are the species. Under this approach, the
Ron Fletcher Work is a species of Pilates, as is the Balanced Body program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. No Word Other Than PILATES Can Adequately Describe
Products And Services Based On The Pilates Method</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>61</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A final factor in the genericness inquiry is the
availability of other means to describe the product or service at issue.<a
name=FN15></a><a name=F015152000578796></a><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[33]</span></span></span></a>
The Second Circuit explained the importance of this consideration in <i>Genesee
Brewing Co. v. Stroh Brewing Co.,</i> 124 F.3d 137 (2d Cir.1997):</p>

<p class=Blockquote><a name="SDU_19"><a name="sp_999_19">Trademark law seeks to
provide a producer neither with a monopoly over a functional characteristic it
has originated nor with a monopoly over a particularly effective marketing
phrase. Instead the law grants a monopoly over a phrase only if and to the
extent it is necessary to enable consumers to distinguish one producer's goods
from others and even then only if the grant of such a monopoly will not
substantially disadvantage competitors by preventing them from describing the
nature of their goods. Accordingly, if a term is necessary to describe a
product characteristic that a competitor has a right to copy, a producer may
not effectively preempt competition by claiming that term as its own. <i>Id.</i>
at 144. This rule is �based on long-standing and integral principles of
trademark law.� <i>Id.</i> at 145.</a></a></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>The evidence established that the word PILATES is
necessary to describe the exercises and teachings that comprise the Pilates
method. Although flawed in other respects, defendants' survey showed that
consumers of exercise instruction services and equipment generally do not use
any other term to describe the Pilates method. Numerous witnesses testified
that they did not use any other expression to describe <a name="sp_4637_306"></a><a
name="SDU_306"></a><a name="citeas((Cite_as:_120_F.Supp.2d_286,_*306"></a>the
Pilates method, nor could they even think of one. Efforts by plaintiff and its
lawyers to avoid using PILATES in a generic sense result only in cumbersome
expressions such as �exercises based on the teachings and methods of Joseph H.
Pilates.� Accordingly, this case falls squarely within the rule announced in <i>Genesee.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>62</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff offers two responses. First, plaintiff
points to numerous other terms that it contends are adequate substitutes to
identify the Pilates method of exercise. However, there was ample testimony by
the creators of many of these terms that they still use the word PILATES to
describe the nature of their products and services. Indeed, one of the
alternative terms plaintiff identifies is Balanced Body, which is defendants'
current brand name. However, defendants continue to use PILATES to describe
their equipment and services for lack of a better term to do so. Moreover, many
of the alternative terms identified by plaintiff (such as PhysicalMind) were
created in response to plaintiff's threats of litigation. Such use does not
weigh against genericness. <i>Murphy Door Bed,</i> 874 F.2d at 101 n. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>63</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, plaintiff argues that it objects only to
the use of PILATES in a trademark sense. However, plaintiff has never been able
to state a coherent distinction between acceptable and unacceptable uses of the
word. Moreover, such a distinction is inconsistent with plaintiff's policing of
the mark. For example, in a cease and desist letter sent to Anthony Rabara in
1993, Gallagher informed Rabara that �[s]hould you choose not to pay the
licensing fee, please understand that you will not be able to use the <i>Pilates</i>
(R) name in your advertising, or any promotional materials. <i>You won't be
able to call what you do Pilates.�</i> (emphasis added). Numerous other cease
and desist letters prohibit the use of PILATES �in any manner.� Accordingly,
protecting plaintiff's marks would �effectively preempt competition.� <i>Genesee,</i>
124 F.3d at 144</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_20"><a name="sp_999_20"><span style='color:
gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>64</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, although plaintiff has made substantial
efforts to police its marks and promote the Pilates method, it nonetheless
cannot foreclose others from using the word PILATES to describe their services
of which the equipment is an integral part. <i>See</i> <i>Abercrombie,</i> 537
F.2d at 10 (�[N]o matter how much money and effort the user of a generic term
has poured into promoting the sale of its merchandise and what success it has
achieved in securing public identification, it cannot deprive competing
manufacturers of the product of the right to call an article by its name.�)</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>D. Conclusion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>65</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For the foregoing reasons, defendants have proven
by clear and convincing evidence that the PILATES service mark and the PILATES
equipment mark are generic.</p>

USPQ2d at 1553. Because there are no restrictions or limitations to the
channels of trade or classes of consumers for pretzel crackers, the relevant
consuming public comprises ordinary consumers who purchase and eat pretzel
crackers.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>C. <u>Public perception</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To determine the public perception of the term
�PRETZEL CRISPS� as it applies to �pretzel crackers,� we first must decide how
to analyze the term. It is well settled that we may analyze the component parts
of a proposed mark as a step on the way to an ultimate determination that the
proposed mark as a whole is generic. <i>See 1800Mattress.com IP</i>, 586 F.3d
1359, 92 USPQ2d 1682, 1684 (explaining that the Board appropriately considered
the separate meanings of ��mattress� and �.com� when determining that the
combination �mattress.com� was generic); <i>In re Hotels.com LP,</i> 573 F.3d
1300, 1304, 91 USPQ2d 1532, 1535 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (affirming the Board's
finding that �the composite term HOTELS.COM communicates no more than the
common meanings of the individual components�). Thus, in cases where the
proposed mark is a compound term (in other words a combination of two or more
terms in ordinary grammatical construction), genericness may be established
with evidence of the meaning of the constituent words, and where �the terms
remain as generic in the compound as individually, and the compound thus
created is itself generic.� <i>In re Gould Paper Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 1017, 5
USPQ2d 1110, 1112, (Fed. Cir. 1987); <i>accord In re American Fertility Soc'y</i>,
188 F.3d 1341, 1347, 51 USPQ2d 1832, 1836 (Fed. Cir. 1999). By contrast, �where
the proposed mark is a phrase (such as �Society for Reproductive Medicine�),
the board �cannot simply cite definitions and generic uses of the constituent
terms of a mark�; it must conduct an inquiry into �the meaning of the disputed
phrase as a whole.� <i>In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp.,</i> 240 F.3d
1341, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1810 (Fed. Cir. 2001), citing <i>Am. Fertility,</i> 188
F.3d at 1347, 51 USPQ2d at 1836; <i>see also In Re Country Music Ass'n, Inc.,</i>
100 USPQ2d 1824, 1828 (TTAB 2011).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff argues that �PRETZEL CRISPS� is a
compound term under the <i>Gould</i> standard, whereas defendant, citing to <i>Am.
Fertility,</i> argues that ��PRETZEL CRISPS� is a phrase, comprised of terms
that �had not previously been used in a unified fashion� and �did not exist in
the public lexicon prior to the launch of Snack Factory's PRETZEL CRISPS
crackers in 2004.� Thus, we must decide whether the term �PRETZEL CRISPS,� when
applied to �pretzel crackers,� is a unified term having a meaning beyond the
sum of its parts as argued by defendant, or rather maintains the meaning of its
constituent terms as argued by plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In analyzing the term, we find no additional
meaning added to �PRETZEL CRISPS� in relation to �pretzel crackers,� when the
individual terms are combined. As noted, compound words that do not add new
meaning may be analyzed by their constituent terms. <i>See 1800Mattress.com,</i>
92 USPQ2d at 1684, <i>citing Am. Fertility</i>, 51 USPQ2d 1832 (�[I]f the
compound word would plainly have no different meaning from its constituent words,
and dictionaries, or other evidentiary sources, establish the meaning of those
words to be generic, then the compound word too has been proved generic. No
additional proof of the genericness of the compound word is required.�).
Indeed, the Federal Circuit in <i>American Fertility</i> specifically confirmed
<i>Gould</i>'s applicability to situations dealing with �compound terms formed
by the union of words,� which is the situation presented in this case. 51
USPQ2d at 1837. We therefore analyze the term as a compound term, using the
ordinary grammatical construction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no question that the term �pretzel� in
�PRETZEL CRISPS� refers to a type of pretzel, and therefore is generic for
pretzels and pretzel snacks, including �pretzel crackers.� We therefore discuss
the meaning and effect of the term �crisps.� Defendant agrees that there are
certain foods that may be ��crisps� but argues that crackers are not
appropriately identified as such. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the
term �crisp� has come to be known as one name for a �cracker,� and a �pretzel
crisp� is therefore a �pretzel cracker.� In undertaking our analysis, we keep
in mind that while we look to the �primary significance� of the term, what
matters is the mark in relation to the identified goods, and we note that all
possible generic names for a product must reside in the public domain. <i>See</i>
J Thomas McCarthy, 2 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition</span> � 12:9 (4th ed. 2013). (�Any product
may have many generic designations. Any one of those is incapable of trademark
significance.�); <i>see also 1800Mattress</i>, 92 USPQ2d at 1685 (�[A]ny term

<p class=Blockquote>In designing a TEFLON-type survey, both the initial

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Alex Simonson, founder and President of
Simonson Assoc., Inc., was retained as an expert by counsel for plaintiff. He
conducted a survey between August 15 and September 3, 2011. The screening
criteria were defined as follows: �purchasers of salty snacks at supermarkets
or grocery stores within the past 6 months or likely purchasers of salty snacks
at supermarkets or grocery stores within the coming 6 months.� In a
��double-blind� survey, his interviewers conducted interviews, by phone, in the
following manner, of 250 survey participants:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>1. The interviewer read aloud to survey respondents
definitions of �category names� (generic names) and �brand names� and asked if
survey participants understood the definition of a common name and a brand
name. Only 2 respondents indicated they did not, and they were removed from the
survey. 248 then continued on. (Simonson report at 10).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>2. Participants who said they understood the difference
between a category name and brand name were then read a list of names
individually for food and some unrelated products and asked whether they
thought each name was a category name, a brand name, �don't know�, or �not
sure.� The list, with results, follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0in'><span><img
width=382 height=203 id="_x0000_i1042"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on these results, Dr. Simonson concluded in
his report: �The results indicate that PRETZEL CRISPS is not perceived by a
majority of relevant consumers as a brand name.� Defendant's expert, Dr. E.
Deborah Jay, was retained to rebut the conclusions of Dr. Simonson. She noted
several problems with his methodology including the following: 1) the universe
of survey participants was underinclusive, including only those who purchase
salty snacks at certain places; 2) there were two options of giving no opinion,
both �don't know� and �not sure,� which may have confused participants, and
caused some to choose one or the other incorrectly; and, perhaps most
importantly 3) Dr. Simonson did not conduct a mini-test to ascertain whether
survey participants understood the difference between brand and common (or
category) names, but rather he simply <i>asked</i> whether they did. Indeed, as
pointed out by Dr. Jay, only two survey participants indicated they did not, or
less than 1%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with Dr. Jay's criticisms of Dr.
Simonson's survey. With respect to Dr. Simonson's failure to administer an
initial mini-test, an analogous situation was at issue in the recently decided
case of <i>Sheetz of Delaware, Inc. v. Doctor's Assoc., Inc.,</i> 108 USPQ2d
1341, 1360 (TTAB 2013). In <i>Sheetz</i>, the Board determined that �[a]sking a
respondent whether he or she understood the difference is not the same as <i>testing</i>
whether she or he understood the difference.�(emphasis in original). As the
Board there noted, we can give �little weight� to a survey where a mini-test
was not performed and we do not know whether survey participants actually
understood what they were being asked. <i>Id.</i> at 1361-1362, <i>citing Jacob
Zimmerman v. National Association of Realtors,</i> 70 USPQ2d at 1435-36 n.5. We
reach this conclusion further on the basis that the two �don't know� and �not
sure� answers potentially were confusing to survey participants, and may have
lead those who understood the survey question to elect to indicate they did
not. Accordingly, for these reasons, we give Dr. Simonson's findings little
probative weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. E. Deborah Jay, founder and President of Field
Research Corp., was retained as an expert by counsel for defendant. She
conducted a survey between the 16th and 25th of February, 2010. The screening
criteria were defined as adults who had �personally purchased salty snacks for
themselves or for someone else in the past three months or think that they
would do this in the next three months.�(Jay report at 1). Initially 500 adults
were screened, but only 222 were found eligible after meeting the screening
criteria in a �double-blind� survey, conducted by phone. As a screening
gateway, in the <i>Teflon</i> format, respondents were given an explanation of
the difference between brand and common names, and then asked both whether
BAKED TOSTITOS is a brand or common name, and whether TORTILLA CHIPS is a brand
or common name. Only those who answered both correctly proceeded with the
survey. Those respondents then were questioned about a number of �brand� or
�common� names with the option of ��don't know.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of the 222 respondents who proceeded in the survey, the
results were as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0in'><span><img

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on these results, Dr. Jay concluded in her
report: �The survey found that the primary significance of the name � PRETZEL
CRISPS' to past and prospective purchasers of salty snacks is as a brand name
and not a common (generic) name. Fifty-five percent of survey respondents
thought that � PRETZEL CRISPS' was a brand name, whereas 36% thought � PRETZEL
CRISPS' was a common (or generic) name.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Simonson was retained by counsel for plaintiff
to rebut the conclusions of Dr. Jay. He noted that less than 65% of the initial
group �of qualified respondents� was entered into the survey due to the
underinclusive nature of the questions, and that accordingly, the Jay survey is
flawed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:120%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on the record evidence properly before us, we
find that �PRETZEL CRISPS,� as used by defendant, would be understood by the
relevant public to refer to �pretzel crackers.� The commonly understood meaning
of the words ��pretzel� and �crisps,� demonstrates that purchasers understand
that �PRETZEL CRISPS� identifies �pretzel crackers.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendant argued that the term cannot be generic
because there is no dictionary definition for �PRETZEL CRISPS� and no entries
in the encyclopedia. However, that is by no means dispositive. <i>See In re
Gould Paper Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 1017, 5 USPQ2d 1110, 1111 (Fed. Cir. 1987)
(SCREENWIPE held generic even though there was no dictionary definition of the
compound term); <i>In re Dairimetics, Ltd.,</i> 169 USPQ 572, 573 (TTAB 1971)
(ROSE MILK refused registration on the Supplemental Register even though there
was no dictionary definition of ROSE MILK). It also does not matter if
defendant was the first user or is the only user of the term PRETZEL CRISPS.
The law does not permit �anyone to obtain a complete monopoly on use of a
descriptive [or generic] term simply by grabbing it first.�<i>KP Permanent
Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.</i>, 543 U.S. 111, 122 (2004)
(citation omitted); <i>see also In re Pennington Seed, Inc.</i>, 466 F.3d 1053,
80 USPQ2d 1758, 1761-62 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (first user of seed varietal name not
entitled to monopoly on the name of the varietal); <i>In re Bailey Meter Co.</i>,
102 F.2d 843, 41 USPQ 275, 276 (CCPA 1939) (being �the first and only one to
adopt and use the mark sought to be registered does not prove that the mark is
not descriptive�); Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (�TMEP�) �
1209.03(c) (Oct. 2013 ed.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendant also argued that the term �crisps� is not
synonymous with crackers because there are several registrations containing
�CRISPS� where the term was not disclaimed. Of the nine registrations submitted
by defendant, however, only one was for �crackers,� and the others were for
other snack foods or cereals, which are not at issue in this case. As noted
above, we weigh the evidence accordingly, and on the balance, do not find the
overall evidence of registrations to affect our determination. Defendant also
argues regarding competitive use that it has removed references to �crisps� in
its nutritional information. While that may be so, that there is evidence in
the record of defendant's prior references is instructive and, in any case, the
record demonstrates the generic nature of the term �crisps.� We accordingly
find on this record that the designation �PRETZEL CRISPS� is generic for
�pretzel crackers.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In making this determination, while we consider the
entirety of the record, including the surveys (which in any event arrive at
different conclusions), we give controlling weight to the dictionary
definitions, evidence of use by the public, including use by the media and by
third-parties in the food industry, and evidence of use by defendant itself. <i>See
In re Hotels.com LP,</i> 573 F.3d 1300, 91 USPQ2d 1532 (Fed. Cir. 2009). We
note that in finding the term �PRETZEL CRISPS� as a whole to be generic, we have
analyzed it as a combined term, but were we to analyze it as a phrase, on this
record, our conclusion would be the same, as the words strung together as a
unified phrase also create a meaning that we find to be understood by the
relevant public as generic for ��pretzel crackers.� <i>See In re W.B. Coleman
Co.,</i> 93 USPQ2d 2019, 2025 (TTAB 2010) (analyzing proposed mark under <i>Gould</i>
standard, but finding result would be same under <i>American Fertility</i>).[FN13]</p>

Questions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Surveying for Genericism:
The �Thermos� Survey Method</i>.&nbsp; In <i>American Thermos Products Co. v.
Aladdin Industries, Inc.</i>, 207 F. Supp. 9 (D. Conn. 1962), aff'd, 321 F.2d
577 (2d Cir. 1963), the defendant argued that the term �thermos� had lost its
significance as a designation of source and become a generic term for vacuum-insulated
containers.&nbsp; To support this argument, the defendant submitted a survey
whose method has been copied in many subsequent genericism cases.&nbsp; <i>See,
e.g</i>., <i>E.T. Browne Drug Co. v. Cococare Products, Inc.</i>, 538 F.3d 185,
87 U.S.P.Q.2d 1655 (3d Cir. 2008) (evaluating <i>Thermos</i>-type
survey).&nbsp; <i>See also</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
�12:15.&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, a <i>Thermos</i> survey describes to the survey
respondent the general product at issue, asks the respondent to imagine
him/herself walking into a store and asking for that product, and then inquires
�What would you ask for&#8212;that is, what would you tell the clerk you
wanted?�&nbsp; The survey will then typically ask some form of the question
�Can you think of any other words that you would use to ask for the
product?�&nbsp; In <i>American Thermos Products</i>, 75% of the 3,300
respondents answered �Thermos� to the �what would you ask for� question.&nbsp; <i>American
Thermos Products</i>, 207 F. Supp. at 21-22.&nbsp; The court found that the
term �thermos� had become generic for vacuum-insulated bottles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Thermos survey method has been criticized on the ground
that �for a very strong trademark, respondents with brand loyalty may answer
with the trademark and drop what they consider to be a generic name, because
it's so obvious to them.�&nbsp; <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
�12:15.&nbsp; Imagine you walk into a fast food restaurant in order to purchase
a carbonated cola-flavored beverage.&nbsp; What would you ask for?&nbsp; What
do you think the results of such a survey of 100 respondents would be, and do
they support McCarthy�s criticism?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Surveying for Genericism:
The �Teflon� Survey Method</i>.&nbsp; In <i>E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.
v. Yoshida International, Inc.</i>, 393 F. Supp. 502 (E.D.N.Y. 1975), Dupont,
producer of <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>teflon</span> resins, brought
a trademark action against the defendant Yoshida, producer of <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>eflon</span> zippers. &nbsp;In response to
Yoshida�s argument that <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>teflon</span> had
become generic, DuPont submitted two surveys, one of which was a telephone
survey in which respondents were first given what was essentially a mini-course
in the difference between �brand names� and �common names� and then asked if
�teflon� was a brand name or a common name.&nbsp; The core of the survey script
proceeded as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>I'd like to read 8 names to you
and get you to tell me whether you think it is a brand name or a common name;
by <i>brand</i> name, I mean a word like <i>Chevrolet</i> which is made by one
company; by <i>common</i> name, I mean <i>a word like automobile</i> which is
made by a number of different companies. So if I were to ask you, �Is Chevrolet
a brand name or a common name?,� what would you say?</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Now, if I were to ask you, �Is
washing machine a brand name or a common name?,� what would you say?</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>[If respondent understands

<p class=MsoNormal>Interestingly, Yoshida submitted a Thermos survey to support
its claim that <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>teflon</span> had become
generic.&nbsp; As the court explained,&nbsp; this survey</p>

<p class=Blockquote>was conducted among adult women, 90.6% of whom expressed
awareness of �kitchen pots and pans that have their inside surfaces coated by
chemical substances to keep grease or food from sticking to them.� Of the aware
respondents, 86.1% apparently mentioned only �TEFLON� or �TEFLON II� [DuPont�s
mark for an improved means of applying its resin to metal surfaces] as their
sole answer when asked, �What is the name . . . or names of these pots and pans
. . .?� Further, 71.7% of the aware women gave only �TEFLON� or �TEFLON II� as
the name they would use to describe the pots and pans to a store clerk or
friend.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, 393 F.Supp.
at 525.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
court ultimately found DuPont�s brand name vs. common name survey to be the
most persuasive.&nbsp; In Yoshida�s Thermos survey (as in other surveys in the
case not discussed here), the court found, �respondents were, by the design of
the questions, more often than not focusing on supplying the inquirer a �name�,
without regard to whether the principal significance of the name supplied was
�its indication of the nature or class of an article, rather than an indication
of its origin.��&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 527 (quoting <i>King-Seeley Thermos Co</i>.,
321 F.2d at 580).&nbsp; Only DuPont�s brand name vs. common name survey</p>

<p class=Blockquote>really gets down to the critical element of the
case�.&nbsp; [T]he responses of the survey reveal that the public is quite good
at sorting out brand names from common names, and, for TEFLON, answers the
critical question left unanswered by the ambiguities inherent in [the other
surveys]&#8212;that of the principal significance of the TEFLON mark to the
public.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only have defendants failed to show that TEFLON's
principal significance is as a common noun, plaintiff has succeeded in showing
it to be a �brand name�&#8212;an indicator, in the words of DuPont's
questionnaire, of a product �made by one company.��</p>

at 527.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you agree that the Teflon survey method is superior to
the Thermos survey method for assessing whether a mark is generic?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The</i>
Antimonopoly <i>case and unique products</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Anti-Monopoly, Inc.
v. General Mills Fun Group, Inc</i>., 684 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. 1982), the Ninth
Circuit ruled that the declaratory defendant�s trademark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>monopoly</span> for the well-known board game
was generic.&nbsp; The court found the defendant�s Teflon survey to be
unpersuasive and relied instead on the declaratory plaintiff�s Thermos survey,
in which respondents �familiar with business board games of the kind in which
players buy, sell, mortgage and trade city streets, utilities and railroads,
build houses, collect rents and win by bankrupting all other players� were
asked: �If you were going to buy this kind of game, what would you ask for,
that is, what would you tell the sales clerk you wanted?�&nbsp; Approximately
80% answered �Monopoly.�&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit considered the objections to
the Thermos survey raised in <i>E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i> but
ultimately found the plaintiff�s Thermos survey to be �compelling evidence of a
proposition that is also dictated by common sense: an overwhelming proportion
of those who are familiar with the game would ask for it by the name �Monopoly.��&nbsp;
<i>Anti-Monopoly</i>, 684 F.2d at 1324.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what generated enormous controversy in the trademark bar
was the plaintiff�s �consumer motivation� survey.&nbsp; Based on language from
a previous Ninth Circuit opinion in the case, <i>Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. General
Mills Fun Group</i>, 611 F.2d 296 (Ninth Cir. 1979), the plaintiff presented a
survey of consumers who had recently purchased the monopoly board game or who
would purchase it in the near future.&nbsp; This survey asked respondents which
of two statements best expressed why they had or would purchase the game.&nbsp;
�Sixty-five percent chose: �I want a �Monopoly� game primarily because I am
interested in playing �Monopoly,� I don't much care who makes it.� Thirty-two
percent chose: �I would like Parker Brothers' �Monopoly� game primarily because
I like Parker Brothers' products.��&nbsp; <i>Anti-Monopoly</i>, 684 F.2d at
1325.&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit took this as strong evidence that the �the
primary significance of �Monopoly� is product rather than source.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What, if anything, is wrong with the Ninth Circuit�s
reasoning?&nbsp; In considering this question, note that the trademark bar was
so appalled by the implications of the Ninth Circuit�s reasoning that it
successfully lobbied for an amendment to the Lanham Act overruling the Ninth
Circuit.&nbsp; The Trademark Clarification Act of 1984 amended Section 14(3), 15
U.S.C. � 1064(3), to provide:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A registered mark shall not be deemed to be the generic
name of goods or services solely because such mark is also used as a name of or
to identify a unique product or service. The primary significance of the
registered mark to the relevant public rather than purchaser motivation shall
be the test for determining whether the registered mark has become the generic
name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Is <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>windows</span> for a computer operating system
generic?</i>&nbsp; On December 20, 2011, Microsoft filed suit against
Lindows.com (�Lindows�) alleging that Lindows� mark <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>lindows</span> for a Linux-based operating system infringed
Microsoft�s <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>windows</span> mark.&nbsp;
Lindows argued that <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>windows</span> was
generic at the time that Microsoft first began to use it in 1985.&nbsp; In <i>Microsoft
Corp. v. Lindows.com, Inc</i>., C01 Civ. 2115C, 2002 WL 31499324 (W.D.Wash.,
Mar. 15, 2002), the district court denied Microsoft�s motion for a preliminary
injunction, finding that there were �serious questions regarding whether
Windows is a non-generic name and thus eligible for the protections of federal
trademark law.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at *18.&nbsp; The case eventually settled
&#8212; with Microsoft agreeing to pay Lindows $20 million to change its name
(to Linspire) and cease using the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>lindows</span>
mark on any of its products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owners of very
well-known marks are especially weary of their marks� falling prey to
genericide through widespread generic usage.&nbsp; They typically developed and
seek to enforce strict policies on how their marks are used.&nbsp; See, e.g.,
Google, Rules for proper usage, <a
href="http://www.google.com/permissions/trademark/rules.html">http://www.google.com/permissions/trademark/rules.html</a>
(�Use a generic term following the trademark, for example: GOOGLE search
engine, Google search, GOOGLE web search�; �Use the trademark only as an
adjective, never as a noun or verb, and never in the plural or possessive
form.�; �If you do not capitalize the entire mark, always spell and capitalize
the trademark exactly as they are shown in the Google Trademarks and Suggested
Accepted Generic Terms.�). </p>

beginning of this Part, contemporary trademark law offers protection to far
more than words and phrases.&nbsp; It protects image marks, sound marks, scent
marks, and perhaps someday it will protect flavor or taste marks.&nbsp; <i>See
In re N.V. Organon</i>, 79 U.S.P.Q.2d 1639, 2006 WL 1723556 (TTAB 2006)
(denying registration to a mark consisting of �an orange flavor� for
�pharmaceuticals for human use, namely, antidepressants in quick-dissolving
tablets and pills� on the grounds that the mark lacked distinctiveness and was
functional).&nbsp; Trademark law also protects �trade dress,� which may consist
of a product�s packaging or configuration as well as nearly any other aspect of
the product or service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over the past two decades, courts have struggled with how to
analyze the distinctiveness of nonverbal marks, none more so than the Supreme
Court in a series of three opinions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span

style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc</i>., 529 U.S. 205
(2000) (analyzing the source-distinctiveness of an apparel design).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>In <i>Two Pesos</i>, the Court held that inherently
distinctive trade dress could be protected without a showing of secondary
meaning.&nbsp; In other words, and contrary to lower court case law primarily
from the Second Circuit, the Court held that there was no special rule
requiring that trade dress always show secondary meaning.&nbsp; In <i>Qualitex</i>,
the Court held that a single color could qualify for trademark protection.&nbsp;
Finally, in <i>Samara Bros</i>. (or <i>Wal-Mart</i>, as some courts prefer),
the Court arguably rewrote <i>Two Pesos</i>.&nbsp; It described the universe of
trade dress as consisting of at least two categories: product packaging trade
dress and product configuration trade dress.&nbsp; Product packaging trade
dress was deemed capable of being inherently distinctive and when it was, it
did not require a showing of secondary meaning to receive protection. Product
configuration trade dress, however, could never be inherently distinctive and
must always be shown to have acquired distinctiveness in order to qualify for
protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One area of distinctiveness doctrine that the Court has not
explicitly addressed is how to analyze the inherent distinctiveness of product
packaging.&nbsp; Should courts use the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum or some
other scheme of classification?&nbsp; As we will see below, there is a
significant circuit split on this issue.</p>

questions:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>The jury in <i>Two Pesos</i>
     presented to the Court a strange set of factual findings.&nbsp; The trade
     dress at issue was inherently distinctive but it lacked secondary

     asked, how must we define inherent distinctiveness and secondary meaning
     so that this can be logically possible?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>What concerns might have
     motivated the Second Circuit to create a rule that all trade dress must
     show secondary meaning to qualify for protection?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>The trade dress at issue in <i>Two
     Pesos</i> was unregistered and thus protected, if at all, under Section
     43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �1125(a).&nbsp; Should the unregistered
     status of the trade dress have any bearing on the court�s analysis of its
     distinctiveness?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>If, as <i>Two Pesos</i> holds,
     trade dress can be inherently distinctive, how should courts determine
     whether a specific instance of trade dress is in fact inherently
     distinctive?&nbsp; Should they simply apply the <i>Abercrombie</i>
     categories?&nbsp; Does <i>Two Pesos</i> offer any guidance on the matter?</li>

fast-food restaurants in Texas. The restaurants serve Mexican food. The first
Taco Cabana restaurant was opened in San Antonio in September 1978, and five
more restaurants had been opened in San Antonio by 1985. Taco Cabana describes
its Mexican trade dress as</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and
patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals. The
patio includes interior and exterior areas with the interior patio capable of
being sealed off from the outside patio by overhead garage doors. The stepped
exterior of the building is a festive and vivid color scheme using top border
paint and neon stripes. Bright awnings and umbrellas continue the theme.� 932
F.2d 1113, 1117 (CA5 1991).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In December 1985, a Two Pesos, Inc., restaurant was
opened in Houston. Two Pesos adopted a motif very similar to the foregoing
description of Taco Cabana's trade dress. Two Pesos restaurants expanded
rapidly in Houston and other markets, but did not enter San Antonio. In 1986,
Taco Cabana entered the Houston and Austin markets and expanded into other
Texas cities, including Dallas and El Paso where Two Pesos was also doing
business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span

infringement under � 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) (1982 ed.),<a

secrets under Texas common law. The case was tried to a jury, which was
instructed to return its verdict in the form of answers to five questions
propounded by the trial judge. The jury's answers were: Taco Cabana has a trade
dress; taken as a whole, the trade dress is nonfunctional; the trade dress is
inherently distinctive;<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

alleged infringement creates a likelihood of confusion on the part of ordinary
customers as to the source or association of the restaurant's goods or
services. Because, as the jury was told, Taco Cabana's trade dress was
protected if it either was inherently distinctive or had acquired a secondary meaning,
judgment was entered awarding damages to Taco Cabana. In the course of
calculating damages, the trial court held that Two Pesos had intentionally and
deliberately infringed Taco Cabana's trade dress.<a href="#_ftn41"

adequately stated the applicable law and that the evidence supported the jury's

distinctiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span

in the Fifth Circuit. In <i>Chevron Chemical Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing
Groups, Inc.,</i> 659 F.2d 695, 702 (CA5 1981), the court noted that trademark
law requires a demonstration of secondary meaning only when the claimed
trademark is not sufficiently distinctive of itself to identify the producer;
the court held that the same principles should apply to protection of trade
dresses. The Court of Appeals noted that this approach conflicts with decisions
of other courts, particularly the holding of the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in <i>Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc.,</i> 652
F.2d 299 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 909 (1982), that � 43(a) protects
unregistered trademarks or designs only where secondary meaning is shown. <i>Chevron,
supra,</i> at 702. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the
Courts of Appeals on the question whether trade dress that is inherently
distinctive is protectible under � 43(a) without a showing that it has acquired
secondary meaning. 502 U.S. 1071 (1992). We find that it is, and we therefore
affirm.</p>

Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 858 (1982), but it is common ground
that � 43(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks and that the general
principles qualifying a mark for registration under � 2 of the Lanham Act are
for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is
entitled to protection under � 43(a). See <i>A.J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman,</i>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;A trademark is defined in 15 U.S.C. � 1127 as
including �any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof� used
by any person �to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique
product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source
of the goods, even if that source is unknown.� In order to be registered, a
mark must be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of
others. � 1052. Marks are often classified in categories of generally
increasing distinctiveness; following the classic formulation set out by Judge
Friendly, they may be (1) generic; (2) descriptive; (3) suggestive; (4)
arbitrary; or (5) fanciful. See <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting
World, Inc.,</i> 537 F.2d 4, 9 (CA2 1976). The Court of Appeals followed this
classification and petitioner accepts it. Brief for Petitioner 11&#8211;15. The
latter three categories of marks, because their intrinsic nature serves to
identify a particular source of a product, are deemed inherently distinctive
and are entitled to protection. In contrast, generic marks&#8212;those that
�refe[r] to the genus of which the particular product is a species,� <i>Park 'N
Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc.,</i> 469 U.S. 189, 194 (1985), citing <i>Abercrombie
&amp; Fitch, supra,</i> at 9&#8212;are not registrable as trademarks. <i>Park
'N Fly, supra,</i> 469 U.S., at 194.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Marks which are merely descriptive of a product are
not inherently distinctive. When used to describe a product, they do not
inherently identify a particular source, and hence cannot be protected.
However, descriptive marks may acquire the distinctiveness which will allow
them to be protected under the Act. Section 2 of the Lanham Act provides that a
descriptive mark that otherwise could not be registered under the Act may be
registered if it �has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce.�
�� 2(e), (f), 15 U.S.C. �� 1052(e), (f). See <i>Park 'N Fly, supra,</i> at 194,
196. This acquired distinctiveness is generally called �secondary meaning.� See
<i>ibid.; Inwood Laboratories, supra,</i> 456 U.S., at 851, n. 11; <i>Kellogg
Co. v. National Biscuit Co.,</i> 305 U.S. 111, 118 (1938). The concept of
secondary meaning has been applied to actions under � 43(a). See, <i>e.g.,
University of Georgia Athletic Assn. v. Laite,</i> 756 F.2d 1535 (CA11 1985); <i>Thompson
Medical Co. v. Pfizer Inc., supra.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The general rule regarding distinctiveness is
clear: An identifying mark is distinctive and capable of being protected if it <i>either</i>
(1) is inherently distinctive <i>or</i> (2) has acquired distinctiveness
through secondary meaning. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition � 13, pp.
37&#8211;38, and Comment <i>a</i> (Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990). Cf. <i>Park
'N Fly, supra,</i> 469 U.S., at 194. It is also clear that eligibility for
protection under � 43(a) depends on nonfunctionality. See, <i>e.g., Inwood
Laboratories, supra,</i> 456 U.S., at 863 (WHITE, J., concurring in result);
see also, <i>e.g., Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co.,</i> 832 F.2d 513, 517
(CA10 1987); <i>First Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyers, Inc.,</i> 809 F.2d 1378,

<i>American Greetings Corp. v. Dan&#8211;Dee Imports, Inc.,</i> 807 F.2d 1136,
1141 (CA3 1986). It is, of course, also undisputed that liability under � 43(a)
requires proof of the likelihood of confusion. See, <i>e.g., Brunswick Corp.,
supra,</i> at 516&#8211;517; <i>AmBrit, supra,</i> at 1535; <i>First Brands,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court of Appeals determined that the District
Court's instructions were consistent with the foregoing principles and that the
evidence supported the jury's verdict. Both courts thus ruled that Taco
Cabana's trade dress was not descriptive but rather inherently distinctive, and
that it was not functional. None of these rulings is before us in this case,
and for present purposes we assume, without deciding, that each of them is
correct. In going on to affirm the judgment for respondent, the Court of Appeals,
following its prior decision in <i>Chevron,</i> held that Taco Cabana's
inherently distinctive trade dress was entitled to protection despite the lack
of proof of secondary meaning. It is this issue that is before us for decision,
and we agree with its resolution by the Court of Appeals. There is no
persuasive reason to apply to trade dress a general requirement of secondary
meaning which is at odds with the principles generally applicable to
infringement suits under � 43(a). Petitioner devotes much of its briefing to
arguing issues that are not before us, and we address only its arguments
relevant to whether proof of secondary meaning is essential to qualify an
inherently distinctive trade dress for protection under � 43(a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Petitioner argues that the jury's finding that the
trade dress has not acquired a secondary meaning shows conclusively that the
trade dress is not inherently distinctive. Brief for Petitioner 9. The Court of
Appeals' disposition of this issue was sound:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�Two Pesos' argument&#8212;that the jury finding of
inherent distinctiveness contradicts its finding of no secondary meaning in the
Texas market&#8212;ignores the law in this circuit. While the necessarily
imperfect (and often prohibitively difficult) methods for assessing secondary
meaning address the empirical question of current consumer association, the
legal recognition of an inherently distinctive trademark or trade dress
acknowledges the owner's legitimate proprietary interest in its unique and
valuable informational device, regardless of whether substantial consumer
association yet bestows the additional empirical protection of secondary
meaning.� 932 F.2d, at 1120, n. 7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although petitioner makes the above argument, it
appears to concede elsewhere in its brief that it is possible for a trade
dress, even a restaurant trade dress, to be inherently distinctive and thus
eligible for protection under � 43(a). Brief for Petitioner 10&#8211;11,
17&#8211;18; Reply Brief for Petitioner 10&#8211;14. Recognizing that a general
requirement of secondary meaning imposes �an unfair prospect of theft [or]
financial loss� on the developer of fanciful or arbitrary trade dress at the
outset of its use, petitioner suggests that such trade dress should receive
limited protection without proof of secondary meaning. <i>Id.,</i> at 10.
Petitioner argues that such protection should be only temporary and subject to
defeasance when over time the dress has failed to acquire a secondary meaning.
This approach is also vulnerable for the reasons given by the Court of Appeals.
If temporary protection is available from the earliest use of the trade dress,
it must be because it is neither functional nor descriptive, but an inherently
distinctive dress that is capable of identifying a particular source of the
product. Such a trade dress, or mark, is not subject to copying by concerns
that have an equal opportunity to choose their own inherently distinctive trade
dress. To terminate protection for failure to gain secondary meaning over some
unspecified time could not be based on the failure of the dress to retain its
fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive nature, but on the failure of the user of
the dress to be successful enough in the marketplace. This is not a valid basis
to find a dress or mark ineligible for protection. The user of such a trade
dress should be able to maintain what competitive position it has and continue
to seek wider identification among potential customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This brings us to the line of decisions by the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that would find protection for trade
dress unavailable absent proof of secondary meaning, a position that petitioner
concedes would have to be modified if the temporary protection that it suggests
is to be recognized. Brief for Petitioner 10&#8211;14. In <i>Vibrant Sales,
Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc.,</i> 652 F.2d 299 (1981), the plaintiff claimed
protection under � 43(a) for a product whose features the defendant had
allegedly copied. The Court of Appeals held that unregistered marks did not
enjoy the �presumptive source association� enjoyed by registered marks and
hence could not qualify for protection under � 43(a) without proof of secondary
meaning. <i>Id.,</i> at 303, 304. The court's rationale seemingly denied
protection for unregistered, but inherently distinctive, marks of all kinds,
whether the claimed mark used distinctive words or symbols or distinctive
product design. The court thus did not accept the arguments that an
unregistered mark was capable of identifying a source and that copying such a
mark could be making any kind of a false statement or representation under �
43(a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This holding is in considerable tension with the
provisions of the Lanham Act. If a verbal or symbolic mark or the features of a
product design may be registered under � 2, it necessarily is a mark �by which
the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others,� 60
Stat. 428, and must be registered unless otherwise disqualified. Since � 2
requires secondary meaning only as a condition to registering descriptive
marks, there are plainly marks that are registrable without showing secondary
meaning. These same marks, even if not registered, remain inherently capable of
distinguishing the goods of the users of these marks. Furthermore, the copier
of such a mark may be seen as falsely claiming that his products may for some
reason be thought of as originating from the plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Some years after <i>Vibrant,</i> the Second Circuit
announced in <i>Thompson Medical Co. v. Pfizer Inc.,</i> 753 F.2d 208 (1985),
that in deciding whether an unregistered mark is eligible for protection under
� 43(a), it would follow the classification of marks set out by Judge Friendly
in <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,</i> 537 F.2d, at 9. Hence, if an unregistered
mark is deemed merely descriptive, which the verbal mark before the court
proved to be, proof of secondary meaning is required; however, �[s]uggestive
marks are eligible for protection without any proof of secondary meaning, since
the connection between the mark and the source is presumed.� 753 F.2d, at 216.
The Second Circuit has nevertheless continued to deny protection for trade
dress under � 43(a) absent proof of secondary meaning, despite the fact that �
43(a) provides no basis for distinguishing between trademark and trade dress.
See, <i>e.g., Stormy Clime Ltd. v. ProGroup, Inc.,</i> 809 F.2d, at 974; <i>Union
Mfg. Co. v. Han Baek Trading Co.,</i> 763 F.2d 42, 48 (1985); <i>LeSportsac,
Inc. v. K mart Corp.,</i> 754 F.2d 71, 75 (1985).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Fifth Circuit was quite right in <i>Chevron,</i>
and in this case, to follow the <i>Abercrombie</i> classifications consistently
and to inquire whether trade dress for which protection is claimed under �
43(a) is inherently distinctive. If it is, it is capable of identifying
products or services as coming from a specific source and secondary meaning is
not required. This is the rule generally applicable to trademarks, and the
protection of trademarks and trade dress under � 43(a) serves the same
statutory purpose of preventing deception and unfair competition. There is no
persuasive reason to apply different analysis to the two. The �proposition that
secondary meaning must be shown even if the trade dress is a distinctive,
identifying mark, [is] wrong, for the reasons explained by Judge Rubin for the
Fifth Circuit in <i>Chevron.</i>� <i>Blau Plumbing, Inc. v. S.O.S.
Fix&#8211;It, Inc.,</i> 781 F.2d 604, 608 (CA7 1986). The Court of Appeals for
the Eleventh Circuit also follows <i>Chevron, AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc.,</i>
805 F.2d 974, 979 (1986), and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears
to think that proof of secondary meaning is superfluous if a trade dress is
inherently distinctive, <i>Fuddruckers, Inc. v. Doc's B.R. Others, Inc.,</i>
826 F.2d 837, 843 (1987).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It would be a different matter if there were
textual basis in � 43(a) for treating inherently distinctive verbal or symbolic
trademarks differently from inherently distinctive trade dress. But there is
none. The section does not mention trademarks or trade dress, whether they be
called generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, fanciful, or functional.
Nor does the concept of secondary meaning appear in the text of � 43(a). Where
secondary meaning does appear in the statute, 15 U.S.C. � 1052 (1982 ed.), it
is a requirement that applies only to merely descriptive marks and not to
inherently distinctive ones. We see no basis for requiring secondary meaning
for inherently distinctive trade dress protection under � 43(a) but not for
other distinctive words, symbols, or devices capable of identifying a
producer's product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Engrafting onto � 43(a) a requirement of secondary
meaning for inherently distinctive trade dress also would undermine the
purposes of the Lanham Act. Protection of trade dress, no less than of
trademarks, serves the Act's purpose to �secure to the owner of the mark the
goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish
among competing producers. National protection of trademarks is desirable,
Congress concluded, because trademarks foster competition and the maintenance
of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation.� <i>Park
'N Fly,</i> 469 U.S., at 198, 105 S.Ct., at 663, citing S.Rep. No. 1333, 79th
Cong., 2d Sess., 3&#8211;5 (1946) (citations omitted). By making more difficult
the identification of a producer with its product, a secondary meaning
requirement for a nondescriptive trade dress would hinder improving or
maintaining the producer's competitive position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Suggestions that under the Fifth Circuit's law, the
initial user of any shape or design would cut off competition from products of
like design and shape are not persuasive. Only nonfunctional, distinctive trade
dress is protected under � 43(a). The Fifth Circuit holds that a design is
legally functional, and thus unprotectible, if it is one of a limited number of
equally efficient options available to competitors and free competition would be
unduly hindered by according the design trademark protection. See <i>Sicilia Di
R. Biebow &amp; Co. v. Cox,</i> 732 F.2d 417, 426 (1984). This serves to assure
that competition will not be stifled by the exhaustion of a limited number of
trade dresses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the other hand, adding a secondary meaning
requirement could have anticompetitive effects, creating particular burdens on
the startup of small companies. It would present special difficulties for a
business, such as respondent, that seeks to start a new product in a limited
area and then expand into new markets. Denying protection for inherently
distinctive nonfunctional trade dress until after secondary meaning has been
established would allow a competitor, which has not adopted a distinctive trade
dress of its own, to appropriate the originator's dress in other markets and to
deter the originator from expanding into and competing in these areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted above, petitioner concedes that protecting
an inherently distinctive trade dress from its inception may be critical to new
entrants to the market and that withholding protection until secondary meaning
has been established would be contrary to the goals of the Lanham Act.
Petitioner specifically suggests, however, that the solution is to dispense
with the requirement of secondary meaning for a reasonable, but brief, period
at the outset of the use of a trade dress. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11&#8211;12.
If � 43(a) does not require secondary meaning at the outset of a business'
adoption of trade dress, there is no basis in the statute to support the
suggestion that such a requirement comes into being after some unspecified
time.</p>

interprets this section as having created a federal cause of action for
infringement of an unregistered trademark or trade dress and concludes that
such a mark or dress should receive essentially the same protection as those
that are registered. Although I agree with the Court's conclusion, I think it
is important to recognize that the meaning of the text has been transformed by
the federal courts over the past few decades. I agree with this transformation,
even though it marks a departure from the original text, because it is
consistent with the purposes of the statute and has recently been endorsed by

<sup>FN2</sup> provides a federal remedy for using either �a false designation
of origin� or a �false description or representation� in connection with any
goods or services. The full text of the section makes it clear that the word
�origin� refers to the geographic location in which the goods originated, and
in fact, the phrase �false designation of origin� was understood to be limited
to false advertising of geographic origin. For example, the �false designation
of origin� language contained in the statute makes it unlawful to represent
that California oranges came from Florida, or vice versa.<a href="#_ftn45"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For a number of years after the 1946 enactment of
the Lanham Act, a �false description or representation,� like �a false
designation of origin,� was construed narrowly. The phrase encompassed two
kinds of wrongs: false advertising<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span

False advertising meant representing that goods or services possessed
characteristics that they did not actually have and passing off meant
representing one's goods as those of another. Neither �secondary meaning� nor
�inherent distinctiveness� had anything to do with false advertising, but proof
of secondary meaning was an element of the common-law passing-off cause of
action. See, <i>e.g., G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield,</i> 198 F. 369, 372
(CA6 1912) (�The ultimate offense always is that defendant has passed off his

than mere �palming off.� <i>L'Aiglon Apparel, Inc. v. Lana Lobell, Inc.,</i>
214 F.2d 649 (CA3 1954). The court explained: �We find nothing in the
legislative history of the Lanham Act to justify the view that [� 43(a) ] is
merely declarative of existing law.... It seems to us that Congress has defined

given a broad class of suitors injured or likely to be injured by such wrong
the right to relief in the federal courts.� <i>Id.,</i> at 651. Judge Clark,

The United States Trade Association Trademark Review Commission noted this
transformation with approval: �Section 43(a) is an enigma, but a very popular
one. Narrowly drawn and intended to reach false designations or representations
as to the geographical origin of products, the section has been widely
interpreted to create, in essence, a federal law of unfair competition.... It
has definitely eliminated a gap in unfair competition law, and its vitality is
showing no signs of age.�<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span

because in either case � 43(a) may be invoked. The federal courts are in
agreement that � 43(a) creates a federal cause of action for trademark and
trade dress infringement claims. 1 J. Gilson, Trademark Protection and Practice
� 2.13, p. 2&#8211;178 (1991). They are also in agreement that the test for
liability is likelihood of confusion: �[U]nder the Lanham Act [� 43(a) ], the
ultimate test is whether the public is likely to be deceived or confused by the
similarity of the marks.... Whether we call the violation infringement, unfair
competition or false designation of origin, the test is identical&#8212;is
there a �likelihood of confusion?� � <i>New West Corp. v. NYM Co. of California,
Inc.,</i> 595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (CA9 1979) (footnote omitted). And the Circuits
are in general agreement,<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even though the lower courts' expansion of the
categories contained in � 43(a) is unsupported by the text of the Act, I am
persuaded that it is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. For
example, Congressman Lanham, the bill's sponsor, stated: �The purpose of [the
Act] is to protect legitimate business and the consumers of the country.�<a

One way of accomplishing these dual goals was by creating uniform legal rights
and remedies that were appropriate for a national economy. Although the
protection of trademarks had once been �entirely a State matter,� the result of
such a piecemeal approach was that there were almost �as many different
varieties of common law as there are States� so that a person's right to a
trademark �in one State may differ widely from the rights which [that person]
enjoys in another.� H.R.Rep. No. 944, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1939). The
House Committee on Trademarks and Patents, recognizing that �trade is no longer
local, but ...national,� saw the need for �national legislation along national
lines [to] secur[e] to the owners of trademarks in interstate commerce definite
rights.� <i>Ibid.</i><a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Congress has revisited this statute from time to
time, and has accepted the �judicial legislation� that has created this federal
cause of action. Recently, for example, in the Trademark Law Revision Act of
1988, 102 Stat. 3935, Congress codified the judicial interpretation of � 43(a),
giving its <i>imprimatur</i> to a growing body of case law from the Circuits
that had expanded the section beyond its original language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although Congress has not specifically addressed
the question whether secondary meaning is required under � 43(a), the steps it
has taken in this subsequent legislation suggest that secondary meaning is not
required if inherent distinctiveness has been established.<a href="#_ftn59"
name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[59]</span></span></span></a> First, Congress broadened
the language of � 43(a) to make explicit that the provision prohibits �any
word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof� that is
�likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the
affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or
as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or
commercial activities by another person.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a). That language
makes clear that a confusingly similar trade dress is actionable under � 43(a),
without necessary reference to �falsity.� Second, Congress approved and
confirmed the extensive judicial development under the provision, including its
application to trade dress that the federal courts had come to apply.<a
href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[60]</span></span></span></a> Third, the legislative history
of the 1988 amendments reaffirms Congress' goals of protecting both businesses
and consumers with the Lanham Act.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[61]</span></span></span></a>
And fourth, Congress explicitly extended to any violation of � 43(a) the basic
Lanham Act remedial provisions whose text previously covered only registered
trademarks.<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[62]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
The aim of the amendments was to apply the same protections to unregistered
marks as were already afforded to registered marks. See S.Rep. No.
100&#8211;515, p. 40 (1988). These steps buttress the conclusion that � 43(a)
is properly understood to provide protection in accordance with the standards
for registration in � 2. These aspects of the 1988 legislation bolster the
claim that an inherently distinctive trade dress may be protected under � 43(a)
without proof of secondary meaning.</p>

1991). Qualitex subsequently added a trademark infringement count, 15 U.S.C. �
1114(1), to an unfair competition claim, � 1125(a), in a lawsuit it had already
filed challenging Jacobson's use of the green-gold color.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span

1991 WL 318798 (CD Cal.1991). But, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
set aside the judgment in Qualitex's favor on the trademark infringement claim
because, in that Circuit's view, the Lanham Act does not permit Qualitex, or
anyone else, to register �color alone� as a trademark. 13 F.3d 1297, 1300, 1302

against protection of color alone), with <i>In re Owens&#8211;Corning Fiberglas

exclusive right to �register� a trademark, 15 U.S.C. � 1052 (1988 ed. and Supp.
V), and to prevent his or her competitors from using that trademark, � 1114(1).
Both the language of the Act and the basic underlying principles of trademark
law would seem to include color within the universe of things that can qualify
as a trademark. The language of the Lanham Act describes that universe in the
broadest of terms. It says that trademarks �includ[e] any word, name, symbol,
or device, or any combination thereof.� � 1127. Since human beings might use as
a �symbol� or �device� almost anything at <a name="sp_708_1303"></a><a

that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not
restrictive. The courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for
use as a mark a particular shape (of a Coca&#8211;Cola bottle), a particular
sound (of NBC's three chimes), and even a particular scent (of plumeria
blossoms on sewing thread). See, <i>e.g.,</i> Registration No. 696,147 (Apr.

do the same?</p>

Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992). The imaginary word �Suntost,�
or the words �Suntost Marmalade,� on a jar of orange jam immediately would
signal a brand or a product �source�; the jam's orange color does not do so.
But, over time, customers may come to treat a particular color on a product or
its packaging (say, a color that in context seems unusual, such as pink on a
firm's insulating material or red on the head of a large industrial bolt) as
signifying a brand. And, if so, that color would have come to identify and
distinguish the goods&#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> �to indicate� their
�source�&#8212;much in the way that descriptive words on a product (say, �Trim�
on nail clippers or �Car&#8211;Freshner� on deodorizer) can come to indicate a
product's origin. See, <i>e.g., J. Wiss &amp; Sons Co. v. W.E. Bassett Co.,</i>

circumstance, trademark law says that the word ( <i>e.g.,</i> �Trim�), although
not inherently distinctive, has developed �secondary meaning.� See <i>Inwood
Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 851, n. 11,
(1982) (�[S]econdary meaning� is acquired when �in the minds of the public, the
primary significance of a product feature ... is to identify the source of the
product rather than the product itself�). Again, one might ask, if trademark
law permits a descriptive word with secondary meaning to act as a mark, why
would it not permit a color, under similar circumstances, to do the same?</p>

law any obvious theoretical objection to the use of color alone as a trademark,
where that color has attained �secondary meaning� and therefore identifies and
distinguishes a particular brand (and thus indicates its �source�). In
principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying
mark, �reduce[s] the customer's costs of shopping <a name="sp_780_164"></a><a
name="SDU_164"></a>and making purchasing decisions,� 1 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on

that <i>this</i> item&#8212;the item with this mark&#8212;is made by the same
producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in
the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not an
imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards
associated with a desirable product. The law thereby �encourage[s] the
production of quality products,� <i>ibid.,</i> and simultaneously discourages
those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's
inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. See, <i>e.g.,</i>

basic purposes. See Landes &amp; Posner, Trademark Law: An Economic

difficult to find, in basic trademark objectives, a reason to disqualify
absolutely the use of a color as a mark.</p>

style='color:gray'>[</span></a></a><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Neither can we find a principled objection to the
use of color as a mark in the important �functionality� doctrine of trademark
law. The functionality doctrine prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote
competition by protecting a firm's reputation, from instead inhibiting
legitimate competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product
feature. It is the province of patent law, not trademark law, to encourage
invention by granting inventors a monopoly over new product designs or
functions for a limited time, 35 U.S.C. �� 154, 173, after which competitors
are free to use the innovation. If a product's functional features could be <a
name="sp_780_165"></a><a name="SDU_165"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*165,_115"></a>used as trademarks,
however, a monopoly over such features could be obtained without regard to
whether they qualify as patents and could be extended forever (because
trademarks may be renewed in perpetuity). See <i>Kellogg Co. v. National
Biscuit Co.,</i> 305 U.S. 111, 119&#8211;120 (1938) (Brandeis, J.); <i>Inwood
Laboratories, Inc., supra,</i> 456 U.S., at 863 (White, J., concurring in
result) (�A functional characteristic is �an important ingredient in the
commercial success of the product,� and, after expiration of a patent, it is no
more the property of the originator than the product itself�) (citation
omitted). Functionality doctrine therefore would require, to take an imaginary
example, that even if customers have come to identify the special
illumination-enhancing shape of a new patented light bulb with a particular
manufacturer, the manufacturer may not use that shape as a trademark, for doing
so, after the patent had expired, would impede competition&#8212;not by
protecting the reputation of the original bulb maker, but by frustrating
competitors' legitimate efforts to produce an equivalent illumination-enhancing
bulb. See, <i>e.g., Kellogg Co., supra,</i> 305 U.S., at 119&#8211;120
(trademark law cannot be used to extend monopoly over �pillow� shape of
shredded wheat biscuit after the patent for that shape had expired). This Court
consequently has explained that, �[i]n general terms, a product feature is
functional,� and cannot serve as a trademark, �if it is essential to the use or
purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article,�
that is, if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant
non-reputation-related disadvantage. <i>Inwood Laboratories, Inc., supra,</i>
456 U.S., at 850, n. 10. Although sometimes color plays an important role
(unrelated to source identification) in making a product more desirable,
sometimes it does not. And, this latter fact&#8212;the fact that sometimes
color is not essential to a product's use or purpose and does not affect cost
or quality&#8212;indicates that the doctrine of �functionality� does not create
an absolute bar to the use of color alone as a mark. See <i>Owens&#8211;Corning,</i>
774 F.2d, at 1123 (pink color of insulation in wall �performs no nontrademark
function�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It would seem, then, that color alone, at least
sometimes, can meet the basic legal requirements for use as a trademark. It can
act as a symbol that distinguishes a firm's goods and identifies their source,
without serving any other significant function. See U.S. Dept. of Commerce,
Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure �
1202.04(e), p. 1202&#8211;13 (2d ed. May, 1993) (hereinafter PTO Manual)
(approving trademark registration of color alone where it �has become
distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce,� provided that �there is [no]
competitive need for colors to remain available in the industry� and the color
is not �functional�); see also 1 McCarthy �� 3.01[1], 7.26, pp. 3&#8211;2,
7&#8211;113 (�requirements for qualification of a word or symbol as a
trademark� are that it be (1) a �symbol,� (2) �use[d] ... as a mark,� (3) �to
identify and distinguish the seller's goods from goods made or sold by others,�
but that it not be �functional�). Indeed, the District Court, in this case,
entered findings (accepted by the <a name="sp_708_1305"></a><a name="SDU_1305"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*166,_115"></a>Ninth Circuit) that show
Qualitex's green-gold press pad color has met these requirements. The
green-gold color acts as a symbol. Having developed secondary meaning (for
customers identified the green-gold color as Qualitex's), it identifies the
press pads' source. And, the green-gold color serves no other function.
(Although it is important to use <i>some</i> color on press pads to avoid
noticeable stains, the court found �no competitive need in the press pad
industry for the green-gold color, since other colors are equally usable.� 21
U.S.P.Q.2d, at 1460.) Accordingly, unless there is some special reason that
convincingly militates against the use of color alone as a trademark, trademark
law would protect Qualitex's use of the green-gold color on its press pads.</p>

style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>First,</i>
Jacobson says that, if the law permits the use of color as a trademark, it will
produce uncertainty and unresolvable court disputes about what shades of a
color a competitor may lawfully use. Because lighting (morning sun, twilight
mist) will affect perceptions of protected color, competitors and courts will
suffer from �shade confusion� as they try to decide whether use of a similar
color on a similar product does, or does not, confuse customers and thereby
infringe a trademark. Jacobson adds that the �shade confusion� problem is �more
difficult� and �far different from� the �determination of the similarity of
words or symbols.� Brief for Respondent 22.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We do not believe, however, that color, in this
respect, is special. Courts traditionally decide quite difficult questions
about whether two words or phrases or symbols are sufficiently similar, in
context, to confuse buyers. They have had to compare, for example, such words
as �Bonamine� and �Dramamine� (motion-sickness remedies); �Huggies� and
�Dougies� (diapers); �Cheracol� and �Syrocol� (cough syrup); �Cyclone� and
�Tornado� (wire fences); and �Mattres� and �1&#8211;800&#8211;Mattres�
(mattress franchisor telephone numbers). See, <i>e.g., G.D. Searle &amp; Co. v.
Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co.,</i> 265 F.2d 385, 389 (CA7 1959); <i>Kimberly&#8211;Clark
Corp. v. H. Douglas Enterprises, Ltd.,</i> 774 F.2d 1144, 1146&#8211;1147 (CA
Fed.1985); <i>Upjohn Co. v. Schwartz,</i> 246 F.2d 254, 262 (CA2 1957); <i>Hancock
v. American Steel &amp; Wire Co. of N.J.,</i> 40 C.C.P.A. (Pat.) 931, 935, 203
F.2d 737, 740&#8211;741 (1953); <i>Dial&#8211;A&#8211;Mattress Franchise Corp.
v. Page,</i> 880 F.2d 675, 678 (CA2 1989). Legal standards exist to guide courts
in making such comparisons. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2 McCarthy � 15.08; 1 McCarthy ��
11.24&#8211;11.25 (�[S]trong� marks, with greater secondary meaning, receive
broader protection than �weak� marks). We do not see why courts could not apply
those standards to a color, replicating, if necessary, lighting conditions
under <a name="sp_780_168"></a><a name="SDU_168"></a>which a colored product is
normally sold. See Ebert, Trademark Protection in Color: Do It By the Numbers!,
84 T.M.Rep. 379, 405 (1994). Indeed, courts already have done so in cases where
a trademark consists of a color plus a design, <i>i.e.,</i> a colored symbol
such as a gold stripe (around a sewer pipe), a yellow strand of wire rope, or a
�brilliant yellow� band (on ampules). See, <i>e.g., Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube
Co. v. Tallman Conduit Co.,</i> 149 U.S.P.Q. 656, 657 (TTAB 1966); <i>Amsted
Industries, Inc. v. West Coast Wire Rope &amp; Rigging Inc.,</i> 2 U.S.P.Q.2d
1755, 1760 (TTAB 1987); <i>In re Hodes&#8211;Lange Corp.,</i> 167 U.S.P.Q. 255,

style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Second,</i>
Jacobson argues, as have others, that colors are in limited supply. See, <i>e.g.,
NutraSweet Co.,</i> 917 F.2d, at 1028; <i>Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour &amp;
Co.,</i> 175 F.2d 795, 798 (CA3 1949). Jacobson claims that, if one of many
competitors can appropriate a particular color for use as a trademark, and each
competitor then tries to do the same, the supply of colors will soon be
depleted. Put in its strongest form, this argument would concede that
�[h]undreds of color pigments are manufactured and thousands of colors can be
obtained by mixing.� L. Cheskin, Colors: What They Can Do For You 47 (1947).
But, it would add that, in the context of a particular product, only some
colors are usable. By the time one discards <a name="sp_708_1306"></a><a
name="SDU_1306"></a><a name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*168,_115"></a>colors
that, say, for reasons of customer appeal, are not usable, and adds the shades
that competitors cannot use lest they risk infringing a similar, registered
shade, then one is left with only a handful of possible colors. And, under
these circumstances, to permit one, or a few, producers to use colors as
trademarks will �deplete� the supply of usable colors to the point where a
competitor's inability to find a suitable color will put that competitor at a
significant disadvantage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="SDU_6"><a name="sp_999_6"><span style='color:gray'>[</span></a></a><span
style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> This
argument is unpersuasive, however, largely because it relies on an occasional
problem to justify a blanket prohibition. When a color serves as a mark,
normally alternative colors will likely be available for similar use by others.
See, <i>e.g., Owens&#8211;Corning,</i> 774 F.2d, at 1121 (pink insulation). <a
name="sp_780_169"></a><a name="SDU_169"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*169,_115"></a>Moreover, if that is not
so&#8212;if a �color depletion� or �color scarcity� problem does
arise&#8212;the trademark doctrine of �functionality� normally would seem
available to prevent the anticompetitive consequences that Jacobson's argument
posits, thereby minimizing that argument's practical force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The functionality doctrine, as we have said,
forbids the use of a product's feature as a trademark where doing so will put a
competitor at a significant disadvantage because the feature is �essential to
the use or purpose of the article� or �affects [its] cost or quality.� <i>Inwood
Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U.S., at 850, n. 10. The functionality doctrine
thus protects competitors against a disadvantage (unrelated to recognition or
reputation) that trademark protection might otherwise impose, namely, their
inability reasonably to replicate important non-reputation-related product
features. For example, this Court has written that competitors might be free to
copy the color of a medical pill where that color serves to identify the kind
of medication ( <i>e.g.,</i> a type of blood medicine) in addition to its
source. See <i>id.,</i> at 853, 858, n. 20 (�[S]ome patients commingle
medications in a container and rely on color to differentiate one from
another�); see also J. Ginsburg, D. Goldberg, &amp; A. Greenbaum, Trademark and
Unfair Competition Law 194&#8211;195 (1991) (noting that drug color cases �have
more to do with public health policy� regarding generic drug substitution �than
with trademark law�). And, the federal courts have demonstrated that they can
apply this doctrine in a careful and reasoned manner, with sensitivity to the
effect on competition. Although we need not comment on the merits of specific
cases, we note that lower courts have permitted competitors to copy the green
color of farm machinery (because customers wanted their farm equipment to
match) and have barred the use of black as a trademark on outboard boat motors
(because black has the special functional attributes of decreasing the apparent
size of the motor and ensuring compatibility with many different boat colors).
See <a name="sp_780_170"></a><a name="SDU_170"></a><i>Deere &amp; Co. v.
Farmhand, Inc.,</i> 560 F.Supp. 85, 98 (SD Iowa 1982), aff'd, 721 F.2d 253 (CA8

color of fertilizer held functional because it indicated the presence of
nitrogen). The Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition adds that, if a
design's �aesthetic value� lies in its ability to �confe[r] a significant
benefit that cannot practically be duplicated by the use of alternative
designs,� then the design is �functional.� Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition � 17, Comment <i>c,</i> pp. 175&#8211;176 (1993). The �ultimate
test of aesthetic functionality,� it explains, �is whether the recognition of

significant nontrademark function&#8212;whether to distinguish a heart pill
from a digestive medicine or to satisfy the �noble instinct for giving the
right touch of beauty to common and necessary things,� G. Chesterton,
Simplicity and Tolstoy 61 (1912)&#8212;courts will examine whether its use as a
mark would permit one competitor (or a group) to interfere with legitimate
(nontrademark-related) competition through actual or potential exclusive use of
an important product ingredient. That examination should not discourage firms
from creating esthetically pleasing mark designs, for it is open to their
competitors to do the same. See, <i>e.g., <a name="sp_708_1307"></a><a

Rogers Co. v. Keene,</i> 778 F.2d 334, 343 (CA7 1985) (Posner, J.). But,
ordinarily, it should prevent the anticompetitive consequences of Jacobson's
hypothetical �color depletion� argument, when, and if, the circumstances of a
particular case threaten �color depletion.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Third,</i> Jacobson points to many older cases&#8212;including
Supreme Court cases&#8212;in support of its position. In 1878, this Court
described the common-law definition of trademark rather broadly to �consist of

designate the goods he manufactures or sells to distinguish the same from those
manufactured or sold by another.� <i>McLean v. Fleming,</i> 96 U.S. 245, 254.
Yet, in interpreting the Trademark Acts of 1881 and 1905, 21 Stat. 502, 33
Stat. 724, which retained that common-law definition, the Court questioned
�[w]hether mere color can constitute a valid trade-mark,� <i>A. Leschen &amp;
Sons Rope Co. v. Broderick &amp; Bascom Rope Co.,</i> 201 U.S. 166, 171 (1906),
and suggested that the �product including the coloring matter is free to all
who make it,� <i>Coca&#8211;Cola Co. v. Koke Co. of America,</i> 254 U.S. 143,
147 (1920). Even though these statements amounted to dicta, lower courts
interpreted them as forbidding protection for color alone. See, <i>e.g., Campbell
Soup Co.,</i> 175 F.2d, at 798, and n. 9; <i>Life Savers Corp. v. Curtiss Candy
Co.,</i> 182 F.2d 4, 9 (CA7 1950) (quoting <i>Campbell Soup, supra,</i> at
798).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These Supreme Court cases, however, interpreted
trademark law as it existed <i>before</i> 1946, when Congress enacted the
Lanham Act. The Lanham Act significantly changed and liberalized the common law
to �dispense with mere technical prohibitions,� S.Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d
Sess., 3 (1946), most notably, by permitting trademark registration of
descriptive words (say, �U&#8211;Build&#8211;It� model airplanes) where they
had acquired �secondary meaning.� See <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.,</i> 537
F.2d, at 9 (Friendly, J.). The Lanham Act extended protection to descriptive
marks by making clear that (with certain explicit exceptions not relevant here)</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�nothing ... shall prevent the registration of a mark used
by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in
commerce.� 15 U.S.C. � 1052(f) (1988 ed., Supp. V).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>This language permits an ordinary word, normally used
for a nontrademark purpose ( <i>e.g.,</i> description), to act as a trademark
where it has gained �secondary meaning.� Its logic <a name="sp_780_172"></a><a
name="SDU_172"></a>would appear to apply to color as well. Indeed, in 1985, the
Federal Circuit considered the significance of the Lanham Act's changes as they
related to color and held that trademark protection for color was consistent
with the</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�jurisprudence under the Lanham Act developed in accordance
with the statutory principle that if a mark is capable of being or becoming
distinctive of [the] applicant's goods in commerce, then it is capable of
serving as a trademark.� <i>Owens&#8211;Corning,</i> 774 F.2d, at 1120.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=B101995073454></a>In 1988, Congress amended the
Lanham Act, revising portions of the definitional language, but left unchanged
the language here relevant. � 134, 102 Stat. 3946, 15 U.S.C. � 1127. It enacted
these amendments against the following background: (1) the Federal Circuit had
decided <i>Owens&#8211;Corning;</i> (2) the Patent and Trademark Office had
adopted a clear policy (which it still maintains) permitting registration of
color as a trademark, see PTO Manual � 1202.04(e) (at p. 1200&#8211;12 of the
January 1986 edition and p. 1202&#8211;13 of the May 1993 edition); and (3) the
Trademark Commission had written a report, which recommended that �the terms
�symbol, or device� ... not be deleted or narrowed to preclude registration of
such things as a color, shape, smell, sound, or configuration which functions
as a mark,� The United States Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission
Report and Recommendations to USTA President and Board of Directors, 77
T.M.Rep. 375, 421 (1987); see also 133 Cong.Rec. 32812 (1987) (statement of
Sen. DeConcini) (�The bill I am introducing today is based on the Commission's
report and recommendations�). This background strongly suggests that the
language �any word, name, symbol, or device,� 15 U.S.C. � 1127, had come to
include color. <a name="sp_708_1308"></a><a name="SDU_1308"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*172,_115"></a>And, when it amended the
statute, Congress retained these terms. Indeed, the Senate Report accompanying
the Lanham Act revision explicitly referred to this background understanding,
in saying that the �revised definition intentionally retains ... <a
name="sp_780_173"></a><a name="SDU_173"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*173,_115"></a>the words �symbol or
device� so as not to preclude the registration of colors, shapes, sounds or
configurations where they function as trademarks.� S.Rep. No. 100&#8211;515, at
44 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1988, p. 5607. (In addition, the statute
retained language providing that �[n]o trademark by which the goods of the
applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused
registration ... on account of its nature� (except for certain specified
reasons not relevant here). 15 U.S.C. � 1052 (1988 ed., Supp. V).)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This history undercuts the authority of the
precedent on which Jacobson relies. Much of the pre&#8211;1985 case law rested
on statements in Supreme Court opinions that interpreted pre-Lanham Act
trademark law and were not directly related to the holdings in those cases.
Moreover, we believe the Federal Circuit was right in 1985 when it found that
the 1946 Lanham Act embodied crucial legal changes that liberalized the law to
permit the use of color alone as a trademark (under appropriate circumstances).
At a minimum, the Lanham Act's changes left the courts free to reevaluate the
preexisting legal precedent which had absolutely forbidden the use of color
alone as a trademark. Finally, when Congress reenacted the terms �word, name,
symbol, or device� in 1988, it did so against a legal background in which those
terms had come to include color, and its statutory revision embraced that
understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=B111995073454></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Fourth,</i>
Jacobson argues that there is no need to permit color alone to function as a
trademark because a firm already may use color as part of a trademark, say, as
a colored circle or colored letter or colored word, and may rely upon �trade
dress� protection, under � 43(a) of the Lanham Act, if a competitor copies its
color and thereby causes consumer confusion regarding the overall appearance of
the competing products or their packaging, see 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) (1988 ed.,
Supp. V). The first part of this argument begs the question. One can understand
why a firm might find it difficult to place a usable symbol or word on a product
(say, a large industrial <a name="sp_780_174"></a><a name="SDU_174"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_514_U.S._159,_*174,_115"></a>bolt that customers
normally see from a distance); and, in such instances, a firm might want to use
color, pure and simple, instead of color as part of a design. Neither is the
second portion of the argument convincing. Trademark law helps the holder of a
mark in many ways that �trade dress� protection does not. See 15 U.S.C. � 1124
(ability to prevent importation of confusingly similar goods); � 1072
(constructive notice of ownership); � 1065 (incontestible status); � 1057(b) (prima
facie evidence of validity and ownership). Thus, one can easily find reasons
why the law might provide trademark protection in addition to trade dress
protection.</p>

Jacobson's arguments do not justify a special legal rule preventing color alone

<p class=MsoNormal>Respondent Samara Brothers, Inc., designs and manufactures
children's clothing. Its primary product is a line of spring/summer one-piece
seersucker outfits decorated with appliques of hearts, flowers, fruits, and the
like. A number of chain stores, including JCPenney, sell this line of clothing
under contract with Samara.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Petitioner Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is one of the
Nation's best known retailers, selling among other things children's clothing.
In 1995, Wal-Mart contracted with one of its suppliers, Judy-Philippine, Inc.,
to manufacture a line of children's outfits for sale in the 1996 spring/summer
season. Wal-Mart sent Judy-Philippine photographs of a number of garments from
Samara's line, on which Judy-Philippine's garments were to be based;
Judy-Philippine duly copied, with only minor modifications, 16 of Samara's
garments, many of which contained copyrighted elements. In 1996, Wal-Mart
briskly sold the so-called knockoffs, generating more than $1.15 million in
gross profits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In June 1996, a buyer for JCPenney called a
representative at Samara to complain that she had seen Samara garments on sale
at Wal-Mart for a lower price than JCPenney was allowed to charge under its
contract with Samara. The Samara representative told the buyer that Samara did
not supply its clothing to Wal-Mart. Their suspicions aroused, however, Samara
officials launched an investigation, which disclosed that Wal-Mart and several
other major retailers&#8212;Kmart, Caldor, Hills, and Goody's&#8212;were
selling the knockoffs of Samara's outfits produced by Judy-Philippine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span

brought this action in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against Wal-Mart, Judy-Philippine, Kmart, Caldor, Hills,

unfair competition under New York law, and&#8212;most relevant for our purposes&#8212;infringement

Samara on all of its claims. Wal-Mart then renewed a motion for judgment as a
matter of law, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i> that there was insufficient
evidence to support a conclusion that Samara's clothing designs could be
legally protected as distinctive trade dress for purposes of � 43(a). The
District Court denied the motion, 969 F.Supp. 895 (S.D.N.Y.1997), and awarded
Samara damages, interest, costs, and fees totaling almost $1.6 million,
together with injunctive relief, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 56-58. The Second
Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law, 165

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Lanham Act provides for the registration of
trademarks, which it defines in � 45 to include �any word, name, symbol, or
device, or any combination thereof [used or intended to be used] to identify
and distinguish [a producer's] goods ... from those manufactured or sold by
others and to indicate the source of the goods....� 15 U.S.C. � 1127.
Registration of a mark under � 2 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1052, enables
the owner to sue an infringer under � 32, 15 U.S.C. � 1114; it also entitles
the owner to a presumption that its mark is valid, see � 7(b), 15 U.S.C. � 1057(b),
and ordinarily renders the registered mark incontestable after five years of
continuous use, see � 15, 15 U.S.C. � 1065. In addition to protecting
registered marks, the Lanham Act, in � 43(a), gives a producer a cause of
action for the use by any person of �any word, term, name, symbol, or device,
or any combination thereof ... which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods....� 15 U.S.C. �
1125(a). It is the latter provision that is at issue in this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The breadth of the definition of marks registrable
under � 2, and of the confusion-producing elements recited as actionable by �
43(a), has been held to embrace not just word marks, such as �Nike,� and symbol
marks, such as Nike's �swoosh� symbol, but also �trade dress�&#8212;a category
that originally included only the packaging, or �dressing,� of a product, but
in recent years has been expanded by many Courts of Appeals to encompass the
design of a product. See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. v.
Sangiacomo N. A., Ltd.,</i> 187 F.3d 363 (C.A.4 1999) (bedroom furniture); <i>Knitwaves,
Inc. v. Lollytogs, Ltd.,</i> 71 F.3d 996 (C.A.2 1995) (sweaters); <i>Stuart
Hall Co., Inc. v. Ampad Corp.,</i> 51 F.3d 780 (C.A.8 1995) (notebooks). These
courts have assumed, often without discussion, that trade dress constitutes a
�symbol� or �device� for purposes of the relevant sections, and we conclude
likewise. �Since human beings might use as a �symbol� or �device� almost
anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read
literally, is not restrictive.� <i>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.,</i>
514 U.S. 159, 162 (1995). This reading of � 2 and � 43(a) is buttressed by a
recently added subsection of � 43(a), � 43(a)(3), which refers specifically to
�civil action[s] for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade
dress not registered on the principal register.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(3) (1994
ed., Supp. V).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The text of � 43(a) provides little guidance as to
the circumstances under which unregistered trade dress may be protected. It
does require that a producer show that the allegedly infringing feature is not
�functional,� see � 43(a)(3), and is likely to cause confusion with the product
for which protection is sought, see � 43(a)(1)(A), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(A).
Nothing in � 43(a) explicitly requires a producer to show that its trade dress
is distinctive, but courts have universally imposed that requirement, since
without distinctiveness the trade dress would not �cause confusion ... as to
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of [the] goods,� as the section requires.
Distinctiveness is, moreover, an explicit prerequisite for registration of
trade dress under � 2, and �the general principles qualifying a mark for
registration under � 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in
determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under �
43(a).� <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992)
(citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In evaluating the distinctiveness of a mark under �
2 (and therefore, by analogy, under � 43(a)), courts have held that a mark can be
distinctive in one of two ways. First, a mark is inherently distinctive if
�[its] intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source.� <i>Ibid.</i>
In the context of word marks, courts have applied the now-classic test
originally formulated by Judge Friendly, in which word marks that are
�arbitrary� (�Camel� cigarettes), �fanciful� (�Kodak� film), or �suggestive�
(�Tide� laundry detergent) are held to be inherently distinctive. See <i>Abercrombie
&amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537 F.2d 4, 10-11 (C.A.2 1976).
Second, a mark has acquired distinctiveness, even if it is not inherently
distinctive, if it has developed secondary meaning, which occurs when, �in the
minds of the public, the primary significance of a [mark] is to identify the
source of the product rather than the product itself.� <i>Inwood Laboratories,
Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982).<a
href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The judicial differentiation between marks that are
inherently distinctive and those that have developed secondary meaning has
solid foundation in the statute itself. Section 2 requires that registration be
granted to any trademark �by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished
from the goods of others�&#8212;subject to various limited exceptions. 15
U.S.C. � 1052. It also provides, again with limited exceptions, that �nothing
in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant
which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce�&#8212;that
is, which is not inherently distinctive but has become so only through
secondary meaning. � 2(f), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(f). Nothing in � 2, however,
demands the conclusion that <i>every</i> category of mark necessarily includes
some marks �by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the
goods of others� <i>without</i> secondary meaning&#8212;that in every category
some marks are inherently distinctive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Indeed, with respect to at least one category of mark&#8212;colors&#8212;we
have held that no mark can ever be inherently distinctive. See <i>Qualitex,
supra,</i> at 162-163,. In <i>Qualitex,</i> petitioner manufactured and sold
green-gold dry-cleaning press pads. After respondent began selling pads of a
similar color, petitioner brought suit under � 43(a), then added a claim under
� 32 after obtaining registration for the color of its pads. We held that a
color could be protected as a trademark, but only upon a showing of secondary
meaning. Reasoning by analogy to the <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</i> test
developed for word marks, we noted that a product's color is unlike a
�fanciful,� �arbitrary,� or �suggestive� mark, since it does not �almost <i>automatically</i>
tell a customer that [it] refer[s] to a brand,� 514 U.S., at 162-163, and does
not �immediately ... signal a brand or a product �source,� � <i>id.,</i> at
163. However, we noted that, �over time, customers may come to treat a
particular color on a product or its packaging ... as signifying a brand.� <i>Ibid.</i>
Because a color, like a �descriptive� word mark, could eventually �come to
indicate a product's origin,� we concluded that it could be protected <i>upon a
showing of secondary meaning.</i> <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently
distinctive. The attribution of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories
of word marks and product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose
of attaching a particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive
packaging, is most often to identify the source of the product. Although the
words and packaging can serve subsidiary functions&#8212;a suggestive word mark
(such as �Tide� for laundry detergent), for instance, may invoke positive
connotations in the consumer's mind, and a garish form of packaging (such as
Tide's squat, brightly decorated plastic bottles for its liquid laundry
detergent) may attract an otherwise indifferent consumer's attention on a
crowded store shelf&#8212;their predominant function remains source
identification. Consumers are therefore predisposed to regard those symbols as
indication of the producer, which is why such symbols �almost <i>automatically</i>
tell a customer that they refer to a brand,� <i>id.,</i> at 162-163, and
�immediately ... signal a brand or a product �source,� � <i>id.,</i> at 163.
And where it is not reasonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an
affixed word or packaging as indication of source&#8212;where, for example, the
affixed word is descriptive of the product (�Tasty� bread) or of a geographic
origin (�Georgia� peaches)&#8212;inherent distinctiveness will not be found.
That is why the statute generally excludes, from those word marks that can be
registered as inherently distinctive, words that are �merely descriptive� of
the goods, � 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(e)(1), or �primarily geographically
descriptive of them,� see � 2(e)(2), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(e)(2). In the case of
product design, as in the case of color, we think consumer predisposition to
equate the feature with the source does not exist. Consumers are aware of the
reality that, almost invariably, even the most unusual of product designs&#8212;such
as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin&#8212;is intended not to identify
the source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fact that product design almost invariably
serves purposes other than source identification not only renders inherent
distinctiveness problematic; it also renders application of an
inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful to other consumer interests.
Consumers should not be deprived of the benefits of competition with regard to
the utilitarian and esthetic purposes that product design ordinarily serves by
a rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of suit against new entrants
based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness. How easy it is to mount a
plausible suit depends, of course, upon the clarity of the test for inherent
distinctiveness, and where product design is concerned we have little confidence
that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and the United States
as <i>amicus curiae</i> urge us to adopt for product design relevant portions
of the test formulated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for product
packaging in <i>Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods, Ltd.,</i> 568 F.2d 1342
(1977). That opinion, in determining the inherent distinctiveness of a
product's packaging, considered, among other things, �whether it was a �common�
basic shape or design, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field,
[and] whether it was a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known
form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a
dress or ornamentation for the goods.� <i>Id.,</i> at 1344 (footnotes omitted).
Such a test would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of an
anticompetitive strike suit. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the United
States quite understandably would not give a definitive answer as to whether
the test was met in this very case, saying only that �[t]his is a very
difficult case for that purpose.� Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is true, of course, that the person seeking to
exclude new entrants would have to establish the nonfunctionality of the design
feature, see � 43(a)(3), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)&#8212;a
showing that may involve consideration of its esthetic appeal, see <i>Qualitex,
supra,</i> at 170, 115 S.Ct. 1300. Competition is deterred, however, not merely
by successful suit but by the plausible threat of successful suit, and given
the unlikelihood of inherently source-identifying design, the game of allowing
suit based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness seems to us not worth the
candle. That is especially so since the producer can ordinarily obtain
protection for a design that <i>is</i> inherently source identifying (if any
such exists), but that does not yet have secondary meaning, by securing a
design patent or a copyright for the design&#8212;as, indeed, respondent did for
certain elements of the designs in this case. The availability of these other
protections greatly reduces any harm to the producer that might ensue from our
conclusion that a product design cannot be protected under � 43(a) without a
showing of secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Respondent contends that our decision in <i>Two
Pesos</i> forecloses a conclusion that product-design trade dress can never be
inherently distinctive. In that case, we held that the trade dress of a chain
of Mexican restaurants, which the plaintiff described as �a festive eating
atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts,
bright colors, paintings and murals,� 505 U.S., at 765 (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted), could be protected under � 43(a) without a showing
of secondary meaning, see <i>id.,</i> at 776. <i>Two Pesos</i> unquestionably
establishes the legal principle that trade dress can be inherently distinctive,
see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>id.,</i> at 773, 112 S.Ct. 2753, but it does not establish
that <i>product-design</i> trade dress can be. <i>Two Pesos</i> is inapposite
to our holding here because the trade dress at issue, the decor of a
restaurant, seems to us not to constitute product <i>design.</i> It was either
product packaging&#8212;which, as we have discussed, normally <i>is</i> taken
by the consumer to indicate origin&#8212;or else some <i>tertium quid</i> that
is akin to product packaging and has no bearing on the present case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Respondent replies that this manner of
distinguishing <i>Two Pesos</i> will force courts to draw difficult lines
between product-design and product-packaging trade dress. There will indeed be
some hard cases at the margin: a classic glass Coca-Cola bottle, for instance,
may constitute packaging for those consumers who drink the Coke and then
discard the bottle, but may constitute the product itself for those consumers
who are bottle collectors, or part of the product itself for those consumers
who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle, rather than a can, because they think
it more stylish to drink from the former. We believe, however, that the
frequency and the difficulty of having to distinguish between product design
and product packaging will be much less than the frequency and the difficulty
of having to decide when a product design is inherently distinctive. To the
extent there are close cases, we believe that courts should err on the side of
caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design, thereby requiring
secondary meaning. The very closeness will suggest the existence of relatively
small utility in adopting an inherent-distinctiveness principle, and relatively
great consumer benefit in requiring a demonstration of secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We hold that, in an action for infringement of
unregistered trade dress under � 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's design is
distinctive, and therefore protectible, only upon a showing of secondary
meaning. The judgment of the Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>441 F.3d 957 (Fed. Cir. 2006)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Joanne Slokevage (�Slokevage�) appeals from the
decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Trial and
Appeal Board (�Board�) sustaining the refusal of the examiner to register her
trade dress mark for clothing. <i>In re Joanne Slokevage,</i> Serial No.
75602873 (TTAB Nov. 10, 2004) (�<i>Final Decision</i>�). Because the Board's
finding that Slokevage's trade dress was product design and thus could not be
inherently distinctive, and that the trade dress was not unitary are supported
by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Slokevage filed an application to register a mark
on the Principal Register for �pants, overalls, shorts, culottes, dresses,
skirts.� Slokevage described the mark in her application as a �configuration�
that consists of a label with the words �FLASH DARE!� in a V-shaped background,
and cut-out areas located on each side of the label. The cut-out areas consist
of a hole in a garment and a flap attached to the garment with a closure
device. This trade dress configuration, which is located on the rear of various
garments, is depicted below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:black'><img border=0 width=161 height=127 id="Picture 13"
src="BeebeTMLaw-PartI-v1.0_files/image024.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although Slokevage currently seeks to register a mark
for the overall configuration of her design, she has already received
protection for various aspects of the trade dress configuration. For example,
she received a design patent for the cut-out area design. She also registered
on the Supplemental Register<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[64]</span></span></span></a>
a design mark for the cut-out area. In addition, she registered the word mark
�FLASH DARE!� on the Principal Register.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The trademark examiner initially refused
registration of the proposed mark on the ground that it constituted a clothing
configuration that is not inherently distinctive. The examiner afforded
Slokevage the opportunity to submit evidence of acquired distinctiveness or to
disclaim the design elements of the configuration, but Slokevage chose not to
submit evidence of acquired distinctiveness or to disclaim the design elements.
Rather, she argued that the trade dress was inherently distinctive. The
examiner, relying on section 2(f) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1052(f),
made final his refusal to register the mark on the ground that the clothing
configuration constitutes �product design/configuration,� and pursuant to the
decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara
Brothers, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 205, 120 S.Ct. 1339, 146 L.Ed.2d 182 (2000),
�product design� cannot be inherently distinctive. The examiner noted that
Slokevage's reference in her application to the trade dress as a �cut-away flap
design� supported a determination that the configuration constitutes product
design....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Slokevage appealed the refusal of the examiner to
register the trade dress configuration, and the Board affirmed the examiner's
decision. The Board found that the cut-out areas, consisting of the holes and
flaps, constituted product design. Relying on <i>Wal-Mart,</i> the Board
observed that a product design �will not be regarded as a source indicator at
the time of its introduction.� According to the Board, Slokevage's trade dress,
as product design, could not be inherently distinctive, and therefore could not
be registered absent a showing of acquired distinctiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We apply a limited standard of review to Board decisions,
reviewing legal determinations <i>de novo</i> and factual findings for
substantial evidence. <i>In re Pacer Tech.,</i> 338 F.3d 1348, 1349
(Fed.Cir.2003). �Substantial evidence requires the reviewing court to ask
whether a reasonable person might find that the evidentiary record supports the
agency's conclusion.� <i>On-Line Careline, Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc.,</i> 229
F.3d 1080, 1085 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a preliminary matter, Slokevage argues that
whether trade dress is product design or not is a legal determination, whereas
the government asserts that it is a factual issue. The resolution of that
question is an issue of first impression for this court. We conclude that the
determination whether trade dress is product design is a factual finding
because it is akin to determining whether a trademark is inherently distinctive
or whether a mark is descriptive, which are questions of fact. <i>See, e.g.,
Hoover Co. v. Royal Appliance Mfg. Co.,</i> 238 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed.Cir.2001)
(�The issue of inherent distinctiveness is a factual determination made by the
board�); <i>see also In re Nett Designs, Inc.,</i> 236 F.3d 1339, 1341
(Fed.Cir.2001) (�Placement of a term on the
fanciful-suggestive-descriptive-generic continuum is a question of fact�).
Inherent distinctiveness or descriptiveness involves consumer perception and
whether consumers are predisposed towards equating a symbol with a source. <i>See
In re MBNA Am. Bank, N.A.,</i> 340 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2003); <i>In re
Nett Designs, Inc.,</i> 236 F.3d at 1341-42. Such issues are determined based
on testimony, surveys, and other evidence as questions of fact. Determining
whether trade dress is product design or product packaging involves a similar
inquiry. <i>Wal-Mart,</i> 529 U.S. at 213, 120 S.Ct. 1339 (discussing product
packaging and design in the context of consumers ability to equate the product
with the source). We therefore will defer to the Board's finding on product
design, affirming the Board if its decision is supported by substantial evidence�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On appeal, Slokevage argues that the Board erred in
determining that the trade dress<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[65]</span></span></span></a>
for which she seeks protection is product design and thus that it cannot be
inherently distinctive. She asserts that the Board's reliance on the Supreme
Court's decision in <i>Wal-Mart</i> to support its position that Slokevage's
trade dress is product design is misplaced. In particular, she contends that <i>Wal-Mart</i>
does not provide guidance on how to determine whether trade dress is product
design. Moreover, she maintains that the trade dress at issue in <i>Wal-Mart,</i>
which was classified as product design without explanation, is different from
Slokevage's trade dress because the <i>Wal-Mart</i> trade dress implicated the
overall appearance of the product and was a theme made up of many unique
elements. Slokevage argues that her trade dress, in contrast, involves one
component of a product design, which can be used with a variety of types of clothing.
Slokevage further asserts that her trade dress is located on the rear hips of
garments, which is a location that consumers frequently recognize as
identifying the source of the garment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The PTO responds that the Board correctly concluded
that Slokevage's trade dress is product design and that it properly relied on <i>Wal-Mart</i>
for support of its determination. According to the PTO, in the <i>Wal-Mart</i>
decision the Supreme Court determined that a design of clothing is product
design. The PTO further asserts that the trade dress at issue in <i>Wal-Mart,</i>
which was classified as product design, is similar to Slokevage's trade dress.
The trade dress in <i>Wal-Mart</i> consists of design elements on a line of
garments, and Slokevage's trade dress similarly consists of a design component
common to the overall design of a variety of garments. The PTO notes that
Slokevage's trade dress application refers to her trade dress as a
�configuration� including a �clothing feature,� and that �product
configuration� is synonymous with �product design.� The PTO also argues that
under <i>Wal-Mart</i> product design cannot be inherently distinctive, the
rationale being that consumers perceive product design as making the product
more useful or desirable, rather than indicating source. According to the PTO,
the trade dress at issue here makes the product more desirable to consumers,
rather than indicates source. Finally, the PTO notes that even if it were a
close case as to whether Slokevage's trade dress constitutes product design,
the Court's opinion in <i>Wal-Mart</i> states that in �close cases,� trade
dress should be categorized as product design, thereby requiring proof of
acquired distinctiveness for protection. 529 U.S. at 215.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the Board that Slokevage's trade
dress constitutes product design and therefore cannot be inherently
distinctive. The Lanham Act provides protection not only for words and symbols,
but also for �trade dress,� a category of trademarks that has been described as
involving the �total image of a product,� including �features such as size,
shape, color or color combinations, texture, graphics, or even particular sales
techniques.� <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 764 n.
1 (1992). The Supreme Court has recently observed that trade dress is a
category that originally included only the packaging of a product, but has been
expanded by courts to encompass the design of a product. <i>Wal-Mart,</i> 529
U.S. at 209. In order for an applicant to gain protection for trade dress, the
trade dress must be distinctive, either inherently or by acquiring
distinctiveness. <i>Two-Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753. Trade dress
is inherently distinctive when its �intrinsic nature serves to identify a
particular source of a product,� and, in contrast, acquires distinctiveness
when the public comes to associate the product with its source. <i>Id.</i> at
768-769. The Supreme Court has determined that certain types of trade dress, in
particular, product design and color, can never be inherently distinctive. <i>See
Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co.,</i> 514 U.S. 159, 162 (1995) (color can
never be inherently distinctive); <i>Wal-Mart,</i> 529 U.S. at 212 (product
design is not inherently distinctive).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Directly relevant to our discussion of product
design is the Court's discussion in <i>Wal-Mart.</i> That case addressed
whether product design could ever be inherently distinctive and answered the
question in the negative. The trade dress in <i>Wal-Mart</i> involved
children's clothing decorated with �hearts, flowers, fruits, and the like.� 529
U.S. at 207. The Court labeled that trade dress product design and ultimately
concluded that product design is entitled to protection only if it has acquired
distinctiveness. <i>Id.</i> at 216. The Court reasoned that �in the case of
product design ... we think consumer predisposition to equate the feature with
the source does not exist� and stated that �even the most unusual of product
designs&#8212;such as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin&#8212;is intended
not to identify the source, but to render the product itself more useful or
more appealing.� <i>Id.</i> at 213. Thus, the Court established a bright-line
rule&#8212;product design cannot be inherently distinctive, and always requires
proof of acquired distinctiveness to be protected. The Court did not recite the
factors that distinguish between product packaging and product design trade
dress, but stated that in �close cases� courts should classify the trade dress
as product design. <i>Id.</i> at 215.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both parties agree that if we determine that the
trade dress at issue is product design, then it cannot be inherently distinctive
under the decision in <i>Wal-Mart.</i> The issue pertinent to this appeal,
however, is whether Slokevage's proposed trade dress is product design.
Although the decision in <i>Wal-Mart</i> does not expressly address the issue
of what constitutes product design, it is informative to this case because it
provides examples of trade dress that are product design. The Court observed
that a �cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin� is product design and that the
trade dress at issue in that case, �a line of spring/summer one-piece
seersucker outfits decorated with appliques of hearts, flowers, fruits, and the
like� is product design. <i>Wal-Mart,</i> 529 U.S. at 207. These examples
demonstrate that product design can consist of design features incorporated
into a product. Slokevage urges that her trade dress is not product design
because it does not alter the entire product but is more akin to a label being
placed on a garment. We do not agree. The holes and flaps portion are part of
the design of the clothing&#8212;the cut-out area is not merely a design placed
on top of a garment, but is a design incorporated into the garment itself.
Moreover, while Slokevage urges that product design trade dress must implicate
the entire product, we do not find support for that proposition. Just as the
product design in <i>Wal-Mart</i> consisted of certain design features featured
on clothing, Slokevage's trade dress similarly consists of design features,
holes and flaps, featured in clothing, revealing the similarity between the two
types of design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition, the reasoning behind the Supreme
Court's determination that product design cannot be inherently distinctive is
also instructive to our case. The Court reasoned that, unlike a trademark whose
�predominant function� remains source identification, product design often
serves other functions, such as rendering the �product itself more useful or
more appealing.� <i>Wal-Mart,</i> 529 U.S. at 212, 213. The design at issue
here can serve such utilitarian and aesthetic functions. For example, consumers
may purchase Slokevage's clothing for the utilitarian purpose of wearing a
garment or because they find the appearance of the garment particularly
desirable. Consistent with the Supreme Court's analysis in <i>Wal-Mart,</i> in
such cases when the purchase implicates a utilitarian or aesthetic purpose,
rather than a source-identifying function, it is appropriate to require proof
of acquired distinctiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, the Court in <i>Wal-Mart</i> provided
guidance on how to address trade dress cases that may be difficult to classify:
�To the extent that there are close cases, we believe that courts should err on
the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design,
thereby requiring secondary meaning.� 529 U.S. at 215. Even if this were a
close case, therefore, we must follow that precedent and classify the trade
dress as product design. We thus agree with the Board that Slokevage's trade
dress is product design and therefore that she must prove acquired
distinctiveness in order for her trade dress mark to be registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>McKernan</i>, the plaintiff McKernan sold a novelty
bumper sticker that purported to be a �Cape Cod Canal Tunnel Permit.� He
brought a trademark infringement suit against Burek and others who were producing
similar bumper stickers.&nbsp; McKernan conceded that his bumper sticker design
had no secondary meaning.&nbsp; The parties filed cross-motions for summary
judgment.&nbsp; Judge Lasker analyzed whether the bumper sticker was product
packaging or product configuration as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>The Tunnel Permit presents one of the �hard cases at
the margin� referred to by the Supreme Court [in <i>Wal-Mart.</i>]. It is
particularly difficult to try to distinguish between the packaging and the
product when discussing an ornamental bumper sticker. The packaging and the
product are so intertwined that distinguishing between them may be regarded as
a scholastic endeavor.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent><a name="sp_4637_124"></a><a name="SDU_124"></a><a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_118_F.Supp.2d_119,_*124"></a>Nevertheless, the Supreme
Court's opinion in <i>Wal&#8211;Mart</i> provides some guidance. The example
given in <i>Wal&#8211;Mart,</i> of the classic Coca&#8211;Cola bottle is
instructive: an item is the product if it is the essential commodity being
purchased and consumed rather than the dress which presents the product.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Here, the essential commodity being purchased is a
joke on a bumper sticker. All of the visual elements contained in the Tunnel
Permit are a part of this joke and indispensable to it. What is being purchased
and consumed is the novelty sticker, not dress identifying the prestige or
standing of its source. Because McKernan is seeking protection for the product
being consumed, the proper classification of what McKernan seeks to protect is
product design. This view of the matter is strengthened by the <i>Wal&#8211;Mart</i>
Court's remarkably clear advice that in close cases trial courts should �err on
the side of caution and classify ambiguous trade dress as product design.� <i>Wal&#8211;Mart,</i>
529 U.S. at 215.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Accordingly, because McKernan seeks to protect his
product design which, by definition, cannot be �inherently distinctive,� his

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Best Cellars</i>, the plaintiff, a wine retailer based
in New York City, broadly claimed as its trade dress</p>

<p class=Blockquote>the total effect of the interior design of its store, which
it describes as: (1) eight words differentiating taste categories; (2) eight
colors differentiating taste categories; (3) eight computer manipulated images
differentiating taste categories; (4) taste categories set above display
fixtures by order of weight; (5) single display bottles set on stainless-steel
wire pedestals; (6) square 4&quot;x4&quot; cards with verbal descriptions of
each wine (�shelf talkers�) with text arranged by template; (7) shelf talkers
positioned at eye level, below each display bottle; (8) bottles vertically
aligned in rows of nine; (9) storage cabinets located beneath vertically
aligned bottled; (10) materials palette consisting of light wood and stainless
steel; (11) mixture of vertical racks and open shelving display fixtures; (12)
no fixed aisles; (13) bottles down and back-lit; and (14) limited selection
(approximately 100) of relatively inexpensive wine.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 70.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judge Lynch briefly analyzed whether this constituted
product packaging trade dress or product configuration trade dress as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Unlike more traditional trade dress cases that concern
product packaging (like water bottles, <i>see</i> <i>Nora Beverages, Inc. v.
Perrier Group of America, Inc.,</i> 269 F.3d 114 (2d Cir.2001)) or product
designs (like children's clothing, <i>see</i> <i>Samara Bros.,</i> 529 U.S. at
213), this case concerns the interior decor of a retail establishment where
customers purchase other products. In this, the case is similar to <i>Two
Pesos,</i> which concerned the interior decor of Mexican-themed restaurants. <i>See</i>
<i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 764&#8211;65 n. 1 (noting that trade dress �may
include features such as size, shape, color or color combinations, texture,
graphics, or even particular sales techniques� (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted)). As the Supreme Court explained, the interior decor category
fits awkwardly into the classifications of trade dress law, constituting either
product packaging or a <i>�tertium quid�</i> akin to product packaging. <i>Samara
Bros.,</i> 529 U.S. at 215. Interior decor is thus clearly <i>not</i> product
design. Accordingly, it is appropriate to analyze the Best Cellars' interior
decor trade dress under the product packaging standard for inherent
distinctiveness�.</p>

analyzed the question of product packaging / product configuration as follows: </p>

whether the subject trade dress&#8212;the undulating curve on the decorative

that the curve is part of the product design, and that, therefore, evidence of
secondary meaning is required. On the other hand, Fedders notes that the curve
is not functional, but rather, purely esthetic. Moreover, Fedders argues that
the curve is a unique design that is associated with its Chassis line of air
conditioners. Therefore, according to Fedders, the curve is �inherently
distinctive,� and no evidence of secondary meaning is necessary�.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>In this case, the Court believes
that Fedders's undulating curve is not �packaging�, but rather product design.
The curve serves a purpose other than to identify the maker. It serves the

<h4><a name="_Toc392009932"><a name="_Toc365129323">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing
the Inherent Distinctiveness of </a>Product Packaging Trade Dress</a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Product configuration trade dress and single colors (whether
applied to the packaging of the product or the product itself) are per se
incapable of inherent distinctiveness, and it is likely that courts would also
find smells, tastes, and textures also to be incapable of inherent
distinctiveness.&nbsp; But this leaves a wide array of nonverbal marks,
including product packaging trade dress, that remain capable of inherent
distinctiveness.&nbsp; The question, then, is how to determine whether a
particular mark that falls into one of these categories is in fact inherently
distinctive.&nbsp; While the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum works reasonably well
for verbal marks, it is not clear that it is well-suited to the inherent
distinctiveness analysis of nonverbal marks.&nbsp; Instead, as we will see in
the <i>Amazing Spaces</i> opinion below, most courts have adopted the so-called
<i>Seabrook</i> factors, from <i>Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar&#8211;Well Foods
Ltd</i>., 568 F.2d 1342 (CPPA 1977), to analyze the inherent distinctiveness of
nonverbal marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Seabrook</i>, the plaintiff Seabrook had registered,
for frozen vegetables, a mark consisting in part of a pointed loop (or
�stylized leaf design�, as Seabrook called it) as shown below.&nbsp; Seabrook
opposed the registration of Bar-Well�s mark, also for frozen foods, that
incorporated a similar pointed loop design on the ground that Bar-Well�s use of
the mark would confuse consumers.&nbsp; The Court of Customs &amp; Patent
Appeals (the predecessor court to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit)
set forth various factors relevant to the question of whether consumers would
perceive the pointed loop design (absent the words and image of a farm) as
inherently distinctive of source:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In determining whether a design is arbitrary or distinctive
this court has looked to whether it was a �common� basic shape or design, whether
it was unique or unusual in a particular field, &nbsp;whether it was a mere
refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a
particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress or ornamentation for
the goods, or whether it was capable of creating a commercial impression
distinct from the accompanying words.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1344.&nbsp; The CCPA ultimately
determined that the design at issue would be perceived merely as decoration.&nbsp;
<i>Id</i>.&nbsp; These factors soon came to inform most courts analysis of the
inherent distinctiveness of all nonverbal trademarks (including, before <i>Samara
Bros</i>., product configuration trade dress).&nbsp; </p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed below in <i>Amazing Spaces</i> and as shown in <i>Fun-Damental
Too, Ltd. v. Gemmy Industries Corp</i>., 111 F.3d 993 (2d Cir. 1997), the
Second Circuit has not explicitly adopted the <i>Seabrook</i> factors and
continues to try to apply <i>Abercrombie</i> to the analysis of the
distinctiveness of nonverbal marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the two leading treatises on trademark law
disagree on which test works better.&nbsp; McCarthy strongly endorses <i>Seabrook</i>:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the author's view, the <i>Seabrook</i> test is by far
the preferable test to classify inherently distinctive trade dress in packaging
and containers. Necessarily focusing upon the probable reaction of the ordinary
consumer, it focuses upon the key issue in these cases: is the design so
different in this market that it will immediately be perceived as a source
identifier, not merely or solely as an attractive decoration or embellishment.
The <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum was developed specifically for word marks and
does not translate into the world of shapes and designs.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
�8:13.&nbsp; The Gilson treatise remain loyal to <i>Abercrombie</i>:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The <i>Abercrombie</i> classifications are not an ideal fit
for product packaging trade dress cases; is a squeeze bottle with a top that
squirts liquid suggestive of dish soap or spring water or is it generic for
those products because it is so widely used? Nevertheless, pending further
clarification from the Supreme Court, lower courts should continue to use the <i>Abercrombie</i>
spectrum in classifying product packaging trade dress.�).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Gilson</span>
�2A.03[1][a][ii].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note further that if a court finds a feature of product
packaging to lack both inherent and acquired distinctiveness or a feature of
product configuration to lack acquired distinctiveness, then the court will
often (but not always) deem the feature to be �mere ornamentation.�&nbsp; For
example, in <i>In re Lululemon Athletica Canada, Inc</i>., 105 U.S.P.Q.2d 1684
(TTAB 2013), the TTAB analyzed the wave design for apparel shown below.&nbsp;
The TTAB did not apparently consider the design to be product configuration
(and thus per se incapable of inherent distinctiveness).&nbsp; It nevertheless
found that the design lacked inherent distinctiveness and acquired
distinctiveness and would be perceived by consumers as mere ornamentation. </p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff's product is displayed in stores in a
royal blue triangular-shaped box. The Toilet Bank itself is visible within the
open-style box, which allows a consumer access to the toilet handle so that the
flushing sound may be tested. The toy's bowl is covered with a clear plastic
cover that includes a raised three-dimensional circle to which is affixed a
gray sticker depicting a coin. The bank is held in place in its box by a 1/4
inch strap running up one side of the toilet bowl, through the plastic cover,
and down the other side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span

rear panel is decorated with the product name and two pictures demonstrating
how to use the product. The top picture shows a hand holding a coin over the
toilet bowl, and the bottom one shows an index finger depressing the handle
with the message �REAL FLUSHING SOUND� in white letters on a red bubble. In the
upper right hand corner of this panel is a yellow starburst with the words
�REAL FLUSHING SOUND� in red letters. Below it is a yellow arrow pointing down
toward the handle with the legend in red: �TRY ME� and in smaller letters:
�PRESS HANDLE.� The same message appears on a red arrow sticker, affixed to the
toilet tank, pointing diagonally towards the silver handle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We ordinarily evaluate inherent distinctiveness of
trade dress by applying the trademark classifications as set forth by Judge
Friendly in <i>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537 F.2d
4, 9 (2d Cir.1976). <i>See Paddington Corp. v. Attiki Importers &amp; Distrib.,
Inc.,</i> 996 F.2d 577, 583 (2d Cir.1993) (adopting Judge Friendly's test to
evaluate the inherent distinctiveness of product packaging). Within this
framework, trade dress is classified on a spectrum of increasing
distinctiveness as generic, descriptive, suggestive, or arbitrary/fanciful�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Supreme Court has emphasized that an inherently
distinctive trade dress is one whose �intrinsic nature serves to identify a
particular source of a product,� <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc</i>.,
505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992)<i>,</i> although it may not yet have widespread
identification among consumers. <i>Id.</i> at 771. Consumers generally rely on
packaging for information about the product and its source. But the varieties
of labels and packaging available to wholesalers and manufacturers are
virtually unlimited. As a consequence, a product's trade dress typically will
be arbitrary or fanciful and meet the inherently distinctive requirement for �
43(a) protection. <i>Mana Prods., Inc. v. Columbia Cosmetics Mfg., Inc.,</i> 65
F.3d 1063, 1069 (2d Cir.1995); <i>Chevron Chem. Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing
Groups, Inc.,</i> 659 F.2d 695, 703 (5th Cir.1981).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Yet trade dress protection has limits. A trade
dress that consists of the shape of a product that conforms to a well-established
industry custom is generic and hence unprotected. For example, the cosmetics
industry's common use of black, rectangular-shaped compacts renders that
packaging generic. <i>Mana,</i> 65 F.3d at 1070; <i>see also Paddington,</i>
996 F.2d at 583 (soda industry practice would render green cans generic for the
purpose of packaging lime-flavored soda). In short, despite the broad
opportunity to design an arbitrary or fanciful trade dress, a specific trade
dress must still be evaluated to determine whether it is so distinctive as to
point to a single source of origin and thereby be entitled to Lanham Act
protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants urge us to adopt a more stringent
standard of distinctiveness than that used by the trial court. Recently we
declined to use the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum of distinctiveness in a trade
dress case that involved features of the product itself. <i>Knitwaves, Inc. v.
Lollytogs Ltd.,</i> 71 F.3d 996 (2d Cir.1995). In an attempt to extend that
rationale, defendants suggest we adopt an alternative test for inherent
distinctiveness of trade dress set forth in <i>Seabrook Foods, Inc. v.
Bar&#8211;Well Foods Ltd.,</i> 568 F.2d 1342, 1344 (C.C.P.A.1977). Under <i>Seabrook,</i>
the inquiry is whether the design or shape of a package is a common, basic one,
or whether it is unique or unusual in a particular field; whether the design is
a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known form of ornamentation
for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a trade dress or
ornamentation for such goods, or whether it is one capable of creating a
commercial impression separate from the accompanying words. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We see no reason to abandon the <i>Abercrombie</i>
distinctiveness spectrum in this case. Several reasons lead us to decline.
First, we have expressly ruled that the <i>Abercrombie</i> classifications
apply to packaging. <i>Paddington,</i> 996 F.2d at 583. Second, <i>Knitwaves</i>
is a pure product configuration case, separate from product packaging, the
category of trade dress at issue in this case. In <i>Knitwaves,</i> the trade
dress lay in the product itself, rather than in a symbol&#8212;a trademark or
packaging&#8212;associated with the product. It was therefore difficult to
define some aspect or feature of the trade dress as �descriptive� or
�arbitrary� in relation to the product. <i>See Knitwaves,</i> 71 F.3d at
1007&#8211;08 (quoting <i>Duraco Prods. v. Joy Plastic Enters., Ltd.,</i> 40
F.3d 1431, 1440&#8211;41 (3d Cir.1994)). In contrast, a store display of a
product's packaging style creates an image of the product more readily
separated from the product itself. Moreover, although there may be a finite set
of ways to configure a product, the variety of packaging available for a given
product is limited only by the bounds of imagination. These factors render
packaging more suitable than product configuration for classification under the
<i>Abercrombie</i> system as arbitrary or fanciful, suggestive, descriptive, or
generic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Third, use of the <i>Abercrombie</i> test tracks
the purpose of the Lanham Act to identify source. That is, it is consistent
with the Supreme Court's emphasis on a trade dress' capacity to �identify a
particular source of the product.� <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 771. While a
more stringent test is necessary in the product configuration context, applying
<i>Abercrombie</i> to product packaging serves the aims of the Lanham Act
because consumers are more likely to rely on the packaging of a product than on
the product's design as an indication of source. Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition � 16 cmt. b (1995). In contrast, over-inclusive protection of the
product design risks conferring benefits beyond the intended scope of the
Lanham Act and entering what is properly the realm of patent law. <i>See
Fabrication Enters., Inc. v. Hygenic Corp.,</i> 64 F.3d 53, 59 n. 4 (2d
Cir.1995). Thus, though the <i>Abercrombie</i> classifications were originally
developed for analysis of word marks, we conclude that because of the endless
number of product packaging options the <i>Abercrombie</i> test is
appropriately applied in this trade dress case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B. <i>Distinctiveness in the Instant Case</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants insist that the Toilet Bank's trade
dress is not inherently distinctive, principally because the elements
identified as part of that characterization are generic. Classification under
the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum of distinctiveness is a question of fact
reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <i>See Bristol&#8211;Myers
Squibb Co. v. McNeil&#8211;P.P.C., Inc.,</i> 973 F.2d 1033, 1039&#8211;40 (2d
Cir.1992) (classification of trademarks). We evaluate trade dress
distinctiveness by looking at all its elements and considering the total
impression the trade dress gives to the observer. <i>Paddington,</i> 996 F.2d
at 584. Concededly, a number of individual features of the Toilet Bank's trade
dress are common in the toy industry; for example, the triangular shape of the
box and its open styling are found everywhere on toy store shelves. The red
arrows stating �Try Me,� the starburst (separate from the notation �flushing
sound�), and the raised blister are similarly quite usual legends in the toy
business. Although some of the individual elements of a trade dress are generic
or descriptive, the impression given by all of them in combination may be
inherently distinctive. Such was what the district court found here; and we
cannot say that this finding is clearly erroneous.</p>

making the inherently distinctive determination regarding the Toilet Bank's
trade dress. We disagree. Although Fun&#8211;Damental makes no claim regarding
the copying of its product, it was appropriate to consider the packaging in
conjunction with the product, rather than simply the empty box. �[T]rade dress
today encompasses a broad concept of how a product presented to the public
looks, including its color, design, container, and all the elements that make
up its total appearance.� <i>Mana,</i> 65 F.3d at 1069.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This �total look� approach is the only workable way
to consider such elements of the trade dress as the arrow sticker that is
affixed to the Toilet Bank's tank. Because the box is open in order to display
the product, it was proper to analyze Fun&#8211;Damental's trade dress as seen
by consumers&#8212;including the Toilet Bank product. Further, there is no risk
of �spillover� protection for the Toilet Bank as a product here since the
injunction is limited to the sale of a similar product in a <i>particular</i>
package, rather than an absolute ban on the sale of the Currency Can in an
open-style box. In sum, we conclude that looking at the product itself in the
context of its packaging is a proper method of analyzing open-style packaging
for trade dress protection.</p>

<i>Wal&#8211;Mart Stores,</i> 529 U.S. at 210 (quoting <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505

disagree over not only the answer to whether the Star Symbol is inherently
distinctive but also over the proper method for conducting the inquiry. Metro
urges that the familiar <i>Abercrombie</i> test cannot be used to categorize
the Star Symbol and instead asks that we apply the <i>Seabrook Foods</i> test
to determine that the Star Symbol is not inherently distinctive. Amazing
Spaces, by contrast, presses the application of the <i>Abercrombie </i>test,
under which it claims the Star Symbol is inherently distinctive, and it argues alternatively
that the Star Symbol is inherently distinctive under the <i>Seabrook Foods</i>
test.</p>

categorization under the <i>Abercrombie</i> test, and we consequently do not
rely on a rote application of its categories in determining whether the Star
Symbol is inherently distinctive. The Supreme Court's most recent recitation of
the <i>Abercrombie</i> categories noted its use only in the context of marks
consisting of words. <i>See Wal&#8211;Mart Stores,</i> 529 U.S. at 210 (�<i>In
the context of word marks,</i> courts have applied the now-classic test
originally formulated by Judge Friendly ....� (emphasis added) (citing <i>Abercrombie,</i>
537 F.2d at 10&#8211;11)). The Court's precedent also supports the proposition
that some marks, although deserving of legal protection, do not fit within the <i>Abercrombie</i>
spectrum. In <i>Qualitex,</i> the Court declined to apply the <i>Abercrombie</i>
test to a mark consisting purely of a shade of color used in a product's trade
dress, holding that the mark could constitute a legally protectable mark only
through a showing of secondary meaning. 514 U.S. at 162&#8211;63. The Court
further extended that logic when, in <i>Wal&#8211;Mart Stores,</i> it stated
that �[i]t seems to us that [product] design, like color, is not inherently
distinctive� and held that marks consisting of a product's design were
protectable only upon proof of secondary meaning&#8212;a conclusion it could
not have reached had it applied the <i>Abercrombie</i> test. <i>Wal&#8211;Mart
Stores,</i> 529 U.S. at 212. Professor McCarthy, a luminary in the field of trademark
law, has likewise suggested that the <i>Abercrombie</i> test may not apply to
all marks, stating that �[u]se of the spectrum of descriptive, suggestive,
arbitrary and fanciful is largely confined to word marks. It is usually not
suitable for nonword designations such as shapes and images ... [, which] must
be judged by other guidelines.� 2 MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS � 11:2, at 11&#8211;7.
The RESTATEMENT, in a section addressed to symbols, graphic designs, and
colors, agrees:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A symbol or graphic design is not inherently distinctive
unless the nature of the designation and the manner of its use make it likely
that prospective purchasers will perceive the designation as an indication of
source. Commonplace symbols and designs are not inherently distinctive since their
appearance on numerous products makes it unlikely that consumers will view them
as distinctive of the goods or services of a particular seller. Thus, unless
the symbol or design is striking, unusual, or otherwise likely to differentiate
the products of a particular producer, the designation is not inherently
distinctive.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>RESTATEMENT � 13 cmt. d, at 107.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the district court discovered, the challenge of
placing the Star Symbol into <i>Abercrombie</i>'s constellation of categories
is a futile endeavor. We have described the <i>Abercrombie</i> categories as
follows�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;The district court briefly probed the utility
of applying the <i>Abercrombie</i> test and concluded that the Star Symbol did
not fit as a generic, descriptive, or suggestive mark. <i>See Amazing Spaces,</i>
665 F.Supp.2d at 737. The district court first rejected the notion that the
Star Symbol was generic because �[a] five-pointed star within a circle does not
refer to a product or service provided by a self-storage company� and �[t]he
evidence of widespread use of a five-point star or a five-point star set within
a circle by many diverse businesses and government offices supports the
conclusion that the star mark is not related to or a generic symbol for
self-storage goods or services.� <i>Id.</i> It next determined that the Star
Symbol was not descriptive because �[i]t does not identify a characteristic or
quality of self-storage service, such as its function or quality.� <i>Id.</i>
Nor was the Star Symbol suggestive, according to the district court, because
�[t]here is no basis to conclude that a five-pointed star set within a circle
suggests an attribute of self-storage services.� <i>Id.</i> We discern no flaws
in the district court's analysis with respect to these three categories.
However, the logical extension of the district court's analysis is the
conclusion that the Star Symbol is arbitrary or fanciful, which under the <i>Abercrombie</i>
test would render it inherently distinctive and thus entitled to protection.
Yet the district court refused to so conclude, stating that �the star mark
cannot be classified as arbitrary or fanciful unless it is inherently
distinctive so as to serve as a source identifier for Amazing Spaces.� <i>Id.</i>
It then turned to the <i>Seabrook Foods</i> test in conducting its inquiry into
the Star Symbol's inherent distinctiveness. <i>See id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree that the Star Symbol&#8212;indeed, any
mark&#8212;lacks inherent distinctiveness if its intrinsic nature does not
serve to identify its source. <i>See Wal&#8211;Mart Stores,</i> 529 U.S. at 210
(�[A] mark is inherently distinctive if �its intrinsic nature serves to
identify a particular source.� � (quoting <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 768)).
Furthermore, as we have already indicated, we approve the district court's
decision to apply a test other than <i>Abercrombie</i> in this case. However,
we disagree somewhat with the district court's reasoning that a mark cannot be
categorized as arbitrary or fanciful unless it is inherently distinctive. Under
the <i>Abercrombie</i> test, it is the categorization of a mark that dictates
its inherent distinctiveness, not the other way around. A rote application of
the <i>Abercrombie</i> test yields the conclusion that the Star Symbol is an
arbitrary or fanciful mark because it � �bear[s] no relationship to the
products or services to which [it is] applied.� � <i>Pebble Beach,</i> 155 F.3d
at 540 (quoting <i>Zatarains,</i> 698 F.2d at 791).<a href="#_ftn69"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[69]</span></span></span></a> Were we to apply the <i>Abercrombie</i>
test mechanically to the Star Symbol, without an eye to the question the test
seeks to answer, we would be left with the conclusion that the Star Symbol is
inherently distinctive. The district court, aware of that result, proceeded to
apply the <i>Seabrook Foods</i> test. <i>See Amazing Spaces,</i> 665 F.Supp.2d
at 737.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both the Supreme Court and scholars have questioned
the applicability of the <i>Abercrombie</i> test to marks other than words. <i>See
Wal&#8211;Mart Stores,</i> 529 U.S. at 210&#8211;13, (noting that the <i>Abercrombie</i>
test was developed and applied �[i]n the context of word marks� and declining
to apply it to a mark consisting of product design); <i>Qualitex,</i> 514 U.S.
at 162&#8211;63 (referring to the <i>Abercrombie</i> test but not applying it
to a mark consisting of a shade of color); RESTATEMENT � 13 cmt. d, at 107
(�[U]nless the symbol or design is striking, unusual, or otherwise likely to
differentiate the products of a particular producer, the designation is not
inherently distinctive.�); 1 MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS � 7:33, at
7&#8211;88.1&#8211;89 (�Ordinary geometric shapes ... are regarded as
nondistinctive and protectable only upon proof of secondary meaning....
However, uncommon or unusual shapes and symbols ... can be regarded as
inherently distinctive.... The issue is whether this shape is so unusual for
this type of goods or services that its distinctiveness can be assumed.�); 1
MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS � 8:13, at 8&#8211;58.1 (�Only in some cases does [<i>Abercrombie</i>]
classification make sense [for trade dress].... The word spectrum of marks
simply does not translate into the world of shapes and images.�); 2 MCCARTHY ON
TRADEMARKS � 11:2, at 11&#8211;7 (�Use of the spectrum of descriptive,
suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful is largely confined to word marks. It is
usually not suitable for nonword designations such as shapes and images making
up trade dress.�). We do not go so far as to hold that the <i>Abercrombie</i>
test is eclipsed every time a mark other than a word is at issue. Instead, we
hold that the <i>Abercrombie</i> test fails to illuminate the fundamental
inquiry in this case: whether the Star Symbol's � �intrinsic nature serves to
identify� � Amazing Spaces and its storage services. <i>Wal&#8211;Mart Stores,</i>
529 U.S. at 210 (quoting <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753).
For the answer to that question, we now turn to the <i>Seabrook Foods</i> test
employed by the district court.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In determining whether a design is arbitrary or distinctive
this court has looked to [1] whether it was a �common� basic shape or design,
[2] whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field, [3] whether it was

Trading</i> court and Professor McCarthy that the <i>Seabrook Foods</i> factors
are variations on a theme rather than discrete inquiries. In <i>Star Industries
v. Bacardi &amp; Co.,</i> the Second Circuit noted that ��[c]ommon basic
shapes' or letters are, as a matter of law, not inherently distinctive ...,
[but] stylized shapes or letters may qualify, provided the design is not
commonplace but rather unique or unusual in the relevant market.� 412 F.3d 373,
382 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <i>Seabrook Foods,</i> 568 F.2d at 1344; <i>Permatex
Co. v. Cal. Tube Prods., Inc.,</i> 175 U.S.P.Q. 764, 766 (TTAB1972)). This
statement, turning on whether the symbol or design is �common,� comprises,
essentially, the first two <i>Seabrook Foods</i> factors. However, the third <i>Seabrook
Foods </i>factor similarly asks whether a symbol or design is �common� in the
sense that it is likely to be perceived by the public as ornamentation rather
than a mark. <i>See Wiley v. Am. Greetings&nbsp; Corp.,</i> 762 F.2d 139, 142

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span

was �not a plain five-pointed star� but was instead �shaded and set within a
circle,� rendering it �sufficient[ly] styliz[ed]� to be �more than a common
geometric shape.� <i>Amazing Spaces,</i> 665 F.Supp.2d at 737. It then
proceeded to conclude that the Star Symbol �[wa]s not inherently distinctive
and d[id] not act as an indicator of origin for any self-storage business,
including Amazing Spaces.� <i>Id.</i> at 738. It supported this assertion with
a discussion of �[t]he ubiquitous nature of the five-pointed star set within a
circle� in Texas, specifically its �use[ ] as a decoration or ornamentation on innumerable
buildings, signs, roads, and products.� <i>Id.</i> The court concluded that
this ubiquity&#8212;including use of the same or a similar star design in 63

to an unshaded five-pointed star design not set within a circle. However, we

actual appearance to its corresponding platonic form. Instead, as discussed
above, asking whether a shape is stylized is merely another way of asking
whether the design is �commonplace� or �unique or unusual in the relevant
market,� <i>Star Indus.,</i> 412 F.3d at 382 (citing <i>Permatex,</i> 175

the FIJI trade dress, which includes the following elements: the use of a
bottle with a dominantly square shape, with a recessed central body portion
defined by the protruding shoulders and base portions of the bottle, a blue
bottle cap, a transparent outer front label with a pink accent in the lower
right hand corner, a depiction of a blue background and palm tree fronds on the
inside of the back label, a three-dimensional effect created by having a
transparent label on the front panel of the bottle revealing the inner side of
the back label, a rainwater drop on the front label, a statement on the front
label stating �From the islands of Fiji/Natural Artesian Water,� and prominent
use of the four-letter, two-syllable word FIJI, in block white lettering with a
metallic outline around the letters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The second element that FIJI must establish to
succeed on the merits for its trade dress infringement claim is that its trade
dress is inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning. Packaging
such as the FIJI bottle shape and label design is inherently distinctive if
�[its] intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source.� <i>Wal&#8211;Mart
Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc</i>., 529 U.S. 205, 210, (2000); see also 1 <i>McCarthy
on Trademarks</i> � 8:12.50 (4th ed. 2010) (bottle is packaging). To determine
whether packaging is so �unique, unusual, or unexpected in this market that one
can assume without proof that it will automatically be perceived by consumers
as an indicator of origin,� the court may look to (1) whether the design is a
common, basic shape or design, (2) whether it was unique or unusual in a
particular field, (3) whether it was a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted
and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by
the public as a dress or ornamentation for the goods, or (4) whether it was
capable of creating a commercial impression distinct from the accompanying
words. <i>Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar&#8211;Well Foods Ltd</i>., 568 F.2d 1342
(CPPA 1977). <i>See Wal&#8211;Mart Stores, Inc</i>., 529 U.S. at 210 (noting
that the Abercrombie spectrum of distinctiveness is properly applied to word
marks); see also 1 <i>McCarthy on Trademarks</i> � 8:13 (4th ed. 2010)
(commenting that Seabrook test is preferred for classifying inherently
distinctive trade dress in packaging and containers); <i>DCNL, Inc. v. Almar
Sales Co</i>., 47 U.S.P.Q.2d 1406, 1997 WL 913941 (N.D.Cal.1997), aff'd without
opinion, 178 F.3d 1308 (9th Cir.1998).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the square bottle and blue cap elements
may be fairly common in the bottled water industry, the stylized hibiscus, the
palm fronds and the three-dimensional effect of the transparent front label
with palm fronds on the inside back label are not a common design. <i>Contra
Paddington Corp. v. Attiki Imps. &amp; Distribs., In</i>c., 996 F.2d 577 (2d
Cir.1993) (giving examples of designs that are not inherently distinctive in certain
markets, such as packaging lime soda in green cans or showing a shining car on
a bottle of car wax). The stylized white block letters with metallic outline
for the word �FIJI,� together with the tropical foliage using hues of blue and
green and the raindrop invites consumers to imagine fresh, clear water from a
remote tropical island. Reviewing the 2008 Bottled Water Guide that FIJI
submitted reveals no other brands that combine the elements of the square
bottle, three-dimensional labeling effect, and tropical motif. FIJI has won
international awards for print and packaging excellence and design innovation
in the food packaging industry, which is strong evidence that its packaging is
unique or unusual in the field and not simply a variation on existing bottled
water designs. Finally, the transparent three-dimensional label distinguishes
FIJI from the other brands, and makes the trade dress recognizable even apart
from the block-letter word mark FIJI, as evidenced by some of the open-ended
responses consumers gave in FIJI's consumer confusion survey. Based on this
evidence, the Court concludes that FIJI's trade dress is inherently
distinctive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In June 1996, inspired by the success of flavored
vodkas introduced by leading international companies such as Stolichnaya,
Star's president decided to develop an orange-flavored Georgi vodka. A new
label was designed, consisting of the traditional Georgi label, which contains
a coat of arms and a logo consisting of stylized capital letters spelling
�Georgi� on a white background, together with three new elements: an orange
slice, the words �orange flavored,� and a large elliptical letter �O� appearing
below the �Georgi� logo and surrounding all of the other elements. The �O� was
rendered as a vertical oval, with the outline of the �O� slightly wider along
the sides (about one quarter inch thick) and narrowing at the top and bottom
(about one eighth inch thick); the outline of the �O� is colored orange and
decorated with two thin gold lines, one bordering the inside and one bordering
the outside of the outline. Star was apparently the first company to distribute
an orange-flavored alcoholic beverage packaged in a bottle bearing a large
elliptical orange letter �O.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court erred when it described the Star
�O� as a basic geometric shape or letter, and therefore rejected inherent
distinctiveness and required a showing of secondary meaning. The Star �O� is
not a �common basic shape� or letter, and the district court's holding to the
contrary was premised on a misunderstanding of this trademark law concept.
Unshaded linear representations of common shapes or letters are referred to as
�basic.� They are not protectable as inherently distinctive, because to protect
them as trademarks would be to deprive competitors of fundamental communicative
devices essential to the dissemination of information to consumers. However,
stylized letters or shapes are not �basic,� and are protectable when original
within the relevant market. <i>See Courtenay Communications Corp. v. Hall, 334
F.3d 210, 215 n.32 (2d Cir.2003)</i> (distinguishing case of mark consisting of
word displayed with distinctive �typeface, color, and other design elements,�
which was protectable, from cases holding generic words not protectable); <i>compare
W</i><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:black'> </span>In re W.B. Roddenbery Co., 135 U.S.P.Q. 215, 216 (TTAB1962)
</i>(holding design consisting of colored circle attached to differently
colored rectangle protectable as inherently distinctive) <i>with In re
Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co.,</i> 40 C.C.P.A. 990, 204 F.2d 287, 288 (1953)
(noting that applicant conceded that unshaded line oval was not inherently
distinctive). Star's �O� is sufficiently stylized to be inherently distinctive
and therefore protectable as a trademark. It is stylized with respect to
shading, border, and thickness, and each of these design elements distinguishes
it from the simple or basic shapes and letters that have been held
unprotectable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Star �O� design had sufficient shape and color
stylization to render it slightly more than a simply linear representation of
an ellipse or the letter �O.� It was, furthermore, a unique design in the
alcoholic beverage industry at the time it was introduced. This suffices to
establish its inherent distinctiveness and thus its protectability.
Furthermore, the Star �O� design is protectable separately from the other
design elements on the Georgi orange-flavored vodka label precisely because the
�O� design is itself inherently distinctive. <i>See In re E.J. Brach &amp;
Sons,</i> 45 C.C.P.A. 998, 256 F.2d 325, 327 (1958); <i>W.B. Roddenbery,</i>
135 U.S.P.Q. at 216. However, the extent of stylization was marginal at best.
The outline of the �O,� though not uniform, is ordinary in its slightly varying
width, and the interior and exterior borders are also ordinary. The result is a
�thin� or weak mark, which will be entitled to only limited protection. <i>See
Libman Co. v. Vining Indus.,</i> 69 F.3d 1360, 1363 (7th Cir.1995).</p>

the Acquired Distinctiveness of Nonverbal Marks</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The secondary meaning analysis of nonverbal marks is largely
the same as that of verbal marks.&nbsp; Courts tend to use essentially the same
factors and considerations for both.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Herman Miller, Inc.
v. Palazzetti Imports and Exports, Inc</i>., 270 F.3d 298 (6th Cir. 2001)
(reviewing seven factors to determine that Herman Miller had raised an issue of

2001) (finding insufficient evidence of secondary meaning in plaintiff�s label
designs for scented candles).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courts may treat one factor differently, however, in the
context of product configuration.&nbsp; Evidence that the defendant
deliberately copied from the plaintiff may not carry as much weight when the
defendant copied product configuration.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Kaufman

plaintiff�s toy doll and packaging, stating that �[t]he probative value of
evidence of intentional copying is particularly limited in cases involving

desirable feature, rather than seeking to confuse consumers as to the source of
the product.� <i>Duraco Products, Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enterprises, Ltd</i>., 40

to Protection</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if a trademark is distinctive of source, it will still
be denied protection if it falls within one of the statutory bars established
under Lanham Act � 2, 15 U.S.C. �1052.&nbsp; We review the most important of
these statutory bars here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to note that, strictly speaking, the � 2 statutory
bars are bars only to the <i>registration</i> of a mark at the PTO.&nbsp;
Recall however that the Lanham Act will protect both registered marks under �
32, 15 U.S.C. � 1114, and unregistered marks under � 43(a), 15 U.S.C. �
1125(a).&nbsp; It is generally assumed that if courts would refuse or cancel
the registration of a mark under one of the statutory bars established in � 2,
courts will also deny protection to the unregistered mark under � 43(a) for the
same reason.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc</i>., 505
U.S. 763, 768 (1992) (�[I]t is common ground that � 43(a) protects qualifying
unregistered trademarks and that the general principles qualifying a mark for
registration under � 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in
determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under �
43(a).�).&nbsp; Thus, for example, if an applied-for mark would be refused
registration as scandalous under � 2, it would also be denied protection under
� 43(a) for the same underlying rationale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will not review the specifics of the registration process
until Section II.D.&nbsp; However, in order to complete our picture of what
marks qualify for protection, be they registered or unregistered, we will
necessarily review opinions in this section that involve questions of
registration.&nbsp; Thus, the reader will need to tolerate references to
certain aspects of the registration process that will not become clear until
Section II.D.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even when a product (or packaging) feature is distinctive of
source, trademark law will not protect that product feature if it is
�functional.� <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 2(e)(5), 15 U.S.C. �1052(e)(5)
(prohibiting the registration of any mark that �comprises any matter that, as a
whole, is functional�).&nbsp; Of course, all source-distinctive product
features are functional in the lay sense that they function to indicate the
source of the product to which they are attached or of which they form a
part.&nbsp; In trademark law, however, functionality is a term of art denoting
a legal conclusion about the particular nature or degree of the product
feature�s technical or competitive importance.&nbsp; The opinions excerpted in
this subsection cover both categories of functionality in U.S. trademark law:
�utilitarian functionality� (or as some call it, �mechanical functionality�)
and �aesthetic functionality.�&nbsp; The name of the first category may sound
like a redundancy, and the name of the second, an oxymoron, yet the underlying
policy goals that inform utilitarian and aesthetic functionality doctrine show
that the two categories have much in common.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following three opinions&#8212;<i>In re Morton-Norwich
Products, Inc</i>., 671 F.3d 1322 (CCPA 1982); <i>Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives
Labs., Inc</i>., 456 U.S. 844 (1982); and <i>TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing
Displays, Inc</i>., 532 U.S. 23 (2001)&#8212;provide the foundation for current
functionality doctrine in the federal courts.&nbsp; <i>Morton-Norwich</i> has
given us the four �<i>Morton-Norwich</i> factors� that the Federal Circuit and
consequently the PTO and TTAB use to determine functionality.&nbsp; <i>Inwood</i>
is the source of the famous (in trademark circles) footnote number 10, which
states that �a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or
purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the
article.�&nbsp; <i>Inwood</i>, 456 U.S. at 851 n. 10.&nbsp; By the time of the
Supreme Court�s <i>TrafFix</i> opinion in 2001, functionality doctrine had
increasingly come to rely on competition-oriented (and plaintiff-friendly)
tests for functionality.&nbsp; <i>TrafFix</i> sought to return functionality
doctrine to <i>Inwood</i>�s �traditional� definition of functionality.&nbsp; In
the next subsection, we will consider whether <i>TrafFix</i> has successfully
done so.&nbsp; First, however, we must gain a grounding in the foundational
cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In reading <i>In re Morton-Norwich Products, Inc</i>., 671
F.3d 1322 (CCPA 1982), consider the following questions:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When the <i>Morton-Norwich</i> opinion turns to the question of
the functionality of the spray bottle design at issue, it appears to adopt
several different definitions of �functionality� (e.g., a product feature is
nonfunctional if competitor�s have �no necessity to copy it�; a product feature
is nonfunctional where there is �no evidence that it was dictated� by the
functions to be performed by the product; a product feature is functional if
the granting of exclusive rights in it �will hinder competition�).&nbsp; Are
these different approaches equivalent?&nbsp; Which are more plaintiff-friendly
or defendant-friendly?</p>

cannot function as a trademark. In the second action she requested applicant to
�amplify the description of the mark with such particularity that any <i>portion</i>
of the alleged mark considered to be non functional (sic) is incorporated in
the description.� (Emphasis ours.) She said, �The Examiner sees none.� Having
already furnished two affidavits to the effect that consumers spontaneously
associate the package design with appellant's products, which had been sold in
the container to the number of 132,502,000 by 1978, appellant responded to the
examiner's request by pointing out, in effect, that it is the overall
configuration of the container rather than any particular feature of it which
is distinctive and that it was intentionally designed to be so, supplying
several pieces of evidence showing several other containers of different
appearance which perform the same functions. Appellant also produced the
results of a survey conducted by an independent market research firm which had
been made in response to the examiner's demand for evidence of distinctiveness.
The examiner dismissed all of the evidence as �not persuasive� and commented
that there had �still not been one iota of evidence offered that the subject matter
of this application has been promoted as a trademark,� which she seemed to
consider a necessary element of proof. She adhered to her view that the design
�is no more than a non-distinctive purely functional container for the goods
plus a purely functional spray trigger controlled closure * * * essentially
utilitarian and non-arbitrary * * *.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellant responded to the final rejection with a
simultaneously filed notice of appeal to the board and a request for
reconsideration, submitting more exhibits in support of its position that its
container design was not �purely functional.� The examiner held fast to all of
her views and forwarded the appeal, repeating the substance of her rejections in
her Answer to appellant's appeal brief. An oral hearing was held before the
board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Board Opinion</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The board, citing three cases, stated it to be
�well-settled� that the configuration of a container �may be registrable for
the particular contents thereof if the shape is non-functional in character,
and is, in fact, inherently distinctive, or has acquired secondary meaning as
an indication of origin for such goods.� In discussing the �utilitarian nature�
of the alleged trademark, the board took note of photographs of appellant's
containers for FANTASTIK spray cleaner and GREASE RELIEF degreaser, the labels
of which bore the words, respectively, �adjustable easy sprayer,� and �NEW!
Trigger Control Top,� commenting that �the advertising pertaining to
applicant's goods promotes the word marks of the various products and the
desirable functional features of the containers.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In light of the above, and after detailed review of
appellant's survey evidence without any specific comment on it, the board
concluded its opinion as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>After a careful review of the evidence in the case before
us, we cannot escape the conclusion that the container for applicant's
products, <i>the configuration</i> of which it seeks to register, <i>is
dictated primarily by functional (utilitarian) considerations</i>, and is
therefore unregistrable despite any de facto secondary meaning which
applicant's survey and other evidence of record might indicate. As stated in
the case of In re Deister Concentrator Company, Inc. (48 CCPA 952, 289 F.2d
496, 129 USPQ 314 (1961), �not every word or configuration that has a de facto
secondary meaning is protected as a trademark.� (Emphasis ours.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>Issues</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The parties do not see the issues in the same
light. Appellant and the solicitor agree that the primary issue before us is
whether the subject matter sought to be registered&#8212;the configuration of
the container&#8212;is �functional.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellant states a second issue to be whether the
configuration has the capacity to and does distinguish its goods in the
marketplace from the goods of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The solicitor contends that it would be �premature�
for us to decide the second issue if we disagree with the PTO on the first
issue and have to reach it, and that we should, in that event, remand the case
so the board can �consider� it. Whether to remand is, therefore, an issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>OPINION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As would be expected, the arguments made in this
court are, except for the remand question, essentially the same as they were
below. The question is not new and in various forms we have been over the
ground before: is the design sought to be registered �functional�? There is a
plethora of case law on this subject and it becomes a question of which precedents
to follow here&#8212;and why. In our view, it would be useful to review the
development of the principles which we must apply in order to better understand
them. In doing so, it should be borne in mind that this is not a �configuration
of goods� case but a �configuration of the container for the goods� case. One
question is whether the law permits, on the facts before us, exclusive
appropriation of the precise configuration described in the application to
register. Another facet of the case is whether that configuration in fact
functions as a trademark so as to be entitled to registration. We turn first to
a consideration of the development of the law on �functionality.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A trademark is defined as �any word, name, symbol,
or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or
merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or
sold by others� (emphasis ours). 15 U.S.C. s 1127 (1976). Thus, it was long the
rule that a trademark must be something other than, and separate from, the
merchandise to which it is applied. Davis v. Davis, 27 F. 490, 492

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Aside from the trademark/product �separateness�
rationale for not recognizing the bare design of an article or its container as
a trademark, it was theorized that all such designs would soon be appropriated,
leaving nothing for use by would-be competitors. One court, for example, feared
that �The forms and materials of packages to contain articles of merchandise *
* * would be rapidly taken up and appropriated by dealers, until someone,
bolder than the others, might go to the very root of things, and claim for his
goods the primitive brown paper and tow string, as a peculiar property.�

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span

matter later gave way to assertions that one or more features of a product or
package design could legally function as a trademark. E.g., Alan Wood Steel Co.
v. Watson, 150 F.Supp. 861, 863, 113 USPQ 311, 312 (D.D.C.1957); Capewell Horse
Nail Co. v. Mooney, supra. It was eventually held that the entire design of an
article (or its container) could, without other means of identification,
function to identify the source of the article and be protected as a trademark.
E.g., In re Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., 51 CCPA 1546, 1547-48, 335

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span

designs of articles and containers, or features thereof, which were
�nonfunctional.� See generally, L. Amdur, Trade-Mark Law and Practice ss 5-7
(1948); R. Callmann, Unfair Competition Trade-Marks and Monopolies ss 71.4,
77.4(e) and 98.4(d) (1967); W. Derenberg, Trade-Mark Protection and Unfair

requirement of �nonfunctionality� is not mandated by statute, but �is deduced entirely
from court decisions.� In re Mogen David Wine Corp., 51 CCPA 1260, 1269, 328

It has as its genesis the judicial theory that there exists a fundamental right
to compete through imitation of a competitor's product, which right can only be
temporarily denied by the patent or copyright laws:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>If one manufacturer should make an advance in effectiveness
of operation, or in simplicity of form, or in utility of color; and if that
advance did not entitle him to a monopoly by means of a machine or process or a
product or a design patent; and if by means of unfair trade suits he could shut
out other manufacturers who plainly intended to share in the benefits of
unpatented utilities * * * he would be given gratuitously a monopoly more
effective than that of the unobtainable patent in the ratio of eternity to
seventeen years. (Pope Automatic Merchandising Co. v. McCrum-Howell Co., 191 F.
979, 981-82 (7th Cir. 1911).)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> An exception to the right to copy exists, however,
where the product or package design under consideration is �nonfunctional� and
serves to identify its manufacturer or seller, and the exception exists even
though the design is not temporarily protectible through acquisition of patent
or copyright. Thus, when a design is �nonfunctional,� the right to compete
through imitation gives way, presumably upon balance of that right with the
originator's right to prevent others from infringing upon an established symbol
of trade identification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This preliminary discussion leads to the heart of
the matter&#8212;how do we define the concept of �functionality,� and what role
does the above balancing of interests play in that definitional process?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>I. Functionality
Defined</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Many courts speak of the protectability as
trademarks of product and package configurations in terms of whether a
particular design is �functional� or �nonfunctional.� Without proper
definition, however, such a distinction is useless for determining whether such
design is registrable or protectable as a trademark, for the label �functional�
has dual significance. It has been used, on the one hand, in lay fashion to indicate
�the normal or characteristic action of anything,� and, on the other hand, it
has been used to denote a legal conclusion. Compare, In re Penthouse
International Ltd., 565 F.2d 679, 681, 195 USPQ 698, 699-700 (CCPA 1977) (If
the product configuration �has a non-trademark function, the inquiry is not at
an end; possession of a function and of a capability of indicating origin are
not in every case mutually exclusive.�), with In re Mogen David Wine Corp., 51
CCPA supra at 1270, 328 F.2d at 933, 140 USPQ at 582 (Rich, J., concurring)
(�The Restatement appears to use the terms �functional� and �nonfunctional� as
labels to denote the legal consequence: if the former, the public may copy; and
if the latter, it may not. This is the way the �law� has been but it is not of
much help in deciding cases.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, it has been noted that one of the
�distinct questions� involved in �functionality� reasoning is, �In what way is
(the) subject matter functional or utilitarian, factually or legally?� In re
Honeywell, Inc., 497 F.2d 1344, 1350, 181 USPQ 821, 826 (CCPA 1974) (Rich, J.,
concurring). This definitional division�leads to the resolution that if the
designation �functional� is to be utilized to denote the <i>legal</i>
consequence, we must speak in terms of de facto functionality and de jure
functionality, the former being the use of �functional� in the lay sense,
indicating that although the design of a product, a container, or a feature of
either is directed to performance of a function, it may be legally recognized
as an indication of source. De jure functionality, of course, would be used to
indicate the opposite&#8212;such a design may not be protected as a trademark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This is only the beginning, however, for further
definition is required to explain how a determination of whether a design is de
jure functional is to be approached. We start with an inquiry into �utility.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. �Functional� means �utilitarian�<a href="#_ftn78"
name="_ftnref78" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[78]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> From the earliest cases, �functionality� has been
expressed in terms of �utility.� In 1930, this court stated it to be �well
settled that the configuration of <i>an article having utility</i> is not the
subject of trade-mark protection.� (Emphasis ours.) In re Dennison Mfg. Co., 17
CCPA 987, 988, 39 F.2d 720 (1930) (Arbitrary urn or vase-like shape of
reinforcing patch on a tag.). Accord, Sparklets Corp. v. Walter Kidde Sales
Co., 26 CCPA 1342, 1345, 104 F.2d 396, 399 (1939); In re National Stone-Tile
Corp., 19 CCPA 1101, 1102, 57 F.2d 382, 383 (1932). This broad statement of the
�law�, that the design of an article �having utility� cannot be a trademark, is
incorrect and inconsistent with later pronouncements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We wish to make it clear�that a discussion of
�functionality� is always in reference to the design of the thing under
consideration (in the sense of its appearance) and not the thing itself. One
court, for example, paraphrasing Gertrude Stein, commented that �a dish is a
dish is a dish.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Hygienic Specialties Co. v. H. G. Salzman, Inc.,
302 F.2d 614, 621, 133 USPQ 96, 103 (2d Cir. 1962).&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, by
definition, a dish always functions as a dish and has its utility, but it is
the appearance of the dish which is important in a case such as this, as will
become clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Assuming the <i>Dennison</i> court intended that
its statement reference an article whose configuration �has utility,� its
statement is still too broad. Under that reasoning, the design of a particular
article would be protectable as a trademark only where the design was useless,
that is, wholly unrelated to the function of the article. For example, where a
merchant sought to register on the supplemental register the overall
configuration of a triangular chemical cake for use in a process of metal
plating, this court stated that the shape was capable of becoming a trademark
because it �is entirely arbitrary and, except for its solidity (all shapes
being solid), has no functional significance whatever.� In re Minnesota Mining
and Mfg. Co., 51 CCPA supra at 1551, 335 F.2d at 840.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Most designs, however, result in the production of
articles, containers, or features thereof which are indeed utilitarian, and
examination into the possibility of trademark protection is not to the mere
existence of utility, but to the degree of design utility. The ore
concentrating and coal cleaning table shape in <i>Deister</i>, for example, was
refused registration as a trademark because its shape was �in essence
utilitarian,� 48 CCPA supra at 968, 289 F.2d at 506. Likewise, the design of a
cast aluminum fitting for joining lengths of tubing together was denied
registration because it was held to be �in essence utilitarian or functional.�
In re Hollaender Mfg. Co., 511 F.2d 1186, 1189 (CCPA 1975). The configuration
of a thermostat cover was also refused registration because a round cover was
�probably * * * the most utilitarian� design which could have been selected for
a round mechanism. In re Honeywell, Inc., 532 F.2d 180, 182 (CCPA 1976).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, it is the �utilitarian� design of a
�utilitarian� object with which we are concerned, and the manner of use of the
term �utilitarian� must be examined at each occurrence. The latter occurrence
is, of course, consistent with the lay meaning of the term.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the
former is being used to denote a legal consequence (it being synonymous with
�functional�), and it therefore requires further explication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. �Utilitarian� means �superior in function (de facto)
or economy of manufacture,� which �superiority� is determined in light of
competitive necessity to copy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some courts have stated this proposition in the negative. In
American-Marietta Co. v. Krigsman, 275 F.2d 287, 289 (2d Cir. 1960), the court
stated that �those features of the original goods that are not in any way
essential to their use� may be termed �nonfunctional.� But what does this
statement mean? In the case at bar, for example, we cannot say that it means
that the subject design is �functional� merely because a hollow body, a handhold,
and a pump sprayer are �essential to its use.� What this phrase must mean is
not that the generic parts of the article or package are essential, but, as
noted above, that the particular design of the whole assembly of those parts
must be essential. This, of course, leaves us to define �essential to its use,�
which is also the starting place for those courts which have set forth in
positive fashion the reasons they believe that some product or package designs
are not protectible as trademarks and thus not registrable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In Luminous Unit Co. v. Williamson, 241 F. 265
(N.D.Ill.1917), the court noted that �the owner of a fixture, machine, or
device, patented or unpatented, who has obtained a trade in it, may simply
exclude others from taking away that trade when they deceive the purchasing
public as to the origin of the goods sold by them.� Id. at 268. The court went
on to state an exception to this rule, which is the public right to copy those
�Necessary elements of mechanical construction, essential to the practical
operation of a device, and which cannot be changed without either lessening the
efficiency or materially increasing expense.� Id. at 269. The court in Diamond
Match Co. v. Saginaw Match Co., 142 F. 727, 729 (6th Cir. 1906), was of the
same opinion. In response to a claim that the defendant was engaging in unfair
competition by marketing matches with composite heads in two colors, the court,
noting that the match was not protected by patent, stated that he who has a
right to make a tipped match �has a right to put on it a head of two colors, so
as to distinguish the tip on which the match should be struck, from the head
itself. The two colors, therefore, serve not only a useful purpose but an
essential function, for the very essence of the tipped match is the tip itself,
which must be marked out by a color of its own.� Another court framed the issue
this way: Is the subject matter �made in the form it must be made if it is to
accomplish its purpose�? Marvel Co. v. Tullar Co., 125 F. 829, 830
(S.D.N.Y.1903).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, it is clear that courts in the past have
considered the public policy involved in this area of the law as, not the right
to slavishly copy articles which are not protected by patent or copyright, but
the need to copy those articles, which is more properly termed the right to
compete effectively. Even the earliest cases, which discussed protectability in
terms of exhaustion of possible packaging forms, recognized that the real issue
was whether �the effect would be to gradually throttle trade.� Harrington v.
Libby, supra at 606.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> More recent cases also discuss �functionality� in
light of competition. One court noted that the �question in each case is
whether protection against imitation will hinder the competitor in
competition.� Truck Equipment Service Co. v. Fruehauf Corp., 536 F.2d 1210,
1218 (8th Cir. 1976). Another court, upon suit for trademark infringement (the
alleged trademark being plaintiff's building design), stated that �enjoining
others from using the building design (would not) inhibit competition in any
way.� Fotomat Corp. v. Cochran, 437 F.Supp. 1231, 1235 (D.Kan.1977). This court
has also referenced �hinderance of competition� in a number of the
�functionality� cases which have been argued before it. E.g., In re Penthouse
International Ltd., 565 F.2d supra at 682 (Would protection of the design
�hinder competition�?); In re Mogen David Wine Corp., 51 CCPA supra at 1270,
328 F.2d at 933 (Rich, J., concurring, cited with approval in Penthouse
International, supra, stated that, �Whether competition would in fact be
hindered is really the crux of the matter.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Restatement of Torts, s 742, designates a
design of goods as �functional� if it �affects their purpose, action or
performance, or the facility or economy of processing, handling or using them *
* *.� (Emphasis ours.) To ensure that use of the word �affects� was clear,
Comment a to that section indicates that a �feature� may be found �functional�
if it �contributes to� the utility, durability, effectiveness or ease of use,
or the efficiency or economy of manufacture of that �feature.� Excusing the
fact that the design of the �feature� is not referenced, and equating �feature�
with �design,� this seems to take us back to where we started&#8212;with those
cases that deny trademark protection to those articles �having utility.�
Further, it appears to us that �affects� and �contributes to� are both so broad
as to be meaningless, for every design �affects� or �contributes to� the
utility of the article in which it is embodied. �Affects� is broad enough to
include a design which reduces the utility or the economy of manufacture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the Restatement appears to ignore the
policies which created the law of �functionality,� it is noted at the end of
the first paragraph of Comment a to s 742, in accord with the cases previously
discussed, that we should examine whether prohibition of imitation by others
will �deprive them of something which will substantially hinder them in
competition.� </p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>II. Determining �Functionality�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. In general</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Keeping in mind, as shown by the foregoing review,
that �functionality� is determined in light of �utility,� which is determined
in light of �superiority of design,� and rests upon the foundation �essential
to effective competition,� Ives Laboratories, Inc. v. Darby Drug Co., 601 F.2d
631, 643 (2d Cir. 1979), and cases cited supra, there exist a number of
factors, both positive and negative, which aid in that determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Previous opinions of this court have discussed what
evidence is useful to demonstrate that a particular design is �superior.� In In
re Shenango Ceramics, Inc., 53 CCPA 1268, 1273, 362 F.2d 287, 291 (1966), the
court noted that the existence of an expired utility patent which disclosed the
utilitarian advantage of the design sought to be registered as a trademark was
evidence that it was �functional.� Accord, Best Lock Corp. v. Schlage Lock Co.,
56 CCPA supra at 1477, 413 F.2d at 1199; Mine Safety Appliances Co. v. Storage
Battery Co., 56 CCPA 863, 864, 405 F.2d 901, 902 (1969); In re Deister
Concentrator Co., 48 CCPA supra at 962, 289 F.2d at 501; Daniel v. Electric
Hose &amp; Rubber Co., 231 F. 827, 833 (3d Cir. 1916). It may also be
significant that the originator of the design touts its utilitarian advantages
through advertising. Shenango, supra; Deister, supra; Mine Safety Appliances,
supra; In re Pollak Steel Co., 50 CCPA 1045, 1046-47, 314 F.2d 566, 567 (1963).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Since the effect upon competition �is really the
crux of the matter,� it is, of course, significant that there are other
alternatives available. Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks at 377;
compare, Time Mechanisms, Inc. v. Qonaar Corp., 422 F.Supp. 905, 913 (D.N.J.1976)

(CCPA 1973) (�We think competitors can readily meet the demand for packaged
candy bars by use of other packaging styles, and we find no utilitarian
advantages flowing from this package design as opposed to others as was found
in the rhomboidally-shaped deck involved in <i>Deister</i>.�) and In re Mogen
David Wine Corp., 51 CCPA supra at 1270, 328 F.2d at 933 (Rich, J., concurring.
�Others can meet any real or imagined demand for wine in decanter-type bottles&#8212;assuming
there is any such thing&#8212;without being in the least hampered in
competition by inability to copy the Mogen David bottle design.�) and In re
Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co., 51 CCPA supra at 1551, 335 F.2d at 840 (It was
noted to be an undisputed fact of record that the article whose design was
sought to be registered �could be formed into almost any shape.�) and Fotomat
Corp. v. Cochran, 437 F.Supp. supra at 1235 (The court noted that the design of
plaintiff's building functioned �no better than a myriad of other building
designs.�) with In re Honeywell, Inc., 532 F.2d at 182, 189 USPQ at 344 (A
portion of the board opinion which the court adopted noted that there �are only
so many basic shapes in which a thermostat or its cover can be made,� but then
concluded that, �The fact that thermostat covers may be produced in other forms
or shapes does not and cannot detract from the functional character of the
configuration here involved.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is also significant that a particular design
results from a comparatively simple or cheap method of manufacturing the
article. In Schwinn Bicycle Co. v. Murray Ohio Mfg. Co., 339 F.Supp. 973, 980
(M.D.Tenn.1971), aff'd, 470 F.2d 975 (6th Cir. 1972), the court stated its
reason for refusing to recognize the plaintiff's bicycle rim surface design as
a trademark:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The evidence is uncontradicted that the various
manufacturers of bicycle rims in the United States consider it commercially
necessary to mask, hide or camouflage the roughened and charred appearance
resulting from welding the tubular rim sections together. The evidence
represented indicates that the only other process used by bicycle rim
manufacturers in the United States is the more complex and more expensive
process of grinding and polishing.</p>

314 F.2d at 570; Luminous Unit Co. v. R. Williamson &amp; Co., supra at 269.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. The case at bar</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. The evidence of functionality</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We come now to the task of applying to the facts of
this case the distilled essence of the body of law on �functionality� above
discussed. The question is whether appellant's plastic spray bottle is de jure
functional; is it the best or one of a few superior designs available? We hold,
on the basis of the evidence before the board, that it is not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The board thought otherwise but did not state a
single supporting reason. In spite of her strong convictions about it, neither
did the examiner. Each expressed mere opinions and it is not clear to us what
either had in mind in using the terms �functional� and �utilitarian.� Of
course, the spray bottle is highly useful and performs its intended functions
in an admirable way, but that is not enough to render the design of the spray
bottle&#8212;which is all that matters here&#8212;functional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the examiner appreciated, the spray bottle
consists of two major parts, a bottle and a trigger-operated, spray-producing
pump mechanism which also serves as a closure. We shall call the latter the
spray top. In the first place, a molded plastic bottle can have an infinite
variety of forms or designs and still function to hold liquid. No one form is
necessary or appears to be �superior.� Many bottles have necks, to be grasped
for pouring or holding, and the necks likewise can be in a variety of forms.
The PTO has not produced one iota of evidence to show that the shape of appellant's
bottle was required to be as it is for any de facto functional reason, which
might lead to an affirmative determination of de jure functionality. The
evidence, consisting of competitor's molded plastic bottles for similar
products, demonstrates that the same functions can be performed by a variety of
other shapes with no sacrifice of any functional advantage. There is no
necessity to copy appellant's trade dress to enjoy any of the functions of a
spray-top container.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As to the appearance of the spray top, the evidence
of record shows that it too can take a number of diverse forms, all of which
are equally suitable as housings for the pump and spray mechanisms. Appellant
acquired a patent on the pump mechanism (No. 3,749,290) the drawings of which
show it embodied in a structure which bears not the slightest resemblance to
the appearance of appellant's spray top. The pictures of the competition's
spray bottles further illustrate that no particular housing design is necessary
to have a pump-type sprayer. Appellant's spray top, seen from the side, is
rhomboidal, roughly speaking, a design which bears no relation to the shape of
the pump mechanism housed within it and is an arbitrary decoration&#8212;no
more de jure functional than is the grille of an automobile with respect to its
under-the-hood power plant. The evidence shows that even the shapes of pump
triggers can and do vary while performing the same function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> What is sought to be registered, however, is no
single design feature or component but the overall composite design comprising
both bottle and spray top. While that design must be accommodated to the
functions performed, we see no evidence that it was dictated by them and
resulted in a functionally or economically superior design of such a container.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying the legal principles discussed above, we
do not see that allowing appellant to exclude others (upon proof of
distinctiveness) from using this trade dress will hinder competition or impinge
upon the rights of others to compete effectively in the sale of the goods named
in the application, even to the extent of marketing them in functionally
identical spray containers. The fact is that many others are doing so.
Competitors have apparently had no need to simulate appellant's trade dress, in
whole or in part, in order to enjoy all of the functional aspects of a spray
top container. Upon expiration of any patent protection appellant may now be
enjoying on its spray and pump mechanism, competitors may even copy and enjoy
all of its functions without copying the external appearance of appellant's
spray top.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[79]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If the functions of appellant's bottle can be
performed equally well by containers of innumerable designs and, thus, no one
is injured in competition, why did the board state that appellant's design is
functional and for that reason not registrable?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. The relationship between �functionality� and
distinctiveness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> One who seeks to register (or protect) a product or
container configuration as a trademark must demonstrate that its design is
�nonfunctional,� as discussed above, and that the design functions as an
indication of source, whether inherently so, because of its distinctive nature,
In re McIlhenny, 47 CCPA 985, 989, 278 F.2d 953, 955, (1960); In re
International Playtex Corp., 153 USPQ 377, 378 (TTAB 1967), or through
acquisition of secondary meaning. These two requirements must, however, be kept
separate from one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The issues of distinctiveness and functionality may
have been somewhat intermixed by the board. The design in issue appears to us
to be relatively simple and plain, and the board, although not ruling upon
appellant's contention that its design has acquired secondary meaning,
discussed only distinctiveness before reaching its conclusion that the design
was �functional.� The unexpressed (and perhaps unconscious) thought may have
been that if something is not inherently distinctive (appellant admits that its
design is not), perhaps even austere, then, since it does not at a particular
time function as a legally recognized indication of source, it probably never
will. And since it is so plain that one may believe it is not and never will be
a trademark, it will be perceived&#8212;not that the design is not inherently
distinctive&#8212;but that it is �functional,� without analysis of why it is
believed to be �functional.� The sole criterion seems to have been that the
design is ordinary.<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[80]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While it is certainly arguable that lack of
distinctiveness may, where appropriate, permit an inference that a design was
created primarily with an eye toward the utility of the article, that fact is
by no means conclusive as to the �functionality� of the design of that article.
Whether in fact the design is �functional� requires closer and more careful
scrutiny. We cannot say that there exists an inverse proportional relationship
in all cases between distinctiveness of design and functionality (de facto or
de jure).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court's past opinions which indicate that a
particular design is �nonfunctional� because it is �arbitrary� are not to be
construed as contrary to [the] truism [that a nondistinctive design does not
necessarily equal a �functional� design]. E.g., In re Deister Concentrator Co.,
48 CCPA supra at 968, 289 F.2d at 506; In re Mogen David Wine Corp., 51 CCPA at
1270, 328 F.2d at 933 (Rich, J., concurring). In this situation, �arbitrary� is
not used in the typical trademark (distinctiveness) sense of the word. It is
used to indicate a design which may have been selected without complete
deference to utility and, thus, is most likely �nonfunctional.� That is, it is
used to indicate the opposite side of the �functional� coin, since a design can
be inherently distinctive (the usual trademark law meaning of the word
�arbitrary�) and still be �functional.�</p>

<p class=MsoHeading7><a name="_Toc392009942">Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs.,
Inc.</a></p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>456 U.S. 844 (1982)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Inwood</i> is important for our purposes here mainly because
of its brief, one-sentence footnote 10, which has had an enormous impact on
functionality doctrine.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is worth understanding the basic
facts underlying the <i>Inwood</i> opinion&#8212;facts to which we will return
when we consider secondary liability in trademark law below.&nbsp; Ives
Laboratories, Inc. (�Ives�) manufactured and marketed the patented prescription
drug cyclandelate, a vasodilator, under the registered trademark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>cyclospasmol</span>.&nbsp; After Ives� patent
expired in 1972, several generic drug manufacturers, including Inwood
Laboratories, Inc., began manufacturing and marketing cyclandelate capsules
that copied the appearance, including the color, of Ives� capsules.&nbsp; Ives
brought an action for trademark infringement against the manufacturers.&nbsp;
Ives alleged that the manufacturers were vicariously liable for the
infringement of Ives� <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>cyclospasmol</span>
trademark by pharmacists who placed capsules produced by the generic
manufacturers into bottles labeled with the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>cyclospasmol</span>
mark. The Supreme Court ultimately found that the generic manufacturers were
not liable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the course of her opinion for the Court, Justice O�Connor
noted: �Ives argued that the colors of its capsules were not functional.�&nbsp;
She appended to this statement footnote number 10:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In general terms, a product feature is functional if it is
essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or
quality of the article. <i>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co</i>., 376
U.S. 225, 232 (1964); <i>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co</i>., 305 U.S. 111,
122 (1938).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>It is not clear to what exactly Justice O�Connor was
citing in <i>Stiffel</i>, but the <i>Kellogg</i> court had stated that the
pillow shape of Nabisco�s shredded wheat was functional: �The evidence is
persuasive that this form is functional&#8212;that the cost of the biscuit
would be increased and its high quality lessened if some other form were
substituted for the pillow-shape� <i>Id</i>. at 122.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now nearly forgotten is that <i>Inwood</i> contained further
discussion of the concept of functionality in trademark law.&nbsp; In a
subsequent footnote, Justice O�Connor criticized the <i>Inwood</i> appellate
court for failing to respond to the district court�s determination that the
color of Ives� capsules was functional.&nbsp; <i>Inwood</i>, 456 U.S. at 857 n.
20.&nbsp; In his concurrence joined by Justice Marshall, Justice White also
took the appellate court to task for failing to respond to the district court�s
functionality determination.&nbsp; In doing so, he quoted the appellate court�s
definition of functionality apparently with approval: �A functional characteristic
is �an important ingredient in the commercial success of the product.�� <i>Id</i>.
at 863 (White, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Ives Laboratories, Inc. v. Darby
Drug Co., Inc</i>., 601 F.2d 631 (2nd Cir. 1979)).&nbsp; As we will see below,
this language, going to whether a product feature is �an important ingredient
in the commercial success of the product,� would come back to haunt
functionality doctrine and aesthetic functionality doctrine in particular.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Dashbreak>----------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Between <i>Inwood</i> (1982) and <i>TrafFix</i> (2001),
functionality doctrine appeared to many to have lost its moorings.&nbsp;
Perhaps influenced by <i>Morton-Norwich</i>, courts increasingly relied on
various forms of a �competitive necessity� test to determine if a particular
product feature was functional, and because alternative designs could often be
found or hypothesized, the �competitive necessity� test tended to benefit
plaintiffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>TrafFix</i> attempts to return functionality doctrine to <i>Inwood</i>�s
definition of functionality.&nbsp; But in order to do so, <i>TrafFix</i> had to
explain the meaning of a statement the Court had made six years earlier in <i>Qualitex</i>
(1995). This is the relevant passage from <i>Qualitex</i>:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>This Court consequently has explained that, &quot;[i]n
general terms, a product feature is functional,&quot; and cannot serve as a
trademark, &quot;if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if
it affects the cost or quality of the article,&quot; that is, if exclusive use
of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related
disadvantage. <i>Inwood Laboratories, Inc</i>., 456 U. S., at 850, n. 10.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc</i>., 514
U.S. 159, 165 (1995).&nbsp; Before reading <i>TrafFix</i>, consider this
question: does this passage from <i>Qualitex</i> suggest that <i>Inwood</i>�s
test (�essential to the use or purpose��) is interchangeable with and the
equivalent of the test asking if �exclusive use of the feature would put
competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage�?&nbsp; Would
appellate courts have been justified in assuming the equivalence between these
two statements of the test for functionality?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In reading <i>TrafFix</i>, consider these additional
questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How do we determine if a product feature is �essential to the use
or purpose� of the product?&nbsp; What do we mean by �essential�?&nbsp; That
the product feature is a competitive necessity?&nbsp; An engineering
necessity?&nbsp; How could a product feature be �essential to the use or
purpose� of the product if there are alternative designs that competitors could
use and still compete effectively?</p>

<p class=MsoHeading7><a name="_Toc392009943">TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing
Displays, Inc.</a></p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>532 U.S. 23 (2001)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Temporary road signs with warnings like �Road Work
Ahead� or �Left Shoulder Closed� must withstand strong gusts of wind. An
inventor named Robert Sarkisian obtained two utility patents for a mechanism
built upon two springs (the dual-spring design) to keep these and other outdoor
signs upright despite adverse wind conditions. The holder of the now-expired
Sarkisian patents, respondent Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), established a
successful business in the manufacture and sale of sign stands incorporating
the patented feature. MDI's stands for road signs were recognizable to buyers
and users (it says) because the dual-spring design was visible near the base of
the sign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This litigation followed after the patents expired
and a competitor, TrafFix Devices, Inc., sold sign stands with a visible spring
mechanism that looked like MDI's. MDI and TrafFix products looked alike because
they were. When TrafFix started in business, it sent an MDI product abroad to
have it reverse engineered, that is to say copied. Complicating matters,
TrafFix marketed its sign stands under a name similar to MDI's. MDI used the
name �WindMaster,� while TrafFix, its new competitor, used �WindBuster.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> MDI brought suit under the Trademark Act of 1946
(Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 427, as amended, 15 U.S.C. � 1051 <i>et seq.,</i> against
TrafFix for trademark infringement (based on the similar names), trade dress
infringement (based on the copied dual-spring design), and unfair competition.
TrafFix counterclaimed on antitrust theories. After the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan considered cross-motions for summary
judgment, MDI prevailed on its trademark claim for the confusing similarity of
names and was held not liable on the antitrust counterclaim; and those two
rulings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are not before us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We are concerned with the trade dress question. The
District Court ruled against MDI on its trade dress claim. 971 F.Supp. 262
(E.D.Mich.1997). After determining that the one element of MDI's trade dress at
issue was the dual-spring design, <i>id.,</i> at 265, it held that �no
reasonable trier of fact could determine that MDI has established secondary
meaning� in its alleged trade dress, <i>id.,</i> at 269. In other words,
consumers did not associate the look of the dual-spring design with MDI. As a
second, independent reason to grant summary judgment in favor of TrafFix, the
District Court determined the dual-spring design was functional. On this
rationale secondary meaning is irrelevant because there can be no trade dress
protection in any event. In ruling on the functional aspect of the design, the
District Court noted that Sixth Circuit precedent indicated that the burden was
on MDI to prove that its trade dress was nonfunctional, and not on TrafFix to
show that it was functional (a rule since adopted by Congress, see 15 U.S.C. �
1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)), and then went on to consider MDI's arguments
that the dual-spring design was subject to trade dress protection. Finding none
of MDI's contentions persuasive, the District Court concluded MDI had not
�proffered sufficient evidence which would enable a reasonable trier of fact to
find that MDI's vertical dual-spring design is <i>non</i>-functional.� 971
F.Supp., at 276. Summary judgment was entered against MDI on its trade dress
claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed
the trade dress ruling. 200 F.3d 929 (1999). The Court of Appeals held the
District Court had erred in ruling MDI failed to show a genuine issue of
material fact regarding whether it had secondary meaning in its alleged trade
dress, <i>id.,</i> at 938, and had erred further in determining that MDI could
not prevail in any event because the alleged trade dress was in fact a
functional product configuration, <i>id.,</i> at 940. The Court of Appeals
suggested the District Court committed legal error by looking only to the
dual-spring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress. Basic to its reasoning
was the Court of Appeals' observation that it took �little imagination to
conceive of a hidden dual-spring mechanism or a tri or quad-spring mechanism
that might avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress.� <i>Ibid.</i> The Court of
Appeals explained that �[i]f TrafFix or another competitor chooses to use
[MDI's] dual-spring design, then it will have to find <i>some other way</i> to
set its sign apart to avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress.� <i>Ibid.</i> It
was not sufficient, according to the Court of Appeals, that allowing exclusive
use of a particular feature such as the dual-spring design in the guise of
trade dress would �hinde[r] competition somewhat.� Rather, �[e]xclusive use of
a feature must �put competitors at a <i>significant</i> non-reputation-related
disadvantage� before trade dress protection is denied on functionality
grounds.� <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.,</i>
514 U.S. 159, 165, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 131 L.Ed.2d 248 (1995)). In its criticism of
the District Court's ruling on the trade dress question, the Court of Appeals
took note of a split among Courts of Appeals in various other Circuits on the
issue whether the existence of an expired utility patent forecloses the
possibility of the patentee's claiming trade dress protection in the product's
design. 200 F.3d, at 939. Compare <i>Sunbeam Products, Inc. v. West Bend Co.,</i>
123 F.3d 246 (C.A.5 1997) (holding that trade dress protection is not
foreclosed), <i>Thomas &amp; Betts Corp. v. Panduit Corp.,</i> 138 F.3d 277
(C.A.7 1998) (same), and <i>Midwest Industries, Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc.,</i>
175 F.3d 1356 (C.A.Fed.1999) (same), with <i>Vornado Air Circulation Systems,
Inc. v. Duracraft Corp.,</i> 58 F.3d 1498, 1500 (C.A.10 1995) (�Where a product
configuration is a significant inventive component of an invention covered by a
utility patent ... it cannot receive trade dress protection�). To resolve the
conflict, we granted certiorari. 530 U.S. 1260 (2000).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is well established that trade dress can be
protected under federal law. The design or packaging of a product may acquire a
distinctiveness which serves to identify the product with its manufacturer or
source; and a design or package which acquires this secondary meaning, assuming
other requisites are met, is a trade dress which may not be used in a manner
likely to cause confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the
goods. In these respects protection for trade dress exists to promote
competition. As we explained just last Term, see <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.
Samara Brothers, Inc., </i>529 U.S. 205, 120 S.Ct. 1339, 146 L.Ed.2d 182
(2000), various Courts of Appeals have allowed claims of trade dress
infringement relying on the general provision of the Lanham Act which provides
a cause of action to one who is injured when a person uses �any word, term
name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof ... which is likely to
cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her
goods.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(A). Congress confirmed this statutory protection
for trade dress by amending the Lanham Act to recognize the concept. Title 15
U.S.C. � 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: �In a civil action for trade
dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the
principal register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the
burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional.�
This burden of proof gives force to the well-established rule that trade dress
protection may not be claimed for product features that are functional. <i>Qualitex,
supra,</i> at 164-165; <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S.
763, 775 (1992). And in <i>Wal-Mart,</i> <i>supra,</i> we were careful to
caution against misuse or overextension of trade dress. We noted that �product
design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification.� <i>Id.,</i>
at 213.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Trade dress protection must subsist with the
recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying
goods and products. In general, unless an intellectual property right such as a
patent or copyright protects an item, it will be subject to copying. As the
Court has explained, copying is not always discouraged or disfavored by the
laws which preserve our competitive economy. <i>Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder
Craft Boats, Inc.,</i> 489 U.S. 141, 160 (1989). Allowing competitors to copy
will have salutary effects in many instances. �Reverse engineering of chemical
and mechanical articles in the public domain often leads to significant
advances in technology.� <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The principal question in this case is the effect
of an expired patent on a claim of trade dress infringement. A prior patent, we
conclude, has vital significance in resolving the trade dress claim. A utility
patent is strong evidence that the features therein claimed are functional. If
trade dress protection is sought for those features the strong evidence of
functionality based on the previous patent adds great weight to the statutory
presumption that features are deemed functional until proved otherwise by the
party seeking trade dress protection. Where the expired patent claimed the
features in question, one who seeks to establish trade dress protection must
carry the heavy burden of showing that the feature is not functional, for
instance by showing that it is merely an ornamental, incidental, or arbitrary
aspect of the device.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the case before us, the central advance claimed
in the expired utility patents (the Sarkisian patents) is the dual-spring
design; and the dual-spring design is the essential feature of the trade dress
MDI now seeks to establish and to protect. The rule we have explained bars the
trade dress claim, for MDI did not, and cannot, carry the burden of overcoming
the strong evidentiary inference of functionality based on the disclosure of
the dual-spring design in the claims of the expired patents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The dual springs shown in the Sarkisian patents
were well apart (at either end of a frame for holding a rectangular sign when
one full side is the base) while the dual springs at issue here are close
together (in a frame designed to hold a sign by one of its corners). As the
District Court recognized, this makes little difference. The point is that the
springs are necessary to the operation of the device. The fact that the springs
in this very different-looking device fall within the claims of the patents is
illustrated by MDI's own position in earlier litigation. In the late 1970's,
MDI engaged in a long-running intellectual property battle with a company known
as Winn-Proof. Although the precise claims of the Sarkisian patents cover sign
stands with springs �spaced apart,� U.S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 4; U.S.
Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 4, the Winn-Proof sign stands (with springs much
like the sign stands at issue here) were found to infringe the patents by the
United States District Court for the District of Oregon, and the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment. <i>Sarkisian v. Winn-Proof
Corp.,</i> 697 F.2d 1313 (1983). Although the Winn-Proof traffic sign stand
(with dual springs close together) did not appear, then, to infringe the
literal terms of the patent claims (which called for �spaced apart� springs),
the Winn-Proof sign stand was found to infringe the patents under the doctrine
of equivalents, which allows a finding of patent infringement even when the
accused product does not fall within the literal terms of the claims. <i>Id.,</i>
at 1321-1322; see generally <i>Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical
Co.,</i> 520 U.S. 17 (1997). In light of this past ruling&#8212;a ruling
procured at MDI's own insistence&#8212;it must be concluded the products here
at issue would have been covered by the claims of the expired patents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a
feature in the claims of a utility patent constitutes strong evidence of
functionality is well illustrated in this case. The dual-spring design serves
the important purpose of keeping the sign upright even in heavy wind
conditions; and, as confirmed by the statements in the expired patents, it does
so in a unique and useful manner. As the specification of one of the patents
recites, prior art �devices, in practice, will topple under the force of a
strong wind.� U.S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 1. The dual-spring design allows
sign stands to resist toppling in strong winds. Using a dual-spring design
rather than a single spring achieves important operational advantages. For
example, the specifications of the patents note that the �use of a pair of
springs ... as opposed to the use of a single spring to support the frame
structure prevents canting or twisting of the sign around a vertical axis,� and
that, if not prevented, twisting �may cause damage to the spring structure and
may result in tipping of the device.� U.S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 3. In the
course of patent prosecution, it was said that �[t]he use of a pair of spring
connections as opposed to a single spring connection ... forms an important
part of this combination� because it �forc[es] the sign frame to tip along the
longitudinal axis of the elongated ground-engaging members.� App. 218. The
dual-spring design affects the cost of the device as well; it was acknowledged
that the device �could use three springs but this would unnecessarily increase
the cost of the device.� <i>Id.,</i> at 217. These statements made in the
patent applications and in the course of procuring the patents demonstrate the
functionality of the design. MDI does not assert that any of these
representations are mistaken or inaccurate, and this is further strong evidence
of the functionality of the dual-spring design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In finding for MDI on the trade dress issue the
Court of Appeals gave insufficient recognition to the importance of the expired
utility patents, and their evidentiary significance, in establishing the
functionality of the device. The error likely was caused by its
misinterpretation of trade dress principles in other respects. As we have
noted, even if there has been no previous utility patent the party asserting
trade dress has the burden to establish the nonfunctionality of alleged trade
dress features. MDI could not meet this burden. Discussing trademarks, we have
said � �[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional,� and cannot serve
as a trademark, �if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if
it affects the cost or quality of the article.� � <i>Qualitex,</i> 514 U.S., at
165 (quoting <i>Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456
U.S. 844, 850, n. 10 (1982)). Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we
have observed that a functional feature is one the �exclusive use of [which]
would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.�
514 U.S., at 165. The Court of Appeals in the instant case seemed to interpret
this language to mean that a necessary test for functionality is �whether the
particular product configuration is a competitive necessity.� 200 F.3d, at 940.
See also <i>Vornado,</i> 58 F.3d, at 1507 (�Functionality, by contrast, has
been defined both by our circuit, and more recently by the Supreme Court, in
terms of competitive need�). This was incorrect as a comprehensive definition.
As explained in <i>Qualitex,</i> <i>supra,</i> and <i>Inwood,</i> <i>supra, </i>a
feature is also functional when it is essential to the use or purpose of the
device or when it affects the cost or quality of the device. The <i>Qualitex</i>
decision did not purport to displace this traditional rule. Instead, it quoted
the rule as <i>Inwood</i> had set it forth. It is proper to inquire into a
�significant non-reputation-related disadvantage� in cases of esthetic
functionality, the question involved in <i>Qualitex.</i> Where the design is
functional under the <i>Inwood</i> formulation there is no need to proceed
further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the feature. In <i>Qualitex,</i>
by contrast, esthetic functionality was the central question, there having been
no indication that the green-gold color of the laundry press pad had any
bearing on the use or purpose of the product or its cost or quality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court has allowed trade dress protection to
certain product features that are inherently distinctive. <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505
U.S., at 774. In <i>Two Pesos,</i> however, the Court at the outset made the
explicit analytic assumption that the trade dress features in question
(decorations and other features to evoke a Mexican theme in a restaurant) were
not functional. <i>Id.,</i> at 767, n. 6. The trade dress in those cases did
not bar competitors from copying functional product design features. In the
instant case, beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the sign
stands are made by MDI (assuming it does so), the dual-spring design provides a
unique and useful mechanism to resist the force of the wind. Functionality having
been established, whether MDI's dual-spring design has acquired secondary
meaning need not be considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no need, furthermore, to engage, as did
the Court of Appeals, in speculation about other design possibilities, such as
using three or four springs which might serve the same purpose. 200 F.3d, at
940. Here, the functionality of the spring design means that competitors need
not explore whether other spring juxtapositions might be used. The dual-spring
design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of MDI's product; it
is the reason the device works. Other designs need not be attempted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the dual-spring design is functional, it is
unnecessary for competitors to explore designs to hide the springs, say, by
using a box or framework to cover them, as suggested by the Court of Appeals. <i>Ibid.</i>
The dual-spring design assures the user the device will work. If buyers are
assured the product serves its purpose by seeing the operative mechanism that
in itself serves an important market need. It would be at cross-purposes to
those objectives, and something of a paradox, were we to require the
manufacturer to conceal the very item the user seeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In a case where a manufacturer seeks to protect
arbitrary, incidental, or ornamental aspects of features of a product found in
the patent claims, such as arbitrary curves in the legs or an ornamental
pattern painted on the springs, a different result might obtain. There the
manufacturer could perhaps prove that those aspects do not serve a purpose
within the terms of the utility patent. The inquiry into whether such features,
asserted to be trade dress, are functional by reason of their inclusion in the
claims of an expired utility patent could be aided by going beyond the claims
and examining the patent and its prosecution history to see if the feature in
question is shown as a useful part of the invention. No such claim is made
here, however. MDI in essence seeks protection for the dual-spring design
alone. The asserted trade dress consists simply of the dual-spring design, four
legs, a base, an upright, and a sign. MDI has pointed to nothing arbitrary
about the components of its device or the way they are assembled. The Lanham
Act does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a
particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of
exclusivity. The Lanham Act, furthermore, does not protect trade dress in a
functional design simply because an investment has been made to encourage the
public to associate a particular functional feature with a single manufacturer
or seller. The Court of Appeals erred in viewing MDI as possessing the right to
exclude competitors from using a design identical to MDI's and to require those
competitors to adopt a different design simply to avoid copying it. MDI cannot
gain the exclusive right to produce sign stands using the dual-spring design by
asserting that consumers associate it with the look of the invention itself.
Whether a utility patent has expired or there has been no utility patent at
all, a product design which has a particular appearance may be functional
because it is �essential to the use or purpose of the article� or �affects the
cost or quality of the article.� <i>Inwood,</i> 456 U.S., at 850, n. 10, 102
S.Ct. 2182.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> TrafFix and some of its <i>amici</i> argue that the
Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, � 8, cl. 8, of its own force,
prohibits the holder of an expired utility patent from claiming trade dress
protection. Brief for Petitioner 33-36; Brief for Panduit Corp. as <i>Amicus
Curiae</i> 3; Brief for Malla Pollack as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 2. We need not
resolve this question. If, despite the rule that functional features may not be
the subject of trade dress protection, a case arises in which trade dress
becomes the practical equivalent of an expired utility patent, that will be
time enough to consider the matter. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court reversed [the Sixth Circuit in <i>TrafFix</i>],

The Court further held that once a product feature is found to be functional

in <i>TrafFix</i> to have altered the <i>Morton&#8211;Norwich</i> analysis. As
noted above, the <i>Morton&#8211;Norwich</i> factors aid in the determination
of whether a particular feature is functional, and the third factor focuses on
the availability of �other alternatives.� <i>Morton&#8211;Norwich</i>, 671 F.2d
at 1341. We did not in the past under the third factor require that the
opposing party establish that there was a �competitive necessity� for the
product feature. Nothing in <i>TrafFix</i> suggests that consideration of
alternative designs is not properly part of the overall mix, and we do not read
the Court's observations in <i>TrafFix</i> as rendering the availability of
alternative designs irrelevant. Rather, we conclude that the Court merely noted
that once a product feature is found functional based on other considerations<a

the availability of alternative designs, because the feature cannot be given
trade dress protection merely because there are alternative designs available.
But that does not mean that the availability of alternative designs cannot be a
legitimate source of evidence to determine whether a feature is functional in
the first place. We find it significant that neither party argues that <i>TrafFix</i>
changed the law of functionality, and that scholarly commentary has reached
exactly the same conclusion that we have:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the author's view, the observations by the Supreme Court
in <i>TrafFix</i> do not mean that the availability of alternative designs

that once a design is found to be functional, it cannot be given trade dress

<p class=OpinionCitation>289 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2002)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>Plaintiff Eppendorf&#8211;Netheler&#8211;Hinz GMBH
(�Eppendorf�) manufactures disposable pipette tips and dispenser syringes to
which the pipette tips can be attached for use in laboratories.&nbsp; Defendant
Ritter GMBH (�Ritter�) began to manufacture pipette tips that were
interchangeable with and priced lower than Eppendorf�s tips.&nbsp; Eppendorf
brought suit against Ritter for, among other things, trade dress
infringement.&nbsp; In June of 2000, ten months before the Supreme Court handed
down </i>TrafFix<i>, Eppendorf�s claims were tried before a jury, which
returned a verdict in favor of Eppendorf.&nbsp; The district court denied
Ritter�s motion for judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Ritter appealed</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Eppendorf contends that Ritter infringed upon eight
elements of the Combitips's trade dress: (1) the flange on top of the tip; (2)
the fins connecting the flange to the body of the tip; (3) the plunger head;
(4) the plunger; (5) the length of the tips; (6) the eight sizes of the tips;
(7) the coloring scheme on the tips; and (8) the angle of the stump on the
tips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The crucial issue presented by this appeal is
whether the eight design elements of the Eppendorf Combitips are functional as
a matter of law. This case was tried in June of 2000, almost ten months before
the Supreme Court decided <i>TrafFix.</i> The district court, correctly
applying this circuit's utilitarian test of functionality, instructed the jury
as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A design or characteristic is nonfunctional if there are
reasonably effective and efficient alternatives possible. Hence, a product's
trade dress is functional only, one, if competitors need to incorporate it in
order to compete effectively because it is essential to the product's use, or,
two, if it significantly affects the cost or quality of the article. A design
is functional and thus unprotectable if it is one of a limited number of
equally efficient options available to competitors and free competition would
be significantly disadvantaged by according the design trademark protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relying on this instruction, the jury determined that the
Combitips were non-functional. Ritter and RK Manufacturing moved for judgment
as a matter of law on the issue of functionality, and the district court denied
the motion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Eppendorf contends that the evidence supports the
jury's finding of non-functionality because �[t]he evidence clearly established
that there were alternative designs to each of the eight non-functional
features.� <i>Appellee's Brief</i> at 20. Indeed, there is extensive testimony
in the record regarding available alternative designs for each of the eight
elements. For example, Eppendorf's expert testified that the number of fins
under the flange �could be increased or decreased or their appearance could be
changed.� <i>Appellee's Brief</i> at 5. Thus, Eppendorf argues that the fins
are non-functional because alternative designs are available to competitors in
the marketplace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Eppendorf's argument, while consistent with this
circuit's utilitarian definition of functionality, is unpersuasive in light of
the Court's discussion of functionality in <i>TrafFix.</i> As explained above,
the primary test for functionality is whether the product feature is essential
to the use or purpose of the product or if it affects the cost or quality of
the product. In <i>TrafFix,</i> the Court determined that the dual-spring
design on a wind-resistant road sign was functional because the dual-spring
design �provides a unique and useful mechanism to resist the force of the
wind.� 532 U.S. at 33, 121 S.Ct. at 1262. The Court rejected the argument that
the springs were non-functional because a competitor could use three or four
springs which would serve the same purpose. <i>Id.</i> The Court explained,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>There is no need, furthermore, to engage, as did the Court
of Appeals, in speculation about other design possibilities, such as using
three or four springs which might serve the same purpose.... The dual-spring
design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of [the road sign]; it
is the reason the device works. Other designs need not be attempted.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 33&#8211;34, 121 S.Ct. at 1261.
Accordingly, the design features for which Eppendorf seeks trade dress rights
are functional if they are essential to the use or purpose of the Combitips or
affect the cost or quality of the Combitips. The availability of alternative
designs is irrelevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case it is undisputed that the Combitips's
fins provide necessary support for the flange. Without the fins, the flange is
subject to deformation. The only testimony offered by Eppendorf to prove
non-functionality of the fins related to the existence of alternative design
possibilities. Eppendorf's functionality expert testified that the appearance
and number of fins could be changed without affecting the function of the fins.
Eppendorf did not prove, however, that the fins are an arbitrary flourish which
serve no purpose in the Combitips. Rather, Eppendorf's experts concede that
fins of some shape, size or number are necessary to provide support for the
flange and to prevent deformation of the product. Thus, the fins are design
elements necessary to the operation of the product.<a href="#_ftn83"
name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[83]</span></span></span></a> Because the fins are
essential to the operation of the Combitips, they are functional as a matter of
law, and it is unnecessary to consider design alternatives available in the
marketplace. <i>TrafFix,</i> 532 U.S. at 33&#8211;34.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Likewise, a careful review of the record
demonstrates that Eppendorf failed to prove that the remaining Combitip design
elements are unnecessary, non-essential design elements. It is undisputed that:
(1) The flange is necessary to connect the Combitip to the dispenser syringe;
(2) The rings on the plunger head are necessary to lock the plunger into a
cylinder in the dispenser syringe; (3) The plunger is necessary to push liquids
out of the tip, and the ribs on the plunger stabilize its action; (4) The tips
at the lower end of the Combitips are designed to easily fit into test tubes
and other receptacles; (5) The size of the Combitip determines the dispensed
volume, and size is essential to accurate and efficient dispensing; (6) The
color scheme used on the Combitip&#8212;clear plastic with black
lettering&#8212;enables the user easily to see and measure the amount of liquid
in the Combitip, and black is standard in the medical industry; and (7) The
stumps of the larger Combitips must be angled to separate air bubbles from the
liquid and ensure that the full volume of liquid is dispensed. Thus, all eight
design elements identified by Eppendorf are essential to the operation of the
Combitips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Eppendorf's theory of non-functionality focused on
the existence of alternative designs. Eppendorf's design expert summarized
Eppendorf's approach to functionality: �My conclusion was that to achieve the
same functional purpose, [the design elements identified by Eppendorf] can be
changed significantly, considerably without affecting the overall intended
purpose.� Although alternative designs are relevant to the utilitarian test of
functionality, alternative designs are not germane to the traditional test for
functionality. Each of the eight design elements identified by Eppendorf is
essential to the use or purpose of the Combitips, and is not arbitrary or
ornamental features. Therefore, no reasonable juror could conclude that
Eppendorf carried its burden of proving non-functionality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sixth Circuit
application of </i>TrafFix.&nbsp; Just as it did with <i>Eppendorf</i> in the
Fifth Circuit, <i>TrafFix</i> directly altered the outcome of a functionality
case being litigated in the Sixth Circuit when <i>TrafFix</i> was handed
down.&nbsp; In <i>Antioch Co. v. Western Trimming Corp</i>., 196 F.Supp.2d 635
(S.D.Ohio 2002), the district court initially found that the plaintiff�s scrap
book design was nonfunctional in light of the availability of alternative
designs, but the court invited the defendant to renew its motion for summary
judgment on the issue if <i>TrafFix</i> altered the legal framework for
assessing trade dress functionality.&nbsp; The defendant did so and the
district court then ruled that the trade dress at issue was functional.&nbsp;
The Sixth Circuit affirmed. &nbsp;See <i>Antioch Co. v. Western Trimming Corp</i>.,
347 F.3d 150, 156-157 (6th Cir. 2003) (�[A] a court is not <i>required</i> to
examine alternative designs when applying the traditional test for
functionality.&nbsp; That much is clear from <i>TrafFix Devices</i>�. The dual
strap-hinge design, spine cover, padded album cover, and reinforced pages are
all components that are essential to the use of Antioch's album and affect its
quality. We thus agree with the district court's conclusion that there was no
genuine issue of material fact regarding the functionality of Antioch's album
under the traditional <i>Inwood</i> test.� (emphasis in original)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Talking Rain owns U.S. Trademark Registration No.
2,181,774, which covers the shape of a bottle that Talking Rain uses in its
sales of flavored and unflavored water. <i>See</i> Appendix A [shown below].
Talking Rain claims that South Beach Beverage Company, Inc., and the South
Beach Beverage Company, LLC (collectively �SoBe�) use a bottle in sales of
beverages that is confusingly similar to Talking Rain's trademarked bottle [See
Appendices B and C]. Talking Rain sued SoBe, claiming trademark infringement
and false designation of origin, in violation of �� 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. �� 1114, 1125(a), and the Washington State Consumer Protection
Act, WASH. REV. CODE � 19.86.020. SoBe counterclaimed, alleging that Talking
Rain's bottle is functional and, accordingly, that its trademark registration
is invalid and should be canceled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[The district court granted SoBe�s summary judgment motion,
finding Talking Rain�s bottle to be functional.&nbsp; Talking Rain appealed.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A trademark is functional �when it is essential to
the use or purpose of the device or when it affects the cost or quality of the
device.� <i>TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 23, 33
(2001) (discussing the �traditional rule� set forth in <i>Inwood Labs., Inc. v.
Ives Labs., Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 850 n. 10). To determine whether a product
feature is functional, this circuit typically considers four factors: (1)
whether advertising touts the utilitarian advantages of the design, (2) whether
the particular design results from a comparatively simple or inexpensive method
of manufacture, (3) whether the design yields a utilitarian advantage and (4)
whether alternative designs are available. <i>See Disc Golf Ass'n v. Champion
Discs, Inc.,</i> 158 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir.1998).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In applying the <i>Disc Golf</i> factors, we are
mindful of the Supreme Court's recent pronouncement that once functionality is
established, �[t]here is no need ... to engage ... in speculation about other
design possibilities....� <i>TrafFix,</i> 532 U.S. at 33. Therefore, the
existence of alternative designs cannot negate a trademark's functionality. But
the existence of alternative designs may indicate whether the trademark itself
embodies functional or merely ornamental aspects of the product. <i>See id.</i>
at 34.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The evidence in this case, even when viewed in the
light most favorable to Talking Rain, establishes that Talking Rain's trademark
is functional. First, Talking Rain's advertising touts its bottle's utilitarian
features. Talking Rain, which refers to its bottle as the �Grip Bottle,� argues
that its �Get a Grip!� slogan involves a double-meaning because the slogan is a
slang expression meaning �get in control.� No matter the plausibility of
Talking Rain's �double-entendre� argument, at least one meaning of its
advertising is that the bottle is easy to grip. We are not required to ignore
advertising that touts functional features just because those ads may include
messages-subtle or otherwise-aimed at nonfunctional features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, Talking Rain has acknowledged that
manufacturing considerations explain why its bottle looks the way it does. In
particular, the grip feature, aside from making the bottle easier to hold,
offers structural support. Talking Rain misunderstands the functionality
inquiry in contending that manufacturing considerations cut against a finding
of functionality because the bottle was costly to design. Through its
investment, Talking Rain learned that by adding a recessed/ grip area, it could
manufacture a plastic bottle with curved sides that would not collapse. Talking
Rain's initiative is commendable, but to the extent its product design is
functional, trademark law does not prohibit SoBe from also using this efficient
manufacturing process. <i>See Tie Tech,</i> 296 F.3d at 785(�The requirement of
nonfunctionality is based on the judicial theory that <i>there exists a
fundamental right to compete through imitation of a competitor's product,</i>
which right can only be <i>temporarily</i> denied by the patent or copyright
laws.�) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original); <i>Leatherman
Tool Group, Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir.1999)
(�[I]t is not the purpose of unfair competition law, under the guise of either
consumer protection or the protection of business good will, to implement a
policy of encouraging innovative designs by protecting them once designed.�)
(internal quotation marks omitted). On the contrary, that the grip feature
reflects a comparatively simple method of manufacturing a structurally sound
bottle indicates that the trademarked bottle is functional. <i>See Disc Golf
Ass'n,</i> 158 F.3d at 1009(�A functional benefit may arise if �the design
achieves economies in manufacture or use.�� (quoting <i>Int'l Jensen, Inc. v.
Metrosound U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 4 F.3d 819, 823 (9th Cir.1993))).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Third, the bike bottle design yields a utilitarian
advantage. SoBe contends that the bottle fits easily into a bicycle bottle
holder and that the grip area helps the bottle to retain its shape for reuse.
SoBe also contends that the grip area makes the bottle easier to grip,
particularly for bicyclists and others who might use the bottle while
exercising. <i>See Nora Beverages, Inc. v. Perrier Group of Am., Inc.,</i> 269
F.3d 114, 120 n. 4 (2d Cir.2001) (the waist/recessed area of a 1.5 liter water
bottle �creates a very useful groove into which a thumb and forefinger can rest
comfortably while at the same time providing a more secure grip of a relatively
heavy bottle�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Talking Rain does not dispute these contentions.
Instead, Talking Rain argues that its trademarked design is merely one of a
number of possible designs for bike bottles. According to Talking Rain, SoBe
could have achieved the same functionality by adopting a bike bottle design
other than the design embodied by Talking Rain's trademark. But under the
Supreme Court's decision in <i>TrafFix,</i> the mere existence of alternatives
does not render a product nonfunctional. <i>See</i> 532 U.S. at 33-34.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, Talking Rain's advertising emphasizes
functionality, the bottle's shape is motivated by manufacturing efficiencies
and the bottle itself offers utilitarian advantages that non-bike bottles do
not possess.<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[84]</span></span></span></a>
Moreover, that recessed/grip areas appear to be common in the beverage industry
tends to corroborate SoBe's assertion that the grip area is indeed functional
and not arbitrary. Talking Rain points to no distinctive feature shared by
Talking Rain's and SoBe's bottles, beyond the functional grip area. <i>See Tie
Tech,</i> 296 F.3d at 786. In short, the functional grip area <i>is</i> the
essence of Talking Rain's claimed distinctiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first three <i>Disc Golf</i> factors support
the district court's finding that Talking Rain's trademark is functional. Under
<i>TrafFix,</i> the existence of alternative designs does not diminish these
indicia of functionality. SoBe has overcome the presumption of nonfunctionality
created by Talking Rain's trademark registration.<a href="#_ftn85"
name="_ftnref85" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[85]</span></span></span></a> Thus, we conclude that the
district court correctly found that Talking Rain's trademark is functional and
therefore invalid. The district court correctly granted summary judgment to
SoBe on the federal and state law claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The [district] judge found that [Clarin�s] x-frame
construction is functional because it was designed to be an optimal tradeoff
between a chair's weight (and thus its cost, since lighter chairs use less
steel) and its strength; an x-frame chair also folds itself naturally when
knocked over (an important consideration for large auditoriums, where it is
vital that chairs not impede exit if a fire or panic breaks out); the flat
channel at the seat's edge, where the attachment to the frame slides so that
the chair can fold, was designed for strength and attaching hooks to link a
chair with its nearest neighbor; the front and back cross bars contribute
strength (and allow thinner tubing to be used in the rest of the frame); and
the inward-sloping frame of the back support allows the chair to support
greater vertical loads than Clarin's older �a-back� design, which the �b-back�
design, depicted in the trademark registration, succeeded. The a-back design is
on the left and the b-back on the right:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:black'><img border=0 width=191 height=74 id="_x0000_i1069"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Clarin chairs with a-back designs failed when the
audience at rock concerts, seeking a better view, sat on top of the chairs'
backs and put their feet on the seats. The tubing buckled at the bend in the
frame. The b-back design is less likely to buckle when someone sits on it, and
it also produces a somewhat wider back, which concert promoters see as a
benefit. (Patrons sometimes try to get closer to the stage by stepping through
rows of chairs. The gap between b-back chairs is smaller, so they are more
effective at keeping crowds in place.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Having concluded not only that the overall design
of Clarin's chair is functional, but also that each feature is functional, the
district judge added that Clarin had defrauded the Patent and Trademark Office
by giving misleadingly incomplete answers to the trademark examiner's
questions. The examiner initially turned down Clarin's proposal to register the
design as a trademark, observing that the design appeared to be functional.
Clarin replied that the design was chosen for aesthetic rather than functional
reasons. (This was not a complete answer, as attractiveness is a <i>kind</i> of
function. See <i>Jay Franco &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Franek,</i> 615 F.3d 855,
860&#8211;61 (7th Cir. 2010). But we need not pursue that subject.) Clarin
observed that a patent it held on an x-frame chair, No. 1,943,058, issued in
1934, did not include all of the features in the mark's design. What Clarin did
not tell the examiner is that it held three other patents on x-frame designs:
No. 1,600,248, issued in 1926; No. 2,137,803, issued in 1938; and No.
3,127,218, issued in 1964. The district judge concluded that the four patents
collectively cover every feature of the design submitted for a trademark except
the b-back, and that as the b-back is a functional improvement over the a-back
Clarin should have disclosed all of these utility patents. Had it done so, the
judge thought, the examiner would have refused to register the proposed mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district judge started from the proposition,
which the Supreme Court articulated in <i>TrafFix,</i> that claims in an
expired utility patent presumptively are functional. Since utility patents are
supposed to be restricted to inventions that have utility, and thus are
functional, that's a sensible starting point&#8212;and since inventions covered
by utility patents pass into the public domain when the patent expires, it is
inappropriate to use trademark law to afford extended protection to a patented
invention. See also <i>Jay Franco,</i> 615 F.3d at 857&#8211;59. Clarin itself
obtained four utility patents for aspects of the x-frame folding chair. These
patents disclose every aspect of the asserted trademark design except for the
b-back. And the district judge did not commit a clear error by concluding that
the b-back design is a functional improvement over the a-back design. This
means that the trademark design is functional as a unit, and that every
important aspect of it is independently functional. It looks the way it does in
order to be a better chair, not in order to be a better way of identifying who
made it (the function of a trademark).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We do not doubt that there are many other available
functional designs. Sometimes the function of the functionality doctrine is to
prevent firms from appropriating basic forms (such as the circle) that go into
many designs. Our contemporaneous opinion in <i>Jay Franco</i><a href="#_ftn86"
name="_ftnref86" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[86]</span></span></span></span></a> discusses that aspect
of the functionality doctrine. This does not imply that preserving basic
elements for the public domain is the doctrine's <i>only</i> role.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Another goal, as <i>TrafFix</i> stressed, is to
separate the spheres of patent and trademark law, and to ensure that the term
of a patent is not extended beyond the period authorized by the legislature. A
design such as Clarin's x-frame chair is functional not because it is the only
way to do things, but because it represents one of many solutions to a problem.
Clarin tells us that other designs are stronger, or thinner, or less likely to
collapse when someone sits on the backrest, or lighter and so easier to carry
and set up. Granted. But as Clarin's '248 patent states, the x-frame design
achieves a favorable strength-to-weight ratio. Plastic chairs are lighter but
weaker. Y-frame chairs are stronger but use more metal (and so are heavier and
more expensive); some alternative designs must be made with box-shaped metal
pieces to achieve strength, and this adds to weight and the cost of
fabrication. The list of alternative designs is very long, and it is easy to
see why hundreds of different-looking folding chairs are on the market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> What this says to us is that <i>all</i> of the
designs are functional, in the sense that they represent different compromises
along the axes of weight, strength, kind of material, ease of setup, ability to
connect (�gang�) the chairs together for maximum seating density, and so on. A
novel or distinctive selection of attributes on these many dimensions can be
protected for a time by a utility patent or a design patent, but it cannot be
protected forever as one producer's trade dress. When the patent expires, other
firms are free to copy the design to the last detail in order to increase
competition and drive down the price that consumers pay. See, e.g., <i>Bonito
Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,</i> 489 U.S. 141(1989); <i>Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.,</i> 376 U.S. 225 (1964)�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the district court did not commit clear
error in finding Clarin's design to be functional, it is unnecessary to decide
whether Clarin committed fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office�.</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009953"><a name="_Toc365461074">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aesthetic
Functionality</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Supreme Court briefly explained in <i>TrafFix</i>, a
product (or packaging) feature that performs no technical, mechanical function
may nevertheless be barred from protection on the ground that it is
�aesthetically functional.�&nbsp; Under <i>TrafFix</i>, the test to determine
whether a product feature is aesthetically functional is not the <i>Inwood</i>
test.&nbsp; Instead, courts should ask whether there are more than a limited
range of alternative designs available to competitors such that exclusive
rights in the product feature would not put competitors at a significant
non-reputation-related competitive disadvantage.&nbsp; What might have prompted
courts to abandon the <i>Inwood</i> test in the aesthetic functionality
context?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few classic illustrations of aesthetically functional
product configuration from the <i>Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition</i>
may help to convey the general idea of aesthetic functionality:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>8.&nbsp; A is the first seller to
market candy intended for Valentine's Day in heart-shaped boxes. Evidence establishes
that the shape of the box is an important factor in the appeal of the product
to a significant number of consumers. Because there are no alternative designs
capable of satisfying the aesthetic desires of these prospective purchasers,
the design of the box is functional�.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>9. A manufactures outdoor lighting
fixtures intended for mounting on the walls of commercial buildings to
illuminate adjacent areas. The evidence establishes that architectural
compatibility with the building is an important factor in the purchase of such
fixtures and that A's product is considered to be aesthetically compatible with
contemporary architecture. The evidence also establishes that only a limited
number of designs are considered compatible with the type of buildings on which
A's product is used. Because of the limited range of alternative designs
available to competitors, a court may properly conclude that the design of the
lighting fixture is functional under the rule stated in this Section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of the three opinions that follow, <i>Pagliero v. Wallace

proposed a definition of aesthetic functionality that, when interpreted
loosely, could end up prohibiting the protection of anything that was �an
important ingredient in the commercial success of the product,� including the
trademark itself.&nbsp; In <i>Wallace Int'l Silversmiths, Inc. v. Godinger

outsole (the underside) of shoes was aesthetically functional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that not all circuits are receptive to the concept of
aesthetic functionality.&nbsp; See, e.g., <i>Bd. of Supervisors for La. State

<p class=NormalNoIndent>ORR, Circuit Judge</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tepco's use of the designs in question cannot be
enjoined even though it be assumed that Wallace can establish secondary meaning
for them. Imitation of the physical details and designs of a competitor's
product may be actionable, if the particular features imitated are
�non-functional� and have acquired a secondary meaning. <i>Crescent Tool Co. v.
Kilborn &amp; Bishop Co</i>., 2 Cir., 1917, 247 F. 299. But, where the features
are �functional� there is normally no right to relief. �Functional� in this
sense might be said to connote other than a trade-mark purpose. If the
particular feature is an important ingredient in the commercial success of the
product, the interest in free competition permits its imitation in the absence
of a patent or copyright. On the other hand, where the feature or, more aptly,
design, is a mere arbitrary embellishment, a form of dress for the goods
primarily adopted for purposes of identification and individuality and, hence,
unrelated to basic consumer demands in connection with the product, imitation
may be forbidden where the requisite showing of secondary meaning is made.
Under such circumstances, since effective competition may be undertaken without
imitation, the law grants protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These criteria require the classification of the
designs in question here as functional. Affidavits introduced by Wallace repeat
over and over again that one of the essential selling features of hotel china,
if, indeed, not the primary, is the design. The attractiveness and eye-appeal
of the design sells the china. Moreover, from the standpoint of the purchaser
china satisfies a demand for the aesthetic as well as for the utilitarian, and
the design on china is, at least in part, the response to such demand. The
granting of relief in this type of situation would render Wallace immune from
the most direct and effective competition with regard to these lines of china.
It seems clear that these designs are not merely indicia of source, as that one
who copies them can have no real purpose other than to trade on his
competitor's reputation. On the contrary, to imitate is to compete in this type
of situation. Of course, Tepco can also compete by developing designs even more
aesthetically satisfying, but the possibility that an alternative product might
be developed has never been considered a barrier to permitting imitation
competition in other types of cases. The law encourages competition not only in
creativeness but in economy of manufacture and distribution as well. Hence, the
design being a functional feature of the china, we find it unnecessary to
inquire into the adequacy of the showing made as to secondary meaning of the
designs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The Ninth Circuit ordered the district court�s
injunction to be modified to remove all reference to Tepco�s use of designs
similar to Wallace�s</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Wallace International Silversmiths (�Wallace�)
appeals from Judge Haight's denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction
under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) (1988), prohibiting
Godinger Silver Art Co., Inc. (�Godinger�) from marketing a line of silverware
with ornamentation that is substantially similar to Wallace's GRANDE BAROQUE
line. Judge Haight held that the GRANDE BAROQUE design is �a functional feature
of �Baroque� style silverware� and thus not subject to protection as a
trademark. We affirm.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent align=center style='text-align:center'>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Wallace, a Delaware corporation, has sold sterling
silver products for over one hundred years. Its GRANDE BAROQUE pattern was
introduced in 1941 and is still one of the best-selling silverware lines in
America. Made of fine sterling silver, a complete place setting costs several
thousand dollars. Total sales of GRANDE BAROQUE silverware have exceeded fifty
million dollars. The GRANDE BAROQUE pattern is fairly described as �ornate,
massive and flowery [with] indented, flowery roots and scrolls and curls along
the side of the shaft, and flower arrangements along the front of the shaft.�
Wallace owns a trademark registration for the GRANDE BAROQUE name as applied to
sterling silver flatware and hollowware. The GRANDE BAROQUE design is not
patented, but on December 11, 1989, Wallace filed an application for trademark
registration for the GRANDE BAROQUE pattern. This application is still pending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Godinger, a New York corporation, is a manufacturer
of silver-plated products. The company has recently begun to market a line of
baroque-style silver-plated serving pieces. The suggested retail price of the
set of four serving pieces is approximately twenty dollars. Godinger advertised
its new line under the name 20TH CENTURY BAROQUE and planned to introduce it at
the Annual New York Tabletop and Accessories Show, the principal industry trade
show at which orders for the coming year are taken. Like Wallace's silverware,
Godinger's pattern contains typical baroque elements including an indented
root, scrolls, curls, and flowers. The arrangement of these elements
approximates Wallace's design in many ways, although their dimensions are
noticeably different. The most obvious difference between the two designs is
that the Godinger pattern extends further down the handle than the Wallace
pattern does. The Wallace pattern also tapers from the top of the handle to the
stem while the Godinger pattern appears bulkier overall and maintains its bulk
throughout the decorated portion of the handle. Although the record does not
disclose the exact circumstances under which Godinger's serving pieces were
created, Godinger admits that its designers were �certainly inspired by and
aware of [the Wallace] design when [they] created [the 20TH CENTURY BAROQUE]
design.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the afternoon of April 23, 1990, Leonard
Florence of Wallace learned from a wholesale customer, Michael C. Fina Company,
that Godinger had placed an advertisement for its 20TH CENTURY BAROQUE serving
pieces in an industry trade magazine. George Fina, the company's president,
said that he was �confused� when he saw what he believed to be a pattern
identical to GRANDE BAROQUE being advertised by another company. He asked Mr.
Florence whether Wallace had licensed the design to Godinger or whether �the
Godinger product was simply a �knock-off.� � Two days after this conversation,
Wallace filed the complaint in the instant matter stating various federal
trademark and state unfair competition claims. Wallace also filed a motion for
a temporary restraining order and sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting
Godinger from using the mark 20TH CENTURY BAROQUE or infringing the trade dress
of Wallace's GRANDE BAROQUE product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Due to the imminence of the trade show, the
district court held a hearing on Wallace's application for preliminary relief the
day after Wallace had filed its complaint. The record consisted of affidavits
from Florence and Fina reciting the facts described <i>supra,</i> samples of
the Wallace and Godinger pieces, and various photographs and catalogue
illustrations of silverware from other manufacturers. Later that day, Judge
Haight issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order in which he concluded that the
GRANDE BAROQUE design was a �functional� feature of baroque-style silverware
and thus ineligible for trade dress protection under Section 43(a) of the
Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judge Haight found that the similarities between
the Godinger and Wallace designs involved elements common to all baroque-style
designs used in the silverware market. He noted that many manufacturers compete
in that market with such designs and found that �[t]he �Baroque� curls, roots
and flowers are not �mere indicia of source.� Instead, they are requirements to
compete in the silverware market.� Judge Haight concluded that �the �Grande
Baroque� design is a functional feature of �Baroque� style silverware,� relying
on <i>Pagliero v. Wallace China Co.,</i> 198 F.2d 339 (9th Cir.1952).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although we agree with Judge Haight's decision, we
do not endorse his reliance upon <i>Pagliero.</i> That decision allowed a
competitor to sell exact copies of china bearing a particular pattern without
finding that comparably attractive patterns were not available to the
competitor. It based its holding solely on the ground that the particular
pattern was an important ingredient in the commercial success of the china. <i>Id.</i>
at 343&#8211;44. We rejected <i>Pagliero</i> in <i>LeSportsac, Inc. v. K Mart
Corp.</i><span>, 754 F.2d 71 (2d Cir.1985)</span>, and reiterate that rejection
here. Under <i>Pagliero,</i> the commercial success of an aesthetic feature
automatically destroys all of the originator's trademark interest in it,
notwithstanding the feature's secondary meaning and the lack of any evidence
that competitors cannot develop non-infringing, attractive patterns. By
allowing the copying of an exact design without any evidence of market
foreclosure, the <i>Pagliero</i> test discourages both originators and later
competitors from developing pleasing designs. <i>See Keene Corp. v. Paraflex
Industries, Inc.,</i> 653 F.2d 822, 824&#8211;25 (3d Cir.1981).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our rejection of <i>Pagliero,</i> however, does not
call for reversal. Quite unlike <i>Pagliero,</i> Judge Haight found in the
instant matter that there is a substantial market for baroque silverware and
that effective competition in that market requires �use [of] essentially the
same scrolls and flowers� as are found on Wallace's silverware. Based on the
record at the hearing, that finding is not clearly erroneous and satisfies the
requirement of <i>Stormy Clime Ltd. v. Progroup, Inc., </i><span>809 F.2d 971
(2d Cir.1987),<i> </i></span>that a design feature not be given trade dress
protection where use of that feature is necessary for effective competition. <i>Id</i>.
at 976&#8211;77.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our only hesitation in holding that the
functionality doctrine applies is based on nomenclature. �Functionality� seems
to us to imply only utilitarian considerations and, as a legal doctrine, to be
intended only to prevent competitors from obtaining trademark protection for
design features that are necessary to the use or efficient production of the
product. <i>See Keene, supra</i> at 825 (�inquiry should focus on the extent to
which the design feature is related to the utilitarian function of the product
or feature�). Even when the doctrine is referred to as �aesthetic�
functionality, it still seems an apt description only of pleasing designs of
utilitarian features. Nevertheless, there is no lack of language in caselaw endorsing
use of the defense of aesthetic functionality where trademark protection for
purely ornamental features would exclude competitors from a market. <i>See,
e.g., Rogers, supra</i> at 347 (�Though a producer does not lose a design
trademark just because the public finds it pleasing, there may come a point
where the design feature is so important to the value of the product to
consumers that continued trademark protection would deprive them of competitive
alternatives [.]�) (Posner, J.)�. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We put aside our quibble over doctrinal
nomenclature, however, because we are confident that whatever secondary meaning
Wallace's baroque silverware pattern may have acquired, Wallace may not exclude
competitors from using those baroque design elements necessary to compete in
the market for baroque silverware. It is a first principle of trademark law
that an owner may not use the mark as a means of excluding competitors from a
substantial market. Where a mark becomes the generic term to describe an
article, for example, trademark protection ceases. 15 U.S.C. � 1064(3) (1988); <i>see
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.,</i> 537 F.2d 4 (2d
Cir.1976). Where granting trademark protection to the use of certain colors would
tend to exclude competitors, such protection is also limited. <i>See First
Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc.,</i> 809 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir.1987); J.
McCarthy, <i>Trademarks and Unfair Competition,</i> � 7:16 <i>et seq.</i>
Finally, as discussed <i>supra,</i> design features of products that are

functionality doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the instant matter, Wallace seeks trademark
protection, not for a precise expression of a decorative style, but for basic
elements of a style that is part of the public domain. As found by the district
court, these elements are important to competition in the silverware market. We
perceive no distinction between a claim to exclude all others from use on
silverware of basic elements of a decorative style and claims to generic names,
basic colors or designs important to a product's utility. In each case,
trademark protection is sought, not just to protect an owner of a mark in
informing the public of the source of its products, but also to exclude
competitors from producing similar products. We therefore abandon our quibble
with the aesthetic functionality doctrine's nomenclature and adopt the Draft
Restatement's view that, where an ornamental feature is claimed as a trademark
and trademark protection would significantly hinder competition by limiting the
range of adequate alternative designs, the aesthetic functionality doctrine
denies such protection. <i>See</i> Third Restatement of the Law, Unfair
Competition (Preliminary Draft No. 3), Ch. 3, � 17(c) at 213&#8211;14. This
rule avoids the overbreadth of <i>Pagliero</i> by requiring a finding of
foreclosure of alternatives<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span

while still ensuring that trademark protection does not exclude competitors
from substantial markets.<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Of course, if Wallace were able to show secondary
meaning in a precise expression of baroque style, competitors might be excluded
from using an identical or virtually identical design. In such a case, numerous
alternative baroque designs would still be available to competitors. Although
the Godinger design at issue here was found by Judge Haight to be
�substantially similar,� it is not identical or virtually identical, and the
similarity involves design elements necessary to compete in the market for
baroque silverware. Because according trademark protection to those elements
would significantly hinder competitors by limiting the range of adequate
alternative designs, we agree with Judge Haight's denial of a preliminary
injunction.</p>

�Functionality� Defense</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the Supreme Court observed in <i>Qualitex,</i>
aspects of a product that are �functional� generally �cannot serve as a
trademark.� <i>Id.</i> at 165. We have observed that �[t]he doctrine of
functionality prevents trademark law from inhibiting legitimate competition by
giving monopoly control to a producer over a useful product.� <i>Nora
Beverages, Inc.,</i> 269 F.3d at 120 n. 4; <i>see Genesee Brewing Co.,</i> 124
F.3d at 145 n. 5 (it is a �fundamental principle of trademark law that a
trademark ... does not grant a monopoly of production�). This is so because
functional features can be protected only through the patent system, which
grants a limited monopoly over such features until they are released into
general use (typically after either 14 or 20 years, depending on the type of
patent). <i>See Fabrication Enters., Inc.,</i> 64 F.3d at 58&#8211;59 &amp; n.
4 (�The Lanham Act is not concerned with protecting innovation by giving the
innovator a monopoly, which is the function of patent law.�); <i>Stormy Clime,</i>
809 F.2d at 977&#8211;78 (�Courts must proceed with caution in assessing claims
to unregistered trademark protection in the design of products so as not to
undermine the objectives of the patent laws.... Since trademark protection
extends for an unlimited period, expansive trade dress protection for the
design of products would prevent some functional products from enriching the
public domain.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted above, two forms of the functionality
doctrine are relevant to us today: �traditional� or �utilitarian�
functionality, and �aesthetic� functionality. Both forms serve as an
affirmative defense to a trademark infringement claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>A. �Traditional� or �Utilitarian� Functionality</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> According to our traditional understanding of
functionality, a product feature is considered to be �functional� in a
utilitarian sense<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[89]</span></span></span></a>
if it is (1) �essential to the use or purpose of the article,� or if it (2)
�affects the cost or quality of the article.� <i>Inwood Labs.,</i> 456 U.S. at
850 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 2182. A feature is essential ��if [it] is dictated by the
functions to be performed�� by the article. <i>LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart
Corp.,</i> 754 F.2d 71, 76 (2d Cir.1985) (quoting <i>Warner Bros. Inc. v. Gay
Toys Inc.,</i> 724 F.2d 327, 331 (2d Cir.1983)).<a href="#_ftn90"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[90]</span></span></span></a> It affects the cost or
quality of the article where it ��permits the article to be manufactured at a
lower cost� or �constitutes an improvement in the operation of the goods.��<a

font-family:Cambria'>[91]</span></span></span></a> <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Warner
Bros., Inc.,</i> 724 F.2d at 331). A finding that a product feature is
functional according to the <i>Inwood</i> test will ordinarily render the
feature ineligible for trademark protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>B. �Aesthetic Functionality�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Generally, �[w]here [a product's] design is
functional under the <i>Inwood</i> formulation there is no need to proceed
further.� <i>TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.,</i> 532 U.S.
23, 33 (2001) (�<i>TrafFix</i> �). Nevertheless, as the Supreme Court had held
in 1995 in <i>Qualitex,</i> when the aesthetic design of a product is <i>itself</i>
the mark for which protection is sought, we may also deem the mark functional
if giving the markholder the right to use it exclusively �would put competitors
at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage,� <i>Qualitex,</i> 514
U.S. at 165. This remains true even if there is �no indication that [the mark
has] any bearing on the use or purpose of the product or its cost or quality.� <i>TrafFix</i>,
532 U.S. at 33; <i>see Landscape Forms, Inc. v. Colum. Cascade Co.,</i> 70 F.3d
251, 253 (2d Cir.1995) (when evaluating design trademarks we consider whether
�certain features of the design are essential to effective competition in [the]
particular market�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As set forth below, the test for aesthetic
functionality is threefold: At the start, we address the two prongs of the <i>Inwood</i>
test, asking whether the design feature is either �essential to the use or
purpose� or �affects the cost or quality� of the product at issue. Next, if
necessary, we turn to a third prong, which is the competition inquiry set forth
in <i>Qualitex.</i> In other words, if a design feature would, from a
traditional utilitarian perspective, be considered �essential to the use or
purpose� of the article, or to affect its cost or quality, then the design
feature is functional under <i>Inwood</i> and our inquiry ends.<a href="#_ftn92"
name="_ftnref92" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[92]</span></span></span></a> But if the design feature is
not �functional� from a traditional perspective, it must still pass the
fact-intensive <i>Qualitex</i> test and be shown not to have a significant
effect on competition in order to receive trademark protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>i. The Development of the Aesthetic Functionality
Doctrine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the theory of aesthetic functionality was
proposed as early as 1938,<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[93]</span></span></span></a>
the first court to adopt the theory as the basis for denial of protection of a
design was the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <i>Pagliero
v. Wallace China Co.,</i> 198 F.2d 339 (9th Cir.1952). In <i>Pagliero,</i> the
Court of Appeals determined that the Wallace China Company was not entitled to
the exclusive use of a particular floral design on hotel china, despite its
�creat[ion of] a substantial market for its products bearing these designs by
virtue of extensive advertising.� <i>Id.</i> at 340. The design, the Court
held, was �functional� because it satisfied �a demand for the aesthetic as well
as for the utilitarian.� <i>Id.</i> at 343&#8211;44. Because the �particular
feature is an <i>important ingredient</i> in the commercial success of the
product, the interest in free competition permits its imitation in the absence
of a patent or copyright.� <i>Id.</i> at 343 (emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Despite its apparent counterintuitiveness (how can
the purely aesthetic be deemed functional, one might ask?), our Court has long
accepted the doctrine of aesthetic functionality. <i>See, e.g., Warner Bros.,
Inc.,</i> 724 F.2d at 329&#8211;32 (distinctive color and symbols on toy car
were not functional, and so were protectable as trade dress).<a href="#_ftn94"
name="_ftnref94" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[94]</span></span></span></a> We have rejected, however,
the circular �important ingredient� test formulated by the <i>Pagliero</i>
court, which inevitably penalized markholders for their success in promoting
their product.<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[95]</span></span></span></a>
Instead, we have concluded that �Lanham Act protection does not extend to
configurations of ornamental features which would <i>significantly</i> limit
the range of competitive designs available.� <i>Coach Leatherware Co. v. AnnTaylor,
Inc.,</i> 933 F.2d 162, 171 (2d Cir.1991) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we
have held that the doctrine of aesthetic functionality bars protection of a
mark that is �necessary to compete in the [relevant] market.� <i>Villeroy &amp;
Boch Keramische Werke K.G. v. THC Sys., Inc.,</i> 999 F.2d 619, 622 (2d
Cir.1993).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>ii. A Modern Formulation of the Aesthetic Functionality
Doctrine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1995, the Supreme Court in <i>Qualitex</i> gave
its imprimatur to the aesthetic functionality doctrine, holding that �[t]he
ultimate test of aesthetic functionality ... is whether the recognition of
trademark rights [in an aesthetic design feature] would significantly hinder
competition.� <i>Qualitex,</i> 514 U.S. at 170 (quoting Restatement (Third) of
Unfair Competition � 17, cmt. c, at 176 (1993)) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Six years later, reiterating its <i>Qualitex</i> analysis, the
Supreme Court in <i>TrafFix</i> declared that where �[a]esthetic functionality
[is] the central question,� courts must �inquire� as to whether recognizing the
trademark �would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related
disadvantage.� <i>TrafFix,</i> 532 U.S. at 32&#8211;33.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although we have not recently had occasion to apply
the doctrine of aesthetic functionality thus enunciated by the Supreme Court,
it is clear that the combined effect of <i>Qualitex</i> and <i>TrafFix</i> was
to validate the aesthetic functionality doctrine as it had already been
developed by this Court in cases including <i>Wallace International
Silversmiths, Stormy Clime,</i> and <i>LeSportsac. See Yurman Design, Inc.,</i>
262 F.3d at 116 (confirming, five months after the <i>TrafFix</i> decision,
that a putative design trademark is �aesthetic[ally] functional[ ],� and therefore
barred from trademark protection, if granting �the right to use [the mark]
exclusively �would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related
disadvantage� � (quoting <i>TrafFix,</i> 532 U.S. at 32)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the one hand, ��[w]here an ornamental feature is
claimed as a trademark and trademark protection would significantly hinder
competition by limiting the range of adequate alternative designs, the
aesthetic functionality doctrine denies such protection.�� <i>Forschner Grp.,
Inc. v. Arrow Trading Co.,</i> 124 F.3d 402, 409&#8211;10 (2d Cir.1997)
(quoting <i>Wallace Int'l Silversmiths, Inc.,</i> 916 F.2d at 81). But on the
other hand, ��distinctive and arbitrary arrangements of predominantly
ornamental features that do <i>not</i> hinder potential competitors from
entering the same market with differently dressed versions of the product are
non-functional[,] and [are] hence eligible for [trademark protection].�� <i>Fabrication
Enters., Inc.,</i> 64 F.3d at 59 (quoting <i>Stormy Clime,</i> 809 F.2d at 977)
(emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In short, a mark is aesthetically functional, and
therefore ineligible for protection under the Lanham Act, where protection of
the mark <i>significantly</i> undermines competitors' ability to compete in the
relevant market. <i>See Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd.,</i> 71 F.3d 996,
1006 (2d Cir.1995) (linking aesthetic functionality to availability of
alternative designs for children's fall-themed sweaters); <i>Landscape Forms,
Inc.,</i> 70 F.3d at 253 (holding that �in order for a court to find a product
design functional, it must first find that certain features of the design are
essential to effective competition in a particular market�). In making this
determination, courts must carefully weigh �the competitive benefits of
protecting the source-identifying aspects� of a mark against the �competitive
costs of precluding competitors from using the feature.� <i>Fabrication
Enters., Inc.,</i> 64 F.3d at 59.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, we note that a product feature's
successful source indication can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the
feature's aesthetic function, if any. <i>See, e.g., Jay Franco &amp; Sons, Inc.
v. Franek,</i> 615 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir.2010) (noting that �[f]iguring out
which designs [produce a benefit other than source identification] can be
tricky�). Therefore, in determining whether a mark has an aesthetic function so
as to preclude trademark protection, we take care to ensure that the mark's
very success in denoting (and promoting) its source does not itself defeat the
markholder's right to protect that mark. <i>See Wallace Int'l Silversmiths,
Inc.,</i> 916 F.2d at 80 (rejecting argument that �the commercial success of an
aesthetic feature automatically destroys all of the originator's trademark
interest in it, notwithstanding the feature's secondary meaning and the lack of
any evidence that competitors cannot develop non-infringing, attractive
patterns�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because aesthetic function and branding success can
sometimes be difficult to distinguish, the aesthetic functionality analysis is
highly fact-specific. In conducting this inquiry, courts must consider both the
markholder's right to enjoy the benefits of its effort to distinguish its
product and the public's right to the �vigorously competitive market [ ]�
protected by the Lanham Act, which an overly broad trademark might hinder. <i>Yurman
Design, Inc.,</i> 262 F.3d at 115 (internal quotation mark omitted). In sum,
courts must avoid jumping to the conclusion that an aesthetic feature is
functional merely because it denotes the product's desirable source. <i>Cf.
Pagliero,</i> 198 F.2d at 343.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>iii. Aesthetic Functionality in the Fashion Industry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We now turn to the <i>per se</i> rule of
functionality for color marks in the fashion industry adopted by the District
Court&#8212;a rule that would effectively deny trademark protection to any
deployment of a single color in an item of apparel. As noted above, the <i>Qualitex</i>
Court expressly held that �sometimes [ ] a color will meet ordinary legal
trademark requirements[, a]nd, when it does so, no special legal rule prevents
color alone from serving as a trademark.� <i>Qualitex,</i> 514 U.S. at 161, 115
S.Ct. 1300. In other words, the Supreme Court specifically forbade the
implementation of a <i>per se</i> rule that would deny protection for the use
of a single color as a trademark in a particular industrial context. <i>Qualitex</i>
requires an individualized, fact-based inquiry into the nature of the
trademark, and cannot be read to sanction an industry-based <i>per se</i> rule.
The District Court created just such a rule, on the theory that �there is
something unique about the fashion world that militates against extending
trademark protection to a single color.� <i>Louboutin,</i> 778 F.Supp.2d at
451.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if <i>Qualitex</i> could be read to permit an
industry-specific <i>per se</i> rule of functionality (a reading we think
doubtful), such a rule would be neither necessary nor appropriate here. We
readily acknowledge that the fashion industry, like other industries, has
special concerns in the operation of trademark law; it has been argued forcefully
that United States law does not protect fashion design adequately.<a
href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[96]</span></span></span></a> Indeed, the case on appeal
is particularly difficult precisely because, as the District Court well noted,
in the fashion industry, color can serve as a tool in the palette of a designer,
rather than as mere ornamentation. <i>Louboutin,</i> 778 F.Supp.2d at
452&#8211;53.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is arguable that, in the particular
circumstances of this case, the more appropriate vehicle for the protection of
the Red Sole Mark would have been copyright rather than trademark. <i>See
generally Kieselstein&#8211;Cord v. Accessories by Pearl, Inc.,</i> 632 F.2d
989, 993&#8211;94 (2d Cir.1980) (addressing the broad issue of aesthetically
functional copyrights and holding that decorative belt buckles that were used
principally for ornamentation could be copyrighted because the primary
ornamental aspect of the buckles was conceptually separate from their
subsidiary utilitarian function); Laura A. Heymann, <i>The Trademark/Copyright
Divide,</i> 60 SMU L.Rev. 55 (2007). However, because Louboutin has chosen to
rely on the law of trademarks to protect his intellectual property, we
necessarily limit our review to that body of law and do not further address the
broad and complex issue of fashion design protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nevertheless, the functionality defense does not
guarantee a competitor �the greatest range for [his] creative outlet,� <i>id.</i>
at 452&#8211;53, but only the ability to fairly compete within a given market.<a
href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[97]</span></span></span></a> <i>See Wallace Int'l
Silversmiths, Inc.,</i> 916 F.2d at 81 (�It is a first principle of trademark
law that an owner may not use the mark as a means of <i>excluding</i>
competitors from a ... market.� (emphasis added)). The purpose of the
functionality defense �is to prevent advances in functional design from being <i>monopolized</i>
by the owner of [the mark] ... in order to encourage competition and the
broadest dissemination of useful design features.� <i>Fabrication Enters.,
Inc.,</i> 64 F.3d at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In short, �[b]y focusing upon hindrances to
legitimate competition, the [aesthetic] functionality test, carefully applied,
can accommodate consumers' somewhat conflicting interests in being assured
enough product differentiation to avoid confusion as to source and in being
afforded the benefits of competition among producers.� <i>Stormy Clime,</i> 809
F.2d at 978&#8211;79.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>Having written at length on the issue of aesthetic
functionality, the court ultimately declined to rule whether Louboutin�s mark

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because we conclude that the secondary meaning of
the mark held by Louboutin extends only to the use of a lacquered red outsole

be applied to any shoe bearing the same color �upper� as the outsole. We
therefore instruct the Director of the Patent and Trade Office to limit the

neither a use of, nor confusingly similar to, the Red Sole Mark. We therefore
affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction insofar as Louboutin could not
have shown a likelihood of success on the merits in the absence of an

<h5><a name="_Toc392009959"><a name="_Toc365461077">iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Ninth Circuit and Aesthetic Functionality Doctrine</a></a></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The effect on competition test for aesthetic functionality
adopted in <i>Wallace Silversmiths</i> and <i>TrafFix Devices</i> has helped to
discipline the doctrine of aesthetic functionality, yet the doctrine can still
cause a great deal of mischief.&nbsp; This is particularly true in cases where
courts (specifically, Ninth Circuit district courts) don�t understand the
purpose of the doctrine and, as to more recent decisions, are insensitive to <i>TrafFix</i>�s
emphasis on whether exclusive rights would put competitors at a �significant <i>non-reputation-related</i>
disadvantage.�&nbsp; <i>TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.</i>,
532 U.S. 23, 32 (2001) (emphasis supplied).&nbsp; Consider a few examples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Vuitton Et Fils S.A. v. J. Young Enterprises, Inc</i>.,
644 F.2d 769 (9th Cir. 1981), the defendant produced knockoff Louis Vuitton
merchandise.&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 772.&nbsp; The defendant claimed that Louis
Vuitton�s well-known repeated floral monogram patterns were aesthetically
functional.&nbsp; Remarkably, the district court agreed: �The repeated pattern
fabric design used on plaintiff's goods constitutes the primary decoration of
those goods and is a factor in their consumer appeal and saleability and as
such is a functional element of the goods. <i>Pagliero v. Wallace China Co.,
Ltd</i>., <i>supra</i>.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 773 (quoting the district
court).&nbsp; The Ninth circuit reversed:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Young argues that if a design is �related to the reasons
consumers purchase that product,� it is functional. However, a trademark is
always functional in the sense that it helps to sell goods by identifying their
manufacturer. The policy expressed in <i>Pagliero</i> and the cases decided
under it is aimed at avoiding the use of a trademark to monopolize a design
feature which, in itself and apart from its identification of source, improves
the usefulness or appeal of the object it adorns. <i>See Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd</i>., 604 F.2d 200, 203 (2d Cir.
1979); <i>Truck Equipment Serv. Co. v. Fruehauf Corp</i>., 536 F.2d 1210, 1218
(8th Cir. 1976); <i>Restatement of Torts</i> � 742, comment (a) (1938).
Functional features of a product are features �which constitute the actual
benefit that the consumer wishes to purchase, as distinguished from an
assurance that a particular entity made, sponsored, or endorsed a product.� <i>International
Order of Job's Daughters v. Lindeburg &amp; Co</i>., 633 F.2d 912, 917 (9th
Cir. 1980). Furthermore, a trademark which identifies the source of goods and
incidentally serves another function may still be entitled to protection. <i>Dallas
Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc</i>., <i>supra</i>, 604 F.2d at 203; <i>Ross-Whitney
Corp. v. Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories</i>, 207 F.2d 190, 196-97 (9th
Cir. 1953).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 774-75</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc</i>.,
457 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2006), the declaratory plaintiff Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc.
(�Auto Gold�) produced license plates, license plate frames, and key chains
bearing the well-known trademarks of the declaratory defendant Volkswagen of
American, Inc. (�Volkswagen�).&nbsp; Auto Gold sought a declaration that this
conduct did not constitute trademark infringement.&nbsp; Specifically, it
argued that, �as used on its key chains and license plate covers, the logos and
marks of Volkswagen and Audi are aesthetic functional elements of the
product&#8212;that is, they are �the actual benefit that the consumer wishes to
purchase�&#8212;and are thus unprotected by the trademark laws.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.
at 1064.&nbsp; The district court agreed:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In ruling for Auto Gold, the district court found that
�[t]he VW and Audi logos are used not because they signify that the license
plate or key ring was manufactured or sold (i.e., as a designation of origin)
by Volkswagen or Audi, but because there is a[n] aesthetic quality to the marks
that purchasers are interested in having.� Concluding that the marks were
�protected under the aesthetic functionality doctrine,� the district court
granted Auto Gold's motion for partial summary judgment, denied the motion for
summary judgment filed by Volkswagen and Audi, and entered an order declaring
that Auto Gold's �license plates, license plate frames and key chains
displaying Volkswagen and Audi trademarks ... are not trademark infringements
and/or trademark counterfeiting.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1066.<a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[99]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On appeal, the Ninth Circuit properly recognized that �[a]ccepting
Auto Gold's position would be the death knell for trademark protection. It
would mean that simply because a consumer likes a trademark, or finds it
aesthetically pleasing, a competitor could adopt and use the mark on its own
products. Thus, a competitor could adopt the distinctive Mercedes circle and
tri-point star or the well-known golden arches of McDonald's, all under the
rubric of aesthetic functionality.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 1064.&nbsp; In
reversing, the Ninth Circuit explained: �[T]here is no evidence that consumers
buy Auto Gold's products solely because of their �intrinsic� aesthetic appeal.
Instead, the alleged aesthetic function is indistinguishable from and tied to
the mark's source-identifying nature.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 1073-74.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This should have settled matters, but amazingly, yet another
district court in the Ninth Circuit has recently embraced the aesthetic
functionality doctrine in a way that would indeed constitute the �death knell�
for trademark protection.&nbsp; In 2011, the Ninth Circuit found that the image
of the cartoon character Betty Boop on various merchandise was aesthetically
functional.&nbsp; <i>See Fleischer Studios, Inc. v. A.V.E.L.A., Inc</i>., 636
F.3d 1115 (9th Cir), withdrawn and superseded by 654 F.3d 958 (9th Cir. 2011).&nbsp;
The opinion�s aesthetic functionality analysis was very severely criticized, so
much so that the Ninth Circuit withdrew the opinion and issued a new one that
never mentioned aesthetic functionality.&nbsp; <i>See Fleischer Studios, Inc.
v. A.V.E.L.A., Inc</i>., 654 F.3d 958 (9th Cir. 2011).&nbsp; On remand back to
the district court, however, the district court decided that it preferred the
reasoning in the withdrawn opinion and found that the <i>defendant�s</i> use of
the Betty Boop character was aesthetically functional: �[A]s a matter of law,
Defendants' use of the Betty Boop mark is an aesthetically functional use, and
not a source-identifying trademark use; such uses are not infringing.�&nbsp; <i>Fleischer
Studios, Inc. v. A.V.E.L.A., Inc</i>., 2012 WL 7179374, *7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 14,
2012).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is striking that Ninth Circuit courts have repeatedly
sought to adapt aesthetic functionality doctrine in order to deny protection to
marks that serve purposes other than source-denotation.&nbsp; What concerns
might be motivating Ninth Circuit courts to do so?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392009960"><a name="_Toc365461078">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deceptive
and Deceptively Misdescriptive Marks</a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In determining whether marks are �deceptive� or �deceptively
misdescriptive� with respect to the goods to which they are affixed, U.S.
trademark law analyzes geographic marks (i.e., marks that convey a geographic
meaning) differently from how it analyzes non-geographic marks.&nbsp; Before
turning to the peculiar manner in which the law treats geographically deceptive
or �primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive� marks, Lanham Act
�2(e)(3), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(e)(3), we first consider the law�s more
straightforward analysis of the deceptiveness or deceptive misdescriptiveness
of non-geographic marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009961"><a name="_Toc365461079">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Non-Geographic</i>
Deceptive and Deceptively Misdescriptive Marks</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A non-geographic deceptive trademark cannot be registered or
otherwise protected under federal trademark law.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act �
2(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(a).&nbsp; By contrast, a non-geographic �deceptively
misdescriptive� mark may be registered or otherwise protected under federal
trademark law, but only if the mark is shown to have developed secondary
meaning as a designation of source.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act&nbsp; ��
2(e)(1) &amp; 2(f), 15 U.S.C. �� 1052(e)(1) &amp; 2(f).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The basic test for determining whether a non-geographic mark
is deceptive or deceptively misdescriptive is relatively straightforward.&nbsp;
In <i>In re Budge Mfg. Co</i>., 857 F.2d 773 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the Federal
Circuit affirmed the TTAB�s refusal to register the mark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>lovee lamb</span> for automobile seat covers
that were not in fact made of lambskin on the ground that the mark was
deceptive.&nbsp; In doing so, it established a three-step test for determining
whether a mark is deceptive or deceptively misdescriptive.&nbsp; The TMEP
summarizes the three steps as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) Is the term misdescriptive of the character, quality,
function, composition or use of the goods?</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) If so, are prospective purchasers likely to believe
that the misdescription actually describes the goods?</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) If so, is the misdescription likely to affect a
significant portion of the relevant consumers� decision to purchase?</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>TMEP � 1203.02(b).&nbsp; If the answer to all three
questions is yes, then the mark is deceptive under Section 2(a) and cannot be
protected.&nbsp; If the answer to question (2) is yes (consumers would likely
believe that the misdescription actually describes the goods), but the answer
to question (3) is no (the misdescription would nevertheless not affect their
decision to purchase), then the mark is deceptively misdescriptive under
Section 2(e)(1) and can be protected upon a showing of secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, for non-geographic marks, the question of whether the
mark�s misdescription would be material to consumers� decisions to purchase the
good is what separates an unprotectable deceptive mark from a potentially
protectable deceptively misdescriptive mark.&nbsp; This can be a difficult
question to answer.&nbsp; The TMEP instructs trademark examining attorneys to
focus on �objective criteria� such as whether the misdescription conveys
superior quality, enhanced performance or function, difference in price, health
benefits, or conformity with meritorious religious practice or social
policy.&nbsp; See TMEP � 1203.02(d)(i).&nbsp; The Federal Circuit has recently
emphasized that the misdescription must be material to a �significant portion
of relevant consumers.�&nbsp; <i>See In re Spirits Intern., N.V</i>., 563 F.3d
1347, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2009).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With respect to geographic marks (i.e., marks whose �primary

while the Lanham Act will protect non-geographic deceptively misdescriptive
marks if they have secondary meaning, <i>see</i> �� 2(e)(1) &amp; 2(f), 15

under any circumstances.&nbsp; <i>See</i> � 2(e)(3); 15 U.S.C. ��
1052(e)(3).&nbsp; For this reason, in <i>In re California Innovations Inc</i>.,
329 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the Federal Circuit established a new test for
geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks that is different
from&#8212;and more demanding than&#8212;the test for non-geographic
deceptively misdescriptive marks.&nbsp; Recall that materiality need not be
shown for a non-geographic mark to be found deceptively misdescriptive.&nbsp;
In contrast, for geographic marks, materiality must be shown for such marks to
be found deceptively misdescriptive.&nbsp; <i>See</i> TMEP � 1210.01(b).&nbsp;
The strange result is that the same findings that would lead to the
determination that a mark is geographically deceptively misdescriptive would
also lead to the determination that a mark is geographically deceptive.&nbsp;
In either case, the Lanham Act will not protect the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following excerpt from <i>In re California Innovations,

geographic marks.&nbsp; Regrettably, this is a relatively minor area of

<p class=NormalNoIndent>RADER, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Lanham Act addresses geographical marks in
three categories. The first category, � 1052(a), identifies geographically
deceptive marks:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be
distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the
principal register on account of its nature unless it&#8212;(a) Consists of or
comprises immoral, <i>deceptive,</i> or scandalous matter; or matter which may
disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead,
institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or
disrepute.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1052(a) (2000) (emphasis added). Although
not expressly addressing geographical marks, � 1052(a) has traditionally been
used to reject geographic marks that materially deceive the public. A mark
found to be deceptive under � 1052(a) cannot receive protection under the
Lanham Act. To deny a geographic mark protection under � 1052(a), the PTO must
establish that (1) the mark misrepresents or misdescribes the goods, (2) the
public would likely believe the misrepresentation, and (3) the
misrepresentation would materially affect the public's decision to purchase the
goods. <i>See In re Budge Mfg. Co.,</i> 857 F.2d 773, 775 (Fed.Cir.1988). This
test's central point of analysis is materiality because that finding shows that
the misdescription deceived the consumer. <i>See In re House of Windsor,</i>
221 USPQ 53, 56&#8211;57, 1983 WL 51833 (TTAB 1983).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The other two categories of geographic marks are
(1) �primarily geographically descriptive� marks and (2) �primarily
geographically deceptively misdescriptive� marks under � 1052(e). The North
American Free Trade Agreement, <i>see</i> North American Free Trade Agreement,
Dec. 17, 1992, art. 1712, 32 I.L.M. 605, 698 [hereinafter NAFTA], as
implemented by the NAFTA Implementation Act in 1993, <i>see</i> NAFTA
Implementation Act, Pub. L. No. 103&#8211;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993), has
recently changed these two categories. Before the NAFTA changes, � 1052(e) and
(f) stated:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be
distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the
principal register on account of its nature unless it&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(e) Consists of a mark which ...</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:.3in'>(2) when used on
or in connection with the goods of the applicant is primarily geographically
descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them�.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(f) Except as expressly excluded
in paragraphs (a) (d) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall prevent
the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive
of the applicant's goods in commerce.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1052(e)(2) and (f) (1988). The law treated
these two categories of geographic marks identically. Specifically, the PTO
generally placed a �primarily geographically descriptive� or �deceptively
misdescriptive� mark on the supplemental register.<a href="#_ftn101"
name="_ftnref101" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[101]</span></span></span></a> Upon a showing of acquired
distinctiveness, these marks could qualify for the principal register.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, in contrast to the permanent loss of
registration rights imposed on deceptive marks under � 1052(a), pre-NAFTA �
1052(e)(2) only required a temporary denial of registration on the principal
register. Upon a showing of distinctiveness, these marks could acquire a place
on the principal register. <i>In re Dial&#8211;A&#8211;Mattress Operating
Corp.,</i> 240 F.3d 1341, 1347, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1812 (Fed.Cir.2001). As
permitted by pre-NAFTA � 1052(f), a mark could acquire distinctiveness or
�secondary meaning� by showing that �in the minds of the public, the primary
significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the
product rather than the product itself.� <i>Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs.,</i>
456 U.S. 844, 851 n. 11 (1982).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the pre-NAFTA era, the focus on distinctiveness
overshadowed the deceptiveness aspect of � 1052(e)(2) and made it quite easy
for the PTO to deny registration on the principal register to geographically
deceptively misdescriptive marks under � 1052(e)(2). On the other hand, the
deception requirement of � 1052(a) protected against fraud and could not be
overlooked. Therefore, the PTO had significantly more difficulty denying
registration based on that higher standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted, the Lanham Act itself does not expressly
require different tests for geographically misleading marks. In order to
implement the Lanham Act prior to the NAFTA amendments, the PTO used a low
standard to reject marks for geographically deceptive misdescriptiveness under
pre-NAFTA � 1052(e), which was relatively simple to meet. In contrast, the PTO
required a much more demanding finding to reject for geographical deception
under � 1052(a). This distinction was justified because rejection under
subsection (a) was final, while rejection under pre-NAFTA subsection (e)(2) was
only temporary, until the applicant could show that the mark had become
distinctive. The more drastic consequence establishes the propriety of the
elevated materiality test in the context of a permanent ban on registration
under � 1052(a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> NAFTA and its implementing legislation obliterated
the distinction between geographically deceptive marks and primarily
geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks. Article 1712 of NAFTA
provides:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>1. Each party [United States, Mexico, Canada] shall
provide, in respect of geographical indications, the legal means for interested
persons to prevent:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation
of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a
territory, region or locality other than the true place of origin, in a manner
that misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good....</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>See</i> NAFTA, Dec. 17, 1992, art. 1712, 32 I.L.M.
605, 698. This treaty shifts the emphasis for geographically descriptive marks
to prevention of any public deception. Accordingly, the NAFTA Act amended �
1052(e) to read:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be
distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the
principal register on account of its nature unless it&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(e) Consists of a mark which (1)
when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is merely
descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, (2) when used on or in
connection with the goods of the applicant is primarily geographically
descriptive of them, except as indications of regional origin may be
registrable under section 4 [15 USCS � 1054], (3) when used on or in connection
with the goods of the applicant is primarily geographically deceptively
misdescriptive of them, (4) is primarily merely a surname, or (5) comprises any
matter that, as a whole, is functional.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(f) Except as expressly excluded
in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(3), and (e)(5) of this section, nothing
herein shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has
become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1052(e)-(f) (2000).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Recognizing the new emphasis on prevention of
public deception, the NAFTA amendments split the categories of geographically
descriptive and geographically deceptively misdescriptive into two subsections
(subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) respectively). Under the amended Lanham Act,
subsection (e)(3)&#8212;geographically deceptive misdescription&#8212;could no
longer acquire distinctiveness under subsection (f). Accordingly, marks
determined to be primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive are
permanently denied registration, as are deceptive marks under � 1052(a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, � 1052 no longer treats geographically
deceptively misdescriptive marks differently from geographically deceptive
marks. Like geographically deceptive marks, the analysis for primarily
geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks under � 1052(e)(3) focuses on
deception of, or fraud on, the consumer. The classifications under the new �
1052 clarify that these two deceptive categories both receive permanent
rejection. Accordingly, the test for rejecting a deceptively misdescriptive
mark is no longer simple lack of distinctiveness, but the higher showing of
deceptiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The amended Lanham Act gives geographically
deceptively misdescriptive marks the same treatment as geographically deceptive
marks under � 1052(a). Because both of these categories are subject to
permanent denial of registration, the PTO may not simply rely on lack of
distinctiveness to deny registration, but must make the more difficult showing
of public deception. In other words, by placing geographically deceptively
misdescriptive marks under subsection (e)(3) in the same fatal circumstances as
deceptive marks under subsection (a), the NAFTA Act also elevated the standards
for identifying those deceptive marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, due to the NAFTA changes in the Lanham Act,
the PTO must deny registration under � 1052(e)(3) if (1) the primary
significance of the mark is a generally known geographic location, (2) the
consuming public is likely to believe the place identified by the mark
indicates the origin of the goods bearing the mark, when in fact the goods do
not come from that place, and (3) the misrepresentation was a material factor
in the consumer's decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Geographically
deceptive or geographically deceptively misdescriptive?</i>&nbsp; Note,
strangely, that �the test for determining whether a mark is primarily
geographically deceptively misdescriptive under �2(e)(3) is now the same as the
test for determining whether a mark is deceptive under �2(a).�&nbsp; TMEP �
1210.05(d).&nbsp; The result is that if the all three elements of the
three-step test set forth in <i>In re California Innovations</i> are met, then
the mark may be geographically deceptive, geographically deceptively
misdescriptive, or both geographically deceptive and geographically deceptively
misdescriptive. &nbsp;Recall that in any of these cases the mark is
unprotectable.&nbsp; For marks not claiming use in commerce or acquired
distinctiveness prior to December 8, 1993 (the date of enactment of the NAFTA
Implementation Act), the PTO will typically issue a refusal based on Section
2(e)(3) and Section 2(a).<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal>The tests for geographic descriptiveness, geographic
deceptiveness, and geographic deceptive misdescriptiveness may appear quite
complicated.&nbsp; Experience has shown that these tests distract the student
from far more important issues in trademark law.&nbsp; To aid in understanding

recent examples of marks held to be geographically deceptively
misdescriptive.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>, <i>In re Miracle Tuesday LLC</i>, 695
F3d 1339, 104 USPQ2d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (affirming the TTAB�s refusal to

connection between the goods and Paris.�); <i>In re Premiere Distillery, LLC</i>,

of consumers who encounter REAL RUSSIAN on applicant's vodka are likely to
incorrectly believe that the vodka comes from Russia and that such mistaken
belief would materially influence their decision to purchase the vodka�); In re
Compania de Licores Internacionales S.A., 102 USPQ2d 1841 (TTAB 2012) (finding <span

style='font-variant:small-caps'>guantanamera</span>, a Spanish word literally meaning
�girl from Guantanamo� or �of or from Guantanamo, Cuba,� primarily
geographically deceptively misdescriptive for cigars not made in Cuba).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Example of a mark
held not to be geographically deceptively misdescriptive</i>.&nbsp; For an
example of a mark held not to be geographically deceptively misdescriptive,
consider <i>In re Glaze Inc</i>., Serial No. 76565437 (TTAB Mar. 17, 2005) (not
citable).&nbsp; In <i>In re Glaze</i>, the TTAB reversed the examining
attorney�s refusal to register the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>swisscell</span>
for batteries not made in Switzerland.&nbsp; The Board found that because the
mark incorporated the word �Swiss,� the primary significance of the mark was a
generally known geographic location.&nbsp; However, the Board found that
consumers would not likely believe that the batteries originated in
Switzerland:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>Even when we view the evidence
that perhaps two Swiss companies make different type of batteries and that
Switzerland is a country with a prosperous and stable market economy, we hold
that, as in <i>California Innovations</i>, 66 USPQ2d at 1859, this is tenuous
evidence that purchasers would expect batteries for lighting to come from
Switzerland�.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>[H]ere the evidence of a
goods/place association consists of a single battery company (Renata) and
another company that makes vehicle batteries. Under the stricter <i>California
Innovations</i> standards, we are constrained to find that the examining
attorney has not established the required goods/place association between
Switzerland and batteries for lighting.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at *4.&nbsp; Finally, the Board found no
evidence that the misrepresentation of the source of the batteries would
influence consumers� decision to purchase them:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>The few references in the
retailers' advertisements to �Swiss quality� and �Swiss manufacture� in
relation to [another Swiss company�s Swiss-made] batteries do not show that
prospective purchasers' decisions would be materially influenced by the term
�Swiss� when purchasing batteries for lighting�</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>The only other evidence that could
indicate that the term �Swiss� may materially impact purchasing decisions is
the nebulous references to �Swiss quality.� There is simply insufficient
evidence to hold that the term �Swiss� applied to virtually any product
materially influences purchasers.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at *4-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>What about
non-material misdescriptiveness for geographic marks?</i>&nbsp; <span
style='line-height:120%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Consider the strange
implications of the Federal Circuit�s holding in <i>In re California
Innovations, Inc</i>., 329 F.3d 1334, (Fed. Cir. 2003).&nbsp; Before the
NAFTA/TRIPS amendments in 1993, geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks
could be registered upon a showing of secondary meaning. Certain U.S. trade
partners, particularly European countries, objected to this apparently lax
standard for the registration of geographically deceptively misdescriptive
terms. In response, the U.S. changed its law to provide that any terms that
qualify as geographically deceptively misdescriptive may not be registered.
However, by adding a materiality requirement, <i>California Innovations</i>
then made it much more difficult for terms to qualify as geographically
deceptively misdescriptive. As a result, at least for certain marks, the U.S.
has arguably adopted an even laxer standard for registration of geographically
misdescriptive terms. If the misdescriptiveness of such terms is not material
to the consumer�s decision to purchase, then the term may be registrable, and
now <i>without any need to show secondary meaning</i>. For if such terms are
not geographically deceptively misdescriptive (because the materiality
requirement is not satisfied), neither are they geographically descriptive, a
status which would trigger the secondary meaning requirement. Instead, in the
wake of <i>California Innovations</i>, it would appear that such terms are
essentially suggestive or arbitrary, i.e., inherently distinctive. For a
thorough discussion of this turn of events, <i>see</i> Robert Brauneis &amp;

<p class=MsoNormal>Federal trademark law will not allow the registration of or
otherwise protect marks that are deemed �scandalous� or �disparaging.�&nbsp; <i>See</i>
Lanham Act � 2(a), 15 U.S.C. �1052(a) (prohibiting the registration of any mark
that �[c]onsists of or comprises immoral�or scandalous matter; or matter which
may disparage�persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national

<p class=MsoNormal>To be barred from protection as scandalous, a mark must be
perceived as scandalous by a substantial composite of the general consuming
public.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., In re Shearer, Serial No. 78690531 (TTAB May

<p class=MsoNormal>By contrast, to be barred from protection as disparaging,
the mark must be perceived as disparaging by a substantial composite of the <i>group
allegedly disparaged</i>.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Lebanese Arak Corp</i>.,
94 U.S.P.Q.2d 1215 (TTAB 2010) (affirming refusal of registration of <span

1994) (affirming refusal to register composite mark for clothing consisting of <span

<p class=MsoNormal>In reading the following two opinions, which analyze a
scandalous and a disparaging mark respectively, consider these questions:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>Why should the PTO and federal

 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>If a mark is disparaging of a
     particular group, shouldn�t that be enough to make it scandalous in the

 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>What proportion of the general

that �[n]o trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished

register on account of its nature unless it[ ] (a) [c]onsists of or comprises
immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter.� 15 U.S.C. � 1052.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The prohibition on �immoral ... or scandalous�
trademarks was first codified in the 1905 revision of the trademark laws, <i>see</i>
Act of Feb. 20, 1905, Pub. L. No. 58&#8211;84, � 5(a), 33 Stat. 724, 725. This
court and its predecessor have long assumed that the prohibition �is not an
attempt to legislate morality, but, rather, a judgment by the Congress that
[scandalous] marks not occupy the time, services, and use of funds of the
federal government.� <i>In re Mavety Media Grp. Ltd.,</i> 33 F.3d 1367, 1374
(Fed.Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted). Because a refusal to register a mark
has no bearing on the applicant's ability to use the mark, we have held that �

id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As might be expected, what constitutes �immoral ...
or scandalous matter� has evolved over time. <i>See id.</i> at 1372. The formal
legal framework, however, has remained consistent: in order to refuse a mark,
�the [Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) ] must demonstrate that the mark is
�shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety; disgraceful; offensive;
disreputable; ... giving offense to the conscience or moral feelings; ... [or]
calling out [for] condemnation.� � <i>Id.</i> at 1371&nbsp; (quoting <i>In re
Riverbank Canning Co.,</i> 25 CCPA 1028, 95 F.2d 327, 328 (1938)). More
concisely, and especially usefully in the context of this case, the PTO may
prove scandalousness by establishing that a mark is �vulgar.� <i>In re
Boulevard Entm't, Inc.,</i> 334 F.3d 1336, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2003). This
demonstration must be made �in the context of contemporary attitudes,� �in the

dictionary evidence of a possible vulgar meaning may be insufficient to
establish the vulgarity of the mark. <i>See id.</i> at 1373&#8211;74. But where
it is clear from dictionary evidence �that the mark[ ] as used by [the

element, consisting of the words COCK SUCKER, and a design element, consisting
of a drawing of a crowing rooster. Since 1979, Fox has used this mark to sell
rooster-shaped chocolate lollipops, which she �displays ... in retail outlets
in small replicas of egg farm collecting baskets to emphasize the country
farmyard motif.� Appellant's Br. 6. The consumers targeted by Fox's business

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In September 2001, Fox applied to register her mark
for use in connection with �[c]hocolate suckers molded in the shape of a
rooster.� On her application form, she indicated the literal portion of the
mark as �CockSucker.� In December 2001, the PTO examiner determined that the
mark �consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter,� and is therefore
unregistrable under � 1052(a). Specifically, the examiner found that a dictionary
defined �cocksucker� as �someone who performs an act of fellatio.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In June 2002, Fox filed a response, noting that
that �Webster's Dictionary defines ... a cock as a rooster, and ... a sucker as
a lollipop,� and asserting that these nonvulgar definitions, which match both
the product design and the design element of the mark, are �more relevant� than
the vulgar definition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;In July 2008�the PTO issued a final refusal.
The examiner conceded that Fox had presented �evidence potentially supporting
an equally relevant non-scandalous meaning,� but concluded that �due to the
strong meaning of �cock-sucker� in society in general,� a �substantial composite
of the general public will ... assign the scandalous meaning to the
wording/mark.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox filed a motion for reconsideration, in which
she clarified that �the intended term to be trademarked was COCK SUCKER [ (with

the two words were clearly separated. J.A. 65. Fox protested that by �driv[ing
the words] together,� the examiner had �stripp[ed] the mark of any possibility
of double entendre from which the relevant humor of the mark is derived,� and
also reiterated that the rooster design was intended to �guid[e] the potential

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span

�COCK is defined ... as �<i>penis,</i>� and SUCKER as, �<i>one that sucks,</i>�
� and that both words are considered vulgar �as used in context.� Conceding
that this vulgar meaning is not the primary meaning of �cock,� the examiner
asserted that �taking COCK in context with SUCKER, the primary meaning of this
wording as a whole is �one who sucks a penis,� � and that �the strong and
commonly known meaning of COCKSUCKER in the general public� ensures that the
two component words, when used together, will �unequivocal[ly]� assume their
vulgar meanings. The examiner continued the refusal, however, to allow Fox to
respond to several questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In her May 2010 response, Fox argued that her
proposed definitions of the disputed terms (�rooster� and �lollipop,�
respectively) would be �<i>more relevant</i> � than those put forward by the
examiner. Fox also argued at length that in light of contemporary attitudes,
the mark was not vulgar.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> In a final office action in May 2011, the examiner

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fox first argues that the Board lacked substantial
evidence to support its finding that her mark has a vulgar meaning. Properly
interpreted, Fox argues, the literal element of her mark means <i>only</i>
�rooster lollipop.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This argument is without merit. As an initial
matter, Fox concedes that �cocksucker� is a vulgar term in its common usage,
and the dictionary evidence is devoid of an alternate, non-vulgar definition
for that word.<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[103]</span></span></span></a>
Fox urges, however, that �[i]n the present case, the space between the words
makes all the difference.� Reply Br. 10. However, Fox concedes that a mark's
�sound� is central to its �commercial impression� for purposes of � 1052. <i>See</i>
Appellant's Br. 32 (citing <i>Palm Bay Imps. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison
Fondee En 1772,</i> 396 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2005)). Fox, moreover, has
admitted that her mark at least in part has a vulgar meaning. She acknowledged
that �the ... humor of the mark is derived� from �[the] possibility of [a]
double entendre,� consisting of a vulgar and a non-vulgar meaning. <i>See</i>
J.A. 181; <i>see also</i> Appellant's Br. 25 n.1. At oral argument, she
conceded that her mark, if used to sell sweaters, would be unregistrable as
vulgar. We think that the Board did not err in concluding that the distinction
between COCKSUCKER and COCK SUCKER is a distinction without a difference. So
too the association of COCK SUCKER with a poultry-themed product does not
diminish the vulgar meaning&#8212;it merely establishes an additional,
non-vulgar meaning and a double entendre. This is not a case in which the
vulgar meaning of the mark's literal element is so obscure or so faintly evoked
that a context that amplifies the non-vulgar meaning will efface the vulgar
meaning altogether. Rather, the mark is precisely what Fox intended it to be: a
double entendre, meaning both �rooster lollipop� and �one who performs
fellatio.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Next, Fox argues that even if the mark is found to
have a vulgar meaning, our precedent affords the mark special solicitude as a
double entendre.<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[104]</span></span></span></a>
In particular, Fox argues that when a mark is a double entendre, with one
vulgar and one non-vulgar meaning, the PTO must demonstrate that the public
would �choose� the non-vulgar meaning. We believe that Fox misreads our
precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As an initial matter, there is no requirement in
the statute that a mark's vulgar meaning must be the only relevant
meaning&#8212;or even the most relevant meaning. Rather, as long as a
�substantial composite of the general public� perceives the mark, in context,
to have <i>a</i> vulgar meaning, the mark as a whole �consists of <i>or
comprises</i> ... scandalous matter.� <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1052(a) (emphasis
added); <i>Boulevard,</i> 334 F.3d at 1340. The word �comprises,� at the time
of the statute's enactment in 1905, meant �includes.� <i>See Webster's Academic
Dictionary</i> 121 (Springfield, Mass., G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1895). Congress
thus chose to extend the prohibition not only to marks that �[c]onsist[ ] of
... scandalous matter,� but also to marks that <i>include</i> scandalous
matter. Fox concedes that the mark's effect as a humorous double entendre
requires the consumer to �understand[ ]� the risqu� as well as the banal
meaning of the mark. Appellant's Br. 25 n.1. We therefore see no reason why the
PTO is required to prove anything more than the existence of a vulgar meaning
to a substantial composite of the general public in order to justify its
refusal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nor do we agree with Fox that the precedent
excludes double entendres from the statutory bar. Fox attempts to derive this
rule from two of our cases: <i>Mavety,</i> 33 F.3d 1367, and <i>Boulevard,</i>
334 F.3d 1336.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Mavety,</i> the court considered the mark
BLACK TAIL as applied to �an adult entertainment magazine featuring photographs
of both naked and scantily-clad African&#8211;American women.� <i>Mavety,</i>
33 F.3d at 1368&#8211;69. The Board affirmed the examiner's refusal to register
the mark, citing a vulgar dictionary definition of �tail� as �a female sexual
partner.� <i>Id.</i> at 1369&#8211;70. The applicant appealed, citing the
ambiguity created by the presence of two alternative, non-vulgar meanings: �a
woman's rear end,� and �a type of evening coat ... worn by men at formal
occasions.� <i>Id.</i> The court reversed, holding that �[i]n view of the
existence of ... an alternate, non-vulgar definition� (a woman's rear end), the
Board erred by refusing registration based solely on the existence of a vulgar
dictionary definition, without identifying any �[extrinsic] evidence as to
which of these definitions the substantial composite would choose.� <i>Id.</i>
at 1373&#8211;74. Nowhere in its opinion did the court describe the
constellation of meanings at issue as a �double entendre�; to the contrary, it
described the different meanings as �alternate[s].� <i>Id. Mavety</i> is thus a
case about ambiguous marks, and does not control a case, such as this one, in
which the conceded effect of the mark is to invoke a �double meaning.� <i>See</i>
3 J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i> �
19:77 (4th ed. 2012) (describing <i>Mavety</i> as turning on the presence of
�reasonable ambiguity� regarding the mark's interpretation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Boulevard,</i> this court dealt with a
situation in which the only pertinent definition of the term at issue<a
href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[105]</span></span></span></a> was vulgar. <i>Boulevard,</i>
334 F.3d at 1339&#8211;40. The court upheld the Board's decision affirming the
PTO's refusal, even though the PTO had relied exclusively on dictionary
evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 1340&#8211;41. The court also distinguished other
examples of marks approved for registration as involving �double entendres.� <i>Id.</i>
at 1341, 1343. <i>Boulevard</i> does not suggest, however, that a mark that
includes a double entendre is exempt from the prohibition of � 1052(a) when the
mark would be seen by a substantial composite of the general public as having
both a vulgar and a non-vulgar meaning. <i>Id.</i> at 1341.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nor could treating double entendres differently be
justified in light of the statutory objectives. A double entendre is a term
that has a �double meaning,� or a �double connotation.� <i>See supra</i> note
2. That is, in order to be a double entendre, the term must rely on the public
to perceive and understand both meanings. Fox concedes as much, stating that
�the essence of a double entendre� requires the consumer to �understand[ ] and
draw[ ] a distinction between the [two] meanings.� Appellant's Br. 25 n.1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nonetheless, Fox urges us to apply to vulgar double
entendres the presumption of registrability applied by the PTO to double
entendres one of whose meanings is merely descriptive under � 1052(e)(1). <i>See</i>
TMEP � 1213.05(c) (8th ed. 2011). Apart from the fact that we are not bound by
the PTO's regulations, however, we find this analogy unpersuasive. Section
1052(a)'s ban on vulgar marks is demonstrably different from � 1052(e)(1)'s
prohibition on descriptive marks. Section 1052(e)(1), unlike � 1052(a), omits
the words �or comprises,� and further specifies that a mark must be �<i>merely</i>
descriptive.� � 1052(e)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, � 1052(e)(1) is inapplicable
if any one of the meanings is not merely descriptive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We recognize that there are �whimsical� and
humorous aspects to Fox's mark. <i>See</i> Appellant's Br. 43. But the fact
that something is funny does not mean that it cannot be �scandalous.� Indeed,
the Supreme Court in <i>Pacifica,</i> in determining that the use of the word
�cocksucker� is generally patently �indecent� under 18 U.S.C. � 1464, made a
point of noting that �[t]he transcript of [humorist George Carlin's] recording
... indicates frequent laughter from the audience.� <i>FCC v. Pacifica Found.,</i>
438 U.S. 726, 729 (1978).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nothing in this decision precludes Fox from
continuing to sell her merchandise under the mark at issue, or from seeking
trademark protection for some other, otherwise registrable element of her
product's design, dress, or labeling. If Fox is correct that the mark at issue
�bring[s] [nothing] more than perhaps a smile to the face of the prospective
purchaser,� Appellant's Br. 43 (second alteration in original), then the market
will no doubt reward her ingenuity. But this does not make her mark
registrable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To reiterate, the outcome of our decision is that
Fox will remain free to use her mark in commerce. She will be unable, however,
to call upon the resources of the federal government in order to enforce that
mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span

application to register the mark HEEB (in standard character form) for
�clothing, namely, jackets, jerseys, sweat pants, sweat shirts, track suits,
t-shirts, tank tops and pants; headwear� and �entertainment, namely, conducting
parties��. &nbsp;The application includes a claim of ownership of Registration
No. 2858011 issued on June 29, 2004 for the mark HEEB (in standard character
form) for �publication of magazines��.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span

2(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. �1052(a), on the ground that applicant's
mark �is disparaging to a substantial composite of the referenced group,
namely, Jewish people.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When the refusal was made final, applicant appealed
and the appeal has been fully briefed. We affirm the refusal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The examining attorney contends that the word HEEB
is a highly disparaging reference to Jewish people, that it retains this
meaning when used in connection with applicant's goods and services, and that a
substantial composite of the referenced group finds it to be disparaging. In
support of this contention the examining attorney has submitted several
dictionary definitions that define HEEB as a derogatory word, including the
following definition from <u>The Cassell Dictionary of Slang</u> (1998):
�Hebe/Heeb -- a derog. term for a Jew.�<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106"

We also take judicial notice of the following definition from <u>The New Oxford
American Dictionary</u> (2d ed. 2005): �Hebe n. <i>informal, offensive</i> a
Jewish person. &gt; early 20<sup>th</sup> cent.: abbreviation of Hebrew.�<sup> </sup>&nbsp;In
addition, the examining attorney submitted printouts of excerpts retrieved from
the Nexis database which report that individuals representing Jewish groups or
in their individual capacity consider the term HEEB to be a disparaging term,
including as used in connection with applicant's magazine. Some examples
highlighted by the examining attorney are reproduced below:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>Adopting a �title for a
     publication that is offensive to many Jews is unnecessary and in my view
     counterproductive,� said Ken Jacobson, ADL's [Anti-Defamation League]
     associate national director. �One could argue this is a sign that Jews
     have really made it, that people can poke fun and really satirize.� However,
     �we're also living in a world where anti-Semitism is flourishing,� he
     said. �The usual sensitivity should continue and not assume that things
     are so secure.� �Jewish Telegraphic Agency,� December 18, 2003;�</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>What about the show's use of

     traditionally on par with �nigger.� �New York Post,� December 18, 2005 (in
     reference to the television program �So Jewtastic�).</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span

the examining attorney �ignored the context and manner in which applicant's

disparaging to the Jewish community.� Br. p. 5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applicant also argues that the examining attorney's
evidence is insufficient to meet the USPTO's burden to set forth a prima facie
case. In particular, applicant contends that the determination of disparagement
cannot be based �on isolated editorial comments made by members of one
organization or one vocal individual whose opinions do not represent Jewish
popular thought or the cultural mainstream.� Br. pp. 6-7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span

established Jewish philanthropies and cultural organizations have openly and
actively supported Applicant's magazine and events through their continued
funding and sponsorship.�October 13, 2006, Response p. 2. In support of this
statement, applicant made of record evidence that includes letters from various
individuals representing prominent Jewish organizations, such as the UJA
Federation and Hillel, or that were submitted in their individual capacity.<a

are set forth below:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'>Heeb is widely distributed
     among the Jewish student population with whom we work so closely, and
     currently we have yet to receive any complaints about the name or its

     not received any complaints among the student population but we have yet
     to receive a single complaint from a parent or a community member. While
     there may be some in the Jewish and non-Jewish community who take offense
     to the magazine's articles, it has been our uniform impression that the
     Jewish audiences Hillel interacts with understand the playful, satirical
     nature and format of the magazine, and do not consider the name to be
     offensive�The magazine's target population of Jewish students and young
     Jewish adults certainly were not around to experience the negative
     associations with the word �hebe� as some of the older Jewish generations
     may have. Letter from Wayne L. Firestone, President, Hillel, The Foundation

</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In further support of its position, applicant also
submitted examples of advertisements in its magazine which show, according to
applicant, the acceptance of the term by a wide range of Jewish organizations
(e.g., American Jewish World Service, Birthright Israel, Jewish Fund for
Justice, Museum of Jewish Heritage, New Israel Fund, University of Judaism) and
various commercial enterprises (e.g., American Apparel, Sony BMG Music, SoyVay,
Stella Artois, Streits).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

�institutional support� from Steven Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation,
the Nathan Cummings Foundation, the Walter and Elise Haas Foundation, the
United Jewish Appeal, Hillel, The National Foundation for Jewish Culture and
the Charles &amp; Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation. The record also shows
that applicant's magazine currently has approximately 100,000 subscribers.
Finally, applicant points to a later revision of a dictionary entry submitted
by the examining attorney that applicant contends supports non-disparaging uses
of the term. The 1998 edition of <i>The Cassell Dictionary of Slang</i> defines
Heeb as �a derog. term for a Jew� (see supra), whereas the 2005 second edition
includes the following additional entry, �[1920's+] Jewish.�</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> Registration of a mark which consists of matter
which may disparage, inter alia, persons is prohibited under Section 2(a) of
the Trademark Act. To determine whether a proposed mark is disparaging the
Board applies the following two-part test (�<i>Harjo</i> test�):</p>

<p class=Blockquote>1) what is the likely meaning of the matter in question,
taking into account not only dictionary definitions, but also the relationship
of the matter to the other elements in the mark, the nature of the goods or
services, and the manner in which the mark is used in the marketplace in
connection with the goods or services; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote>2) if that meaning is found to refer to identifiable
persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols, whether that meaning may be
disparaging to a substantial composite of the referenced group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The burden of proving that a mark is disparaging
rests with the USPTO. <i>Squaw Valley</i>, 80 USPQ2d at 1271.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Whether a proposed mark is disparaging must be
determined from the standpoint of a substantial composite of the referenced
group (although not necessarily a majority) in the context of contemporary
attitudes. <i>Squaw Valley</i>, 80 USPQ2d at 1269 and <i>Harjo</i>, 50 USPQ2d
at 1758. <i>See also Boulevard</i>, 67 USPQ2d at 1477 and <i>In re McGinley</i>,
660 F.2d 481, 211 USPQ 668, 673 (CCPA 1981). It has been held that, at least as
to offensive matter, dictionary evidence alone can be sufficient to satisfy the
USPTO's burden, where the mark has only one pertinent meaning. <i>Boulevard</i>,
67 USPQ2d at 1478.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, as noted above, while applicant's use of
the mark for a magazine may assist in understanding how the term will be
perceived by the relevant group, we make our determination based on the goods
and services as identified in the application, which do not include either
magazines or the service of publishing magazines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under the <i>Harjo</i> test we must first
determine, based on the evidence of record, the �likely meaning� of HEEB,
taking into account the nature of the goods and services and the manner in
which it is used in the marketplace. The second prong addresses whether that
meaning is disparaging to a substantial composite of the relevant group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As to the first prong, we look at the �likely
meaning� in the context of the goods and services as identified. Here, there is
no dispute that HEEB means a Jewish person and that HEEB has no other meaning
pertinent to clothing or entertainment services. There are no �other elements�
in the mark to affect its meaning, and there is nothing about the way the mark
is used in the marketplace from which one would understand the term as meaning
anything other than a Jewish person, even if a person connected the clothing or
entertainment services with applicant's magazine which is published by,
targeted towards, and about Jewish people. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Harjo</i>, 50
USPQ2d at 1742, rev'd on other grounds, 68 USPQ2d 1225 (�This is not a case
where, through usage, the word �redskin(s)� has lost its meaning, in the field
of professional football, as a reference to Native Americans in favor of an
entirely independent meaning as the name of a professional football team.
Rather, when considered in relation to the other matter comprising at least two
of the subject marks and as used in connection with respondent's services,
�Redskins' clearly both refers to respondent's professional football team and
carries the allusion to Native Americans inherent in the original definition of
that word.�)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Turning to the next prong, we must determine
whether or not the term would be perceived as disparaging. Applicant argues
that �the context in which Applicant uses the term �heeb� is the exact opposite
of derogatory and is rather as a symbol of pride and progressive identity among
today's Jews.� Br. p. 5. Applicant argues, in particular, that the
entertainment services are �nearly always tailored to Jewish themes and are
always held in support of Jewish community building�[and] are attended almost
exclusively by members of the Jewish community, making the broad acceptance of
the term �heeb� unmistakable in this context.� Br. p. 6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, as noted above, the identification of the
goods and services in this application, i.e., clothing and entertainment
services, is not limited to use by a Jewish group for those in the Jewish
community who are not offended by this use.<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[108]</span></span></span></a>
In other words, the use is presumed to be public use viewable by any member of
the referenced group, including those members of the group who may be offended
by the term. Our consideration of whether the term is disparaging is not restricted
to the perception of applicant's magazine subscribers who have no objection to
HEEB as the title of applicant's magazine. Rather, we are charged with taking
into account the views of the entire referenced group who may encounter
applicant's clothing and advertising for its entertainment services in any
ordinary course of trade for the identified goods and services. Thus, all
members of the American Jewish public may encounter the HEEB mark in
advertising in newspapers, billboards, or magazines (other than applicant's
magazine), on a website or, with respect to the clothing items, in stores
selling the clothing (the identification has no limitations as to channels of
trade), and, in the context of the clothing where HEEB would be emblazoned on
the apparel (such as t-shirts and sweatshirts), all public places where that
clothing is worn. <i>Boston Red Sox Baseball Club Limited Partnership v. Brad
Francis Sherman</i>, ___ USPQ2d ___ (Slip Op. 91172268, September 9, 2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The dictionary definitions unanimously underscore
the derogatory nature of HEEB.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applicant argues that the Jewish community does not
object to, or does not view, applicant's use of HEEB as a trademark to be
disparaging. Applicant cites to its evidence of letters from �prominent members
of the Jewish community endorsing applicant.� However, this evidence is
countered by the examining attorney's substantial evidence of others in the
Jewish community who have objected to use of the term in the context of
applicant's magazine. Even Jennifer Bleyer, one of the founders of applicant's
magazine, has acknowledged that the term is perceived as disparaging by some
members of the Jewish community: �There are actually some people, who are
fairly prominent in the Jewish community, who have written me some nasty
emails, who definitely said that they're offended by the name.� �New York
Observer,� July 30, 2001.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, applicant's own evidence shows that not
all members of the relevant public find the term HEEB to be unobjectionable. On
the contrary, the letters submitted by applicant recognize that some members of
the relevant public find the term derogatory, and suggest that there is a
generational divide in the perception of this term. For example, Professor
Sarna writes that he �can recall hearing this taunt as a youngster in public
school, and even today, the term is occasionally used in this way by prejudiced
people.� �</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;What is clear from the record is that within
the referenced group there are disparate views, perhaps most prominently
delineated along generational lines, as to whether HEEB retains its disparaging
character in the context of applicant's use in connection with its magazine. We
find it reasonable to conclude that such disparate views likewise exist in
connection with use of the mark for applicant's clothing and entertainment
services. Thus, the question raised by this record is how do we balance
competing views within the referenced group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fact that applicant has good intentions with its
use of the term does not obviate the fact that a substantial composite of the
referenced group find the term objectionable. Applicant's evidence, in support
of its contention that its use of the term HEEB is not disparaging, does not
erase the perception of the others, as represented by the examining attorney's
evidence. From this we conclude that applicant's intentions do not change the
analysis. This record clearly establishes that applicant's intent does not
remove the �anti-Semitic animus� when applicant uses the word HEEB. Our focus
must be on the perception of the referenced group and not applicant's
intentions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to applicant's argument that a minority
opinion should not veto registration of a particular mark, this is not in
keeping with the standard set forth by our primary reviewing court. While case
law does not provide a fixed number or percentage, it is well established that
a �substantial composite� is not necessarily a majority. <i>In re McGinley</i>,
211 USPQ at 673. Here we have clear evidence that a substantial composite of
the referenced group considers HEEB to be a disparaging term. The examining
attorney has presented evidence from various segments of the Jewish community, including
the Anti-Defamation League, a university professor, rabbis, a talk-show host
and ordinary citizens. Although perhaps among many of the college-age
population to whom applicant's magazine is directed the word HEEB may not have
the same derogatory connotation, the evidence is clear that, at a minimum,
among the older generation of Jews the term retains its negative meaning. The
post-college age Jewish population must be considered a substantial composite
for purposes of our analysis. As noted above, applicant's identified goods and
services must be deemed to be encountered by all members of the referenced
group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Overall, we find that the evidence of record
supports a conclusion that the term is considered to be disparaging by a
substantial composite of the referenced group, regardless of context, including
in connection with applicant's identified goods and services. <i>Squaw Valley</i>,
at 1277.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While applicant may intend to transform this word,
the best that can be said is that it is still in transition. Although some in
the community may not find it disparaging, as noted above, the evidence shows
that there is a substantial component of those in the named group who do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to applicant's argument based on the
First Amendment's proscription against restrictions on expression, this
decision only pertains to applicant's right to register the term and �it is
clear that the PTO's refusal to register [applicant's] mark does not affect
[its] right to use it. No conduct is proscribed, and no tangible form of
expression is suppressed. Consequently, [applicant's] First Amendment rights
would not be abridged by the refusal to register [its] mark.� <i>In re McGinley</i>,
211 USPQ at 672, citing H<i>oliday Inn v. Holiday Inn, Inc</i>., 534 F.2d 312 (CCPA
1976). <i>See also Mavety</i>, 31 USPQ2d at 1928.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applicant's argument that other potentially
disparaging terms have been registered cannot assist it in registering a
derogatory term. It is well established that even if some prior registrations
have some characteristics similar to the applicant's, the USPTO's allowance of
such prior registrations does not bind the Board. <i>In re Nett Designs Inc</i>.,
236 F.3d 1339, 57 USPQ2d 1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 2001).�The fact that, whether
because of administrative error or otherwise, some marks have been registered
even though they may be in violation of the governing statutory standard does
not mean that the agency must forgo applying that standard in all other cases.�
<i>In re Boulevard</i>, at 1480.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, while applicant argues that doubt should
be resolved in its favor, based on this record, we have no doubt that HEEB is
disparaging to Jewish people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Decision</span>: The refusal to register under Section
2(a) is affirmed.</p>

this cancellation proceeding pursuant to Section 14 of the Trademark Act of

the term REDSKINS for professional football-related services on the ground that
the registrations were obtained contrary to Section 2(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(a),
which prohibits registration of marks that may disparage persons or bring them
into contempt or disrepute. In its answer, defendant, Pro-Football, Inc.,

<p class=Normal-Centered><u>Prior Litigation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This is the second time the Board has faced a
petition to cancel these registrations. On September 10, 1992, Suzan Harjo and
six other Native Americans filed a petition to cancel the above-noted registrations
on the ground the marks consist of or comprise matter which disparages Native
American persons, and brings them into contempt, ridicule, and disrepute; and
the marks consist of or comprise scandalous matter under Section 2(a) of the
Trademark Act. Respondent denied the salient allegations in the petition for
cancellation and asserted eleven affirmative defenses, including laches. The
Board struck all of respondent�s affirmative defenses. <i>Harjo v. Pro
Football, Inc.</i>, 30 USPQ2d 1828, 1833 (TTAB 1994); and 50 USPQ2d 1705, 1710
(TTAB 1999). After seven years of litigation, involving multiple discovery and
pretrial motions, the Board issued its decision on the merits, held that
respondent�s REDSKINS marks were disparaging to Native Americans when registered
and ordered the registrations canceled. <i>Harjo v. Pro-Football, Inc.</i>, 50
USPQ2d at 1743.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Respondent appealed the decision to the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia. On motion for summary
judgment, the District Court reversed the Board for two reasons:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The TTAB�s finding of disparagement is not supported by
substantial evidence and must be reversed. The decision should also be reversed
because the doctrine of laches precludes consideration of the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><a name="co_pp_sp_999_3_1"></a><i>Pro-Football, Inc. v.
Harjo</i>, 284 F. Supp. 2d 96, 68 USPQ2d 1225, 1263 (D.D.C. 2003).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The petitioners appealed the rulings that the claim
of disparagement was not supported by substantial evidence and that the defense
of laches may be asserted against a disparagement claim. The United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the District
Court applied the wrong standard in evaluating laches as to at least one of the
petitioners because �laches runs only from the time a party has reached his
majority� and, while retaining jurisdiction over the case, remanded the record
to the District Court to evaluate whether laches barred petitioner Mateo
Romero�s claim. <i>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo</i>, 415 F.3d 44, 75 USPQ2d
1525, 1528 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The D.C. Circuit did not address the issue of
whether substantial evidence supported the Board�s finding of disparagement. On
remand, the District Court found that laches did bar the claim:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[D]efendant Romero unreasonably delayed his bringing of a
cancellation proceeding and ... his eight-year delay demonstrates a lack of
diligence on his part. The court further finds that Defendant Romero�s delay
has resulted in both trial prejudice and economic prejudice to Pro-Football,
such that it would be inequitable to allow Defendant Romero to proceed with his
cancellation petition.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo</i>, 567 F. Supp.2d 46,
87 USPQ2d 1891, 1903 (D.D.C. 2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Petitioners appealed. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the
decision of the lower court on the issue of laches and stated that the
petitioners �argue only that the District Court improperly assessed evidence of
prejudice in applying laches to the facts at issue� and limited its decision
�to that question.� <i>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo</i>, 565 F.3d 880, 90 USPQ2d
1593 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Thus, the D.C. Circuit resolved the case solely on the
issue of laches, never addressing the Board�s finding of disparagement on the
merits.</p>

<p class=Normal-Centered><u>The Current Litigation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span

2010.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F9_ID0E6CAE_1"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In March 2011, the parties stipulated, with certain
exceptions, that the entire <i>Harjo</i> record may be submitted into evidence
through a Notice of Reliance<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F10_ID0EZDAE_1"></a><a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F11_ID0EYEAE_1"></a>�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As stipulated, the parties only reserved the right
to make objections based on relevance to evidence earlier admitted into the <i>Harjo</i>
record and admitted into this case under [the Notice of Reliance]. All other
possible objections, including those based on hearsay, were waived. This was
confirmed from both parties at the oral hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In view of the intense pretrial litigation engaged
in by the parties in <i>Harjo</i> and because the record created in that case
was voluminous, the Board ordered the parties to appear at a pretrial
conference....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After briefing by the parties, the Board issued
another order setting forth the applicable law relating to the issues of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In regard to the former issue, the Board noted that
the test for disparagement comprises a two-step inquiry:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>a. What is the meaning of the matter in question, as
it appears in the marks and as those marks are used in connection with the
goods and services identified in the registrations?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>b. Is the meaning of the marks one that may disparage
Native Americans?</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo</i>, 68 USPQ2d at 1248; <i>Harjo

__ F.3d __, 110 USPQ2d 1867, 1869 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Both questions are to be
answered as of the various dates of registration of the involved marks. <i>Pro-Football,
Inc. v. Harjo</i>, 68 USPQ2d at 1248; <i>Harjo v. Pro-Football, Inc.</i>, 50
USPQ2d at 1735, 1741. In deciding the second question, whether the term
�redskins� may disparage Native Americans, we look not to the American public
as a whole, but to the views of the referenced group (<i>i.e.</i>, Native
Americans). <i>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo</i>, 68 USPQ2d at 1247; <i>Harjo v.

at 1247 (quoting <i>Harjo v. Pro-Football, Inc.</i>, 50 USPQ2d at 1739). A
�substantial composite� of the referenced group is not necessarily a majority
of the referenced group. <i>In re Heeb Media LLC</i>, 89 USPQ2d 1071, 1074

(�Whether a mark comprises immoral and scandalous matter is to be ascertained
in the context of contemporary attitudes, and the relevant viewpoint is not
necessarily that of a majority of the general public, but of a �substantial

USPQ2d 1923, 1925-26 (Fed. Cir. 1994)). What comprises a �substantial
composite� of the referenced group is a fact to be determined at trial. In
making this determination, �we are charged with taking into account the views
of the entire referenced group who may encounter [respondent�s services] in any
ordinary course of trade for the identified goods and services.� <i>Heeb Media</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;As confirmed by the District Court:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Meaning of the Matter In Question ... �This is not a case
where, through usage, the word �redskin(s)� has lost its meaning, in the field
of professional football, as a reference to Native Americans in favor of an
entirely independent meaning as the name of a professional football team.
Rather, when considered in relation to the other matter comprising at least two
of the subject marks and as used in connection with respondent�s services,
�Redskins� clearly both refers to respondent�s professional football team and
carries the allusion to Native Americans inherent in the original definition of
that word.� Id. Based on the record before the TTAB, the Court finds that this
conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. <i>Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo</i>,
68 USPQ2d at 1248-1249 <i>quoting Harjo v. Pro-Football, Inc.</i>, 50 USPQ2d at

style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> The
term REDSKINS in the registered marks when used in connection with professional

test, �what is the meaning of the matter� is established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The only issue left for decision is the second
question in the disparagement test (was the meaning of the marks, at the times

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Having narrowed the issue to be determined, it is
now necessary to understand what type of disparagement case the facts of this
limited case present. We must make our determination in the context of a
respondent�s goods or services. Such context can:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) turn an innocuous term into a disparaging one, <i>see
In re Lebanese Arak Corp.</i>, 94 USPQ2d 1215, 1223 (TTAB 2010) (likely meaning
of KHORAN is the Islamic holy text and use for wine disparages religion and
beliefs of Muslim Americans); <i>see also Doughboy Industries, Inc. v. The
Reese Chemical Co.</i>, 88 USPQ 227 (Exm�r in Chief 1951) (Doughboy refers to
World War I American soldier as reinforced by picture of soldier on packaging
and use on �a prophylactic preparation for the prevention of venereal diseases�
disparages the soldiers); or&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) strip the disparaging meaning from an otherwise
disparaging term, <i>see Squaw Valley</i>, 80 USPQ2d 1264, 1267 (SQUAW when
used with ski-related goods means only the geographic location Squaw Valley ski
resort and does not retain the meaning Native American woman under the first
part of the test, and, as such is not disparaging; but as to non-ski-related
goods and services the meaning remains Native American woman, i.e., the goods
and services did not change the meaning, and the evidence was sufficient to
support the second prong of the test that the term is considered disparaging as
the term is used in connection with the identified goods or services); or&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) have no effect on a term�s disparaging meaning, <i>see
Heeb Media</i>, 89 USPQ2d 1071, 1077 (applicant�s good intent and inoffensive
goods and services do not obviate finding that HEEB is disparaging in context
of the goods and services; and disagreement within the referenced group does
not erase the perception of those who find it disparaging).<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F43_ID0ELUAG_1"></a><a href="#_ftn123"
name="_ftnref123" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, petitioners assert that REDSKINS is a racial
slur, thus the facts do not present the <i>Doughboy</i> case because it is not
allegedly an innocent term where the nature of the goods or services renders
the mark disparaging. The facts also do not fall within the part of the <i>Squaw
Valley</i> case where the Board reversed the refusal as to the ski-related gear
because it did not pass the first prong of the test inasmuch as the word lost
its allusion to Native American women when used in the ski context due to the
geographic location called �Squaw Valley� and the well-known ski resort located
there. Here, it is conceded by the parties and established by the record that
the term REDSKINS retains its meaning �Native American� even when used with
respondent�s services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_999_10_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Turning
back, then, to the issue in this case, namely, whether the term REDSKINS was
disparaging at the time of registration, the services do not have an effect on
the meaning of the term, i.e., the first prong. The question is only as to the
second prong, whether the term is disparaging. The facts of this case
demonstrate the type of disparagement presented in <i>Heeb</i> and the
non-ski-related goods and services portion of <i>Squaw Valley</i>. In other
words, respondent�s alleged honorable intent and manner of use of the term do
not contribute to the determination of whether a substantial composite of the
referenced group found REDSKINS to be a disparaging term in the context of
respondent�s services during the time period 1967-1990, because the services
have not removed the Native American meaning from the term and intent does not
affect the second prong. If it is found to be disparaging during the relevant
time period, then the Trademark Act mandates removal from the register.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In presenting their case, petitioners laid out two
categories of evidence to prove that the term REDSKINS, even when considered
solely as used with football and cheerleading services, was disparaging during
the relevant time periods: (1) a general analysis of the word; and (2) the
specific views of the referenced group. In some instances these two types of
evidence intersect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted above, the prior <i>Harjo</i> case
encompassed more issues as reflected by the pleadings and illustrated by the
voluminous and wide-ranging record. We only focus on the evidence that most
directly reflects the sentiments of Native Americans. In particular, concerning
the general analysis of the word, we focus on the testimony and reports
provided by the parties� respective experts, dictionary definitions and
reference books. For the specific views of Native Americans, we focus on the
National Congress of American Indians� (�NCAI�) 1993 Resolution 93-11, the
deposition of NCAI Executive Director, Ms. JoAnn Chase, the deposition of Harold
Martin Gross, and various newspaper articles, reports, official records and

Native Americans</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Barnhart explains that �[t]he original (or
core) meaning of the word redskin identifies the race of people found by
colonizing Europeans in the 16th and 17th Centuries.�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F51_ID0EM3AG_1"></a> In his report Mr. Barnhart
confirms that ��redskin(s)� as an ethnic term refers to skin color:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>It is reasonable to expect people upon encountering
something new to use a term which bears on its use, size, appearance or other
characteristic feature. The word red appears in a large number of terms in
English. It should be noted that there is another meaning for redskin
descriptive of a variety of potato. In the case of the potato it is because of
its color. In the case of the people living in North America upon the arrival
of Europeans it was likewise based upon appearance. . . . In recent years the sensitivities
of these people have caused some speakers of English to adjust their usage of
some of these terms accordingly. . . . The naturalness of the construction of
the word redskin is underscored by the presence in the language of other terms
with reference to color in describing the appearance of a person�s skin. Blue
skin is a 19th Century term used to describe blacks. See for instance Grose
1796 edition where he defines blue skin as �a person begotten of a black woman
by a white man. One of the blue squadron; any one having a cross of the black
breed, or, as it is termed, a lick of the tar brush.� . . . Another example of
this genre is darkskin for a black. Still other examples include yellow-skin
for an Asian, black-skinned and brown-skinned for blacks.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In extrapolating on the concept of the use of skin
color in language Mr. Barnhart testifies as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. Do you know the word darky?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q Is that word natural in its construction insofar as
it applies to complexion?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. Is it offensive to African-Americans?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. It can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Q. Is it derogatory?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A. Depending on the context, yes. But I haven�t
evaluated the context of darky particularly, so I would want to see some more
examples and evaluate what evidence I could accumulate, yes.<a

or in their expert reports, the seminal work in lexicography, <i>Dictionaries:
The Art and Craft of Lexicography</i>, written by Sydney I. Landau and first
published in 1984.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F65_ID0EDKBG_1"></a> Mr.
Barnhart, the lexicographer, explained that usage labels are a �[r]eflection of
the opinion of the editor in chief ... But some people that are in lexicography
have been known to be less stalwart and have caved into suggestions from
non-editorial sources.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F66_ID0EWKBG_1"></a> He
explains that �unlabeled terms are standard and labeled terms are labeled for
some particular character.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F67_ID0EGLBG_1"></a>
Mr. Barnhart explained that the �basic and longstanding practice in
lexicography which deals with noteworthy ranges of usage of any given entry
term is to label those instances of terms when the usage deviates from
�Standard English.��<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F68_ID0EWLBG_1"></a>
According to Mr. Barnhart, a term is generally �assumed to be �Standard� if it
is unlabeled.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F69_ID0EGMBG_1"></a> However,
there are times when a word �is worthy of special attention, a label (usually
in italic type) is included in the entry.�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F70_ID0EVMBG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;<a name="co_pp_sp_999_13_1"></a>Mr. Barnhart
explains that there is no standardized method in the field of lexicography
regarding restrictive usage labeling.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>There are no agreed upon criteria for finding some usages
vulgarly offensive or contemptuous or abusive. There are few studies that shed
any light on the degree of offensiveness of specified terms under specified
conditions.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F71_ID0ETNBG_1"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each expert points to the influence of outside forces, or
�pressure groups� on the adoption of usage labels by dictionary editors. For
example, Dr. Butters testifies that sociologists, historians, and
anthropologists applied ��sociopolitical pressure� regarding the use of the
term �redskin� on dictionary editors and �that any dictionary that labels
redskin as a derogatory term is doing so, at least indirectly, as a result of,
at least in large part, sociopolitical pressure.�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F72_ID0EVOBG_1"></a> This phenomenon is also
recognized in the reference works relied on by the experts.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F73_ID0E2OBG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As part of his research, Mr. Barnhart reviewed
dictionary entries for the term �redskin� between 1859 and 1992. He found no
restrictive usage labels for the term �redskin� in any dictionaries prior to
1965.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F74_ID0ESPBG_1"></a> Beginning in 1966
Mr. Barnhart�s reviewed dictionary entries start to include usage labels
indicating the term is offensive. <i>See Random House Unabridged</i> (1st ed.
1966). From that time on, more publishers include such labels at an increasing
rate. By 1983, all of Mr. Barnhart�s examples include a usage label indicating
it is offensive.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F75_ID0EDQBG_1"></a> Mr.
Barnhart�s conclusion only references labels that use the word disparaging:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Since 1966, the labeling of the term has been
erratic at worst and inconsistent at best. Of the twenty-eight dictionaries
consulted which appeared between 1966 and 1992, ten editors reported the term
as �standard English�. Only two dictionaries have identified the term redskin
as �disparaging�.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F76_ID0E3QBG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, we consider the usage labels that employ
the term �offensive� also to support the legal conclusion under Section 2(a)
that a term is ��disparaging.� Therefore, Mr. Barnhart�s conclusion is based on
too narrow a construction because he views the label �disparaging� as requiring
intent.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F77_ID0ETRBG_1"></a> As noted above,
for the purposes of our legal review intent does not figure into the equation.
More significantly, we disagree that the labeling is erratic and inconsistent.
Rather it shows a clear trend beginning in 1966 to label this term as offensive
and by 1986 the dictionaries are unanimous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Barnhart also found that among dictionary
editors� labels �there has been a sensitivity to how people react to that term
[redskin] now.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F78_ID0EVSBG_1"></a> In his
expert report, Mr. Barnhart made the following conclusion based on his
evaluation of the term �redskin� as it appears in various dictionary entries
during the relevant time frame:</p>

<p class=Blockquote><a name="co_pp_sp_999_14_1"></a>[T]he use of the term
redskin, in its core meaning and as recorded in dictionaries, is usually
recognized among lexicographers as �Standard English� which means that it is
acceptable in both formal and informal speech or writing of educated people.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F79_ID0EHTBG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This conclusion stands in contrast to the trend in
usage labels during the relevant time period discussed above and the severe
drop-off in usage discussed below. It is also contradicted by his statement in
the same report that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The record of dictionary editors� opinions as reflected in
the labeling of usage for the term <u>redskin</u> suggests that during the
latter third of this century there has developed some change in the perceived
usage of the term.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F80_ID0EMUBG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We further note Mr. Barnhart is addressing usage by
the general population and not from the viewpoint of Native Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In his expert report, Dr. Butters opined that
�sporadic labeling of <i>redskin</i> as �offensive� is of dubious value in
assessing the tone and full meaning of <i>redskin(s)</i> in past and present
American culture.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F81_ID0EVVBG_1"></a> Dr.
Butter�s ultimate conclusion is of limited probative value in that it pertains
to general �American culture� rather than to the Native American viewpoint. In
1996, Dr. Butters testified as to the following:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the last 10 or 15 years, one begins to see in
dictionaries the--in some dictionaries the labeling of the term redskin as
sometimes offensive. One also begins to see in very recent years references to
the use of the term redskin as a possibly offensive term. So that there is
this, what I would say--my conclusion is a very recent incipient change.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F82_ID0EQWBG_1"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>54</span></span><span

during a portion of the relevant time period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span

media prior to the late sixties and very sporadic usage thereafter. A few
examples are set forth below:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Nunberg conducted several searches of an
electronic database featuring articles from major newspapers and magazines
published between approximately 1975 through 1989 to glean information about
use of the word �redskins� in the context of Native Americans.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F89_ID0EX3BG_1"></a> According to Dr. Nunberg,
�newspapers and television use have a particular influence on the way words are
used and [help] shape the general impressions of the meanings of those
[words].�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F90_ID0EI4BG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>57</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Nunberg reported that the database search
results showed 136,473 instances of �redskin,� �redskins,� and other words
beginning with �redskin,� such as �redskinnettes,� with the �vast majority�
involving references to the Washington Redskins.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F91_ID0E44BG_1"></a> Dr. Nunberg then conducted a
focused search, filtering out terms such as �team,� �sport,� �Redskin Park,�
�football,� ��game,� �fan,� and �ticket,� to yield results of those instances
when the word ��redskin� was used to refer to a Native American person.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F92_ID0EE5BG_1"></a> This search resulted in
approximately 300 references, although some of these still referred to the
Washington Redskins, potatoes and peaches.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F93_ID0EK5BG_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>58</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dr. Nunberg reviewed the focused search results by
hand and found �71 distinct stories in which the word was used to refer to
Indians.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F94_ID0EE6BG_1"></a> According to Dr.
Nunberg, none of these 71 occurrences demonstrated use of ��redskin� as a
standard term to refer to a Native American,<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F95_ID0EJ6BG_1"></a> indicating that �the word is
not a �neutral synonym� for Indian[.]�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F96_ID0EX6BG_1"></a> Of those occurrences, many
examples use the term in the context of racial slurs or discrimination, for
example:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>A man who resigned from the Pulaski County sheriff�s
office because of alleged harassment as an American Indian has won $24,727 in a
race discrimination lawsuit. . . . He said he was called �chief,� �Indian Joe�

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_999_16_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>59</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> More
significant than the relatively small number of uses as a reference to Native
Americans, and many of those in the context of racial slurs, is the relative
absence of use of the term to describe a person. Dr. Nunberg found it
significant that this search yielded so few results showing the term �redskin�
as a reference to a Native American:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>There were in this database over 74,000 instances of the
phrase �American Indian� or �American Indians.� And over 73,000 instances to
the phrase � �Native Americans,� a disproportion of about 2,000 to 1 which
suggests that the use of �redskin� to refer to Indian is extremely rare in this
database which suggests some reason for avoiding the term since it is, in fact,
a commonly used term, for example, in the cinema and historical sources.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F99_ID0E4BAI_1"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>60</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Respondent objects to Dr. Nunberg�s opinion as
irrelevant because it is lacking in scientific basis. However, we do not rely
on Dr. Nunberg�s ultimate opinions and conclusions regarding the word
�redskins,� rather we look to the underlying data that is not in dispute which
undeniably shows a drop-off in usage. This is corroborated by respondent�s
expert, Mr. Barnhart who conducted a similar electronic database search,
discussed <i>infra</i>. As to the data, respondent�s objection that the �uses
that date from outside the pertinent time periods [are irrelevant] and are not
reflective of Native Americans� viewpoints,� is overruled.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F100_ID0ENDAI_1"></a> As noted above, the search
encompasses the relevant time period, and is relevant in correlation to
objection to use of this term by Native Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>61</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr.
Barnhart conducted a similar search using a Nexis electronic database group
file featuring major newspapers, magazines and journals published between 1969
and 1996.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F101_ID0EAEAI_1"></a> He found that
the term �redskin� or �redskins� appeared in 143,920 articles at least once.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F102_ID0EMEAI_1"></a> Similar to Dr. Nunberg�s
initial search results, Mr. Barnhart reported that the results of his �redskin�
database search were �overwhelming to be in the context of sports,� with less
than two percent of the results referring to Native Americans.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F103_ID0E2EAI_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>62</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Barnhart would not draw any inferences about
the infrequency in which the term �redskin� or �redskins� was used to refer to
Native Americans. He testified that it was not what he was asked to do and it
would be a significantly greater project to determine whether there is any
significance to the lack of occurrences.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F104_ID0EXFAI_1"></a><sup>104</sup> However, in
his report he did, in fact, draw conclusions, when he concluded that the term
REDSKIN �is acceptable in both formal and informal speech or writing of
educated people.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F105_ID0E5FAI_1"></a> The
conclusion he drew was that its absence from the database references somehow
supports, or at least does not refute, his finding that the term is part of
standard English and acceptable for formal and informal speech or writing. Such
a conclusion stands in contradiction to the stark drop off in usage as shown by
Dr. Nunberg�s research and supported by Mr. Barnhart�s own research which
shows, <i>inter alia</i>, use of the term in many literary sources until 1969
where his search of the Nexis database spanning the years 1969-1996 reveals
only 2 percent of the appearances of �redskin(s)� related to �Amerindians� (96
percent referenced respondent�s team and 2 percent referenced Miami
University�s former team name), and the addition of the usage labels in the
dictionaries during the same time period. Mr. Barnhart confirms that for the
last thirty years (from 1967 to 1997 the date of the deposition) �the
overwhelming context in which the term redskins is used in general literature�
is in a sports context.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F106_ID0ENGAI_1"></a>
To the extent respondent relies on this data to show that because it is printed
in newspapers reporting on the professional football team by that name it is
not disparaging in that context, Mr. Barnhart testified that his report is not
based on Native American response to the term in this context, therefore, we
cannot rely on this data to make such a finding or to even raise doubt about
other findings, regarding the viewpoint of Native Americans.<a
name="co_pp_sp_999_17_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>63</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Barnhart testifies that while the term
�redskin(s)� was not disparaging �as applied to American Indian persons� in
1967-1985 it might have been offensive.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F107_ID0EIHAI_1"></a> As noted above, Mr.
Barnhart attaches intent of the speaker to the word disparaging and his view of
offensive is more in line with the meaning of disparaging in the context of
Section 2(a).</p>

regard to respondent�s relevancy objection, any statement made after each
registration issued is not a statement from the time of registration; thus,
based on respondent�s logic even testimony taken from individuals in 1993-1996

witnesses� opinions during the years 1967-1990, and as such, would be
irrelevant. However, the mere fact that an opinion is voiced in 1993 does not
mean the opinion was not held by that group or individual in the 1967-1990 time
period. In <i>Harjo</i>, we note, the opinions about views from 1967-1990 given
by the individual plaintiffs through testimony were accepted, by both the Board
and the District Court.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F115_ID0EWPAI_1"></a>
Here, we have a claim that the registered marks disparaged Native Americans
when registered. We find that a resolution passed by an organization such as
NCAI, which throughout the relevant time period represented approximately
thirty percent of Native Americans, setting forth the past and ongoing
viewpoint of the Native Americans it represents is clearly probative of the
views of Native Americans held at the referenced time period.<a

<p class=Normal-Centered>CONCLUSIONS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>79</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted above, as was found in the <i>Harjo</i>
case, both by the Board and the District Court, and conceded by respondent,
�the meaning of the matter in question,� retains the core meaning Native
American when used as the name of respondent�s sports team. More specifically,
the term �redskin(s)� as used by respondent in its registered marks when used
in connection with professional football retains the �likely meaning� Native
Americans. Much of respondent�s evidence is directed to the first part of the
test. Respondent�s argument regarding �secondary meaning� in the sense that it
has �a secondary or alternate meaning� denoting a football team, is not
persuasive in that the ��secondary meaning� has not stripped the word
�redskins� of its �ethnic� meaning.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F209_ID0ESWCI_1"></a> <i>See Squaw Valley</i>, at
1282 (emphasis added) (Squaw Valley ski resort meaning of squaw is �likely
meaning� <i>�rather than</i> the meaning of Native American woman or wife�).<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F210_ID0EQXCI_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>80</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We turn then to the second question, �was the
meaning one that may have disparaged� a substantial composite, which need not
be a majority, of Native Americans, at the times of the registrations. The crux
of this case is whether or not this record supports petitioners� contention
that the answer to that question is yes. Respondent contends that it does not
and characterizes the record as, at most, showing a handful of individuals (the
<i>Harjo</i> petitioners, the current petitioners, the letter writers, a few
individuals from various organizations) who have their own individual opinion.
Such a characterization, however, ignores, and is contradicted by the
substantial evidence of record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>81</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> NCAI Resolution 93-11 represents the views of a
substantial composite of Native Americans. NCAI consists of member tribes from
across the United States and they voice their collective opinion through the
Executive Council by resolutions. A resolution from the oldest Native American
organization composed of tribes from across the United States and structured in
a manner to represent the collective opinion of its membership through
resolutions is strong evidence of the views of Native Americans.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F211_ID0ERZCI_1"></a> The NCAI members throughout
the relevant time period represent approximately 30 percent of Native
Americans.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F212_ID0EXZCI_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_999_29_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>82</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> The
trend in dictionary usage labels also corroborates the time frame of objections
from Native Americans starting in the late sixties and continuing through the
nineties as lexicographers begin and finally uniformly label the term as
�offensive� or �disparaging.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F214_ID0EO2CI_1"></a>
The recognition that this racial designation based on skin color is disparaging
to Native Americans is also demonstrated by the near complete drop-off in usage
of �redskins� as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960�s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>83</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The record establishes that, <i>at a minimum</i>,
approximately thirty percent of Native Americans found the term REDSKINS used
in connection with respondent�s services to be disparaging at all times
including 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978 and 1990. Section 2(a) prohibits registration
of matter that disparages a substantial composite, which need not be a
majority, of the referenced group. Thirty percent is without doubt a
substantial composite. To determine otherwise means it is acceptable to subject
to disparagement 1 out of every 3 individuals, or as in this case approximately
626,095 out of 1,878,285 in 1990.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F215_ID0EU3CI_1"></a> There is nothing in the
Trademark Act, which expressly prohibits registration of disparaging terms, or
in its legislative history, to permit that level of disparagement of a group
and, therefore, we find this showing of thirty percent to be more than
substantial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>84</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Respondent has introduced evidence that some in the
Native American community do not find the term �Redskin� disparaging when it is
used in connection with professional football. While this may reveal differing
opinions within the community, it does not negate the opinions of those who
find it disparaging. The ultimate decision is based on whether the evidence
shows that a substantial composite of the Native American population found the
term �Redskins� to be disparaging when the respective registrations issued. <i>Heeb
Media LLC</i>, 89 USPQ2d at 1077. Therefore, once a substantial composite has
been found, the mere existence of differing opinions cannot change the
conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>85</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In view of the above, petitioners have shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that a substantial composite of Native Americans
found the term REDSKINS to be disparaging in connection with respondent�s
services during the relevant time frame of 1967-1990. Accordingly, the six
registrations must be cancelled as required under Sections 2(a) and 14(3) of
the Trademark Act.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F216_ID0ET5CI_1"></a></p>

<p class=Normal-Centered>DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><a name="co_pp_sp_999_35_1"></a>Bergsman, Administrative
Trademark Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> I respectfully dissent from the majority�s decision
to grant the petition on the claim of disparagement because the dictionary
evidence relied upon by the majority is inconclusive and there is no reliable
evidence to corroborate the membership of National Council of American
Indians.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To be clear, this case is <i>not</i> about the
controversy, currently playing out in the media, over whether the term
�redskins,� as the name of Washington�s professional football team, <i>is</i>
disparaging to Native Americans <i>today</i>. The provisions of the statute under
which the Board must decide this case&#8212;�� 2(a) and 14(3) of the Trademark
Act, 15 U.S.C. �� 1052(a) and 1064(3)&#8212;require us to answer a much
narrower, legal question: whether the evidence made of record in this case
establishes that the term �redskins� <i>was</i> disparaging to a substantial
composite of Native Americans <i>at the time each of the challenged
registrations issued</i>.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F228_ID0EKRGK_1"></a>
<i>See generally Consorzio del Proscuitto di Parma v. Parma Sausage Prods.,
Inc.</i>, 23 USPQ2d 1894, 1898-99 (TTAB 1992) (discussing the language of
Lanham Act � 14(3) and explaining that the ��registration was obtained�
language Congress used to specify when a registration for a mark may be
cancelled under the enumerated statutory provisions, such as � 2(a), �shows an
intent that only if it should not have issued in the first place should a
registration more than five years old be cancelled�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The new petitioners here have filed a petition to
cancel the same registrations on one of the same grounds asserted in the <i>Harjo</i>
cancellation proceeding originally filed with the Board. Not only is this claim
the same as one in the <i>Harjo</i> cancellation proceeding, but the evidence
relating to whether the term �redskins� was disparaging to Native Americans
during the relevant time period predominantly is the same as well. As noted by
the majority, in this case the new petitioners re-submitted most of the same
evidence that the <i>Harjo</i> petitioners submitted&#8212;evidence which the
district court previously ruled was insufficient to support an order to cancel
the challenged registrations as disparaging. The evidence from <i>Harjo</i> was
augmented by depositions of the individual petitioners here, each of whom
testified that they found the term �redskins� in the challenged marks
offensive.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F229_ID0EGUGK_1"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, beyond the statutory constraint that the
Board can decide only whether the marks can remain registered, the Board�s
decision also is constrained by the evidence placed before it. The new
petitioners in this proceeding made the decision to simply re-use the trial
record from the previous <i>Harjo</i> litigation, without substantial
augmentation. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals did not overturn the district
court�s ruling in <i>Harjo II</i> that the evidence introduced at the Board in
the <i>Harjo</i> cancellation proceeding was insufficient to support the
Board�s decision in that case. Nor has the passage of time aided what could be
described as a stale record. The consequence of petitioners� decision to rely
on the same evidence previously found insufficient to support cancellation
without substantial augmentation is that the evidence before the Board in this
case remains insufficient as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_999_36_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> By
this dissent, I am not suggesting that the term �redskins� was <i>not</i>
disparaging in 1967, 1974, 1978, and 1990 (the registration dates at issue).
Rather, my conclusion is that the evidence petitioners put forth fails to show
that it was.</p>

<p class=Normal-Centered>THE RECORD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The evidence submitted by petitioners can most
charitably be characterized as a database dump. Despite the fact that the Board
conducted a case management conference and issued an order �to clarify the
applicable law prior to trial to allow the parties to focus their testimony and
evidence on facts relevant to the legal issues,�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F230_ID0EZXGK_1"></a> petitioners submitted the
entire <i>Harjo</i> file and even lodged objections to the evidence that they
submitted. There was no order or structure to petitioners� evidence that told a
compelling story or presented a coherent case. One need look no further than
gyrations the majority employed to establish the membership of the National
Council of American Indians. It is astounding that the petitioners did not
submit any evidence regarding the Native American population during the
relevant time frame, nor did they introduce any evidence or argument as to what
comprises a substantial composite of that population thereby leaving it to the
majority to make petitioners� case have some semblance of meaning.</p>

the fact that the issue before us is how Native Americans perceive the term

whether the term �darky� is derogatory, he said that �[d]epending on the
context, yes.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F232_ID0EM1GK_1"></a> Likewise,
we must determine how Native Americans perceive the term �Redskins� when used
in connection with the name of a football team. In this regard, the record
includes evidence, albeit one example after the relevant time period, regarding
Native Americans using the term �Redskins� to identify the name of their sports
teams. The record includes the following material:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

tribal basketball tournament.<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F234_ID0EF3GK_1"></a>
To the extent that post-1990 evidence has any relevance, it shows Native
Americans using the term �Redskins� in a prideful way to identify their teams.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We can imply from the use of �Redskins� by Native
Americans in connection with the name of sports teams that the context in which
�Redskins� is used changes the perception of the term. Thus, for example, when
a dictionary usage label says �often offensive,� the usage label would not
encompass use of the term �Redskins� in connection with a team name because
that would not be offensive to Native Americans who identify their teams with
the name ��Redskins.� <i>See</i> the discussion about dictionary usage labels <i>infra</i>.</p>

conducted by Mr. Barnhart. He found no restrictive usage labels for the term
�redskin� in any dictionaries prior to 1965. Beginning in 1966 Mr. Barnhart�s
dictionary entries start to include usage labels indicating the term is
offensive. <i>See Random House Unabridged</i> (1st ed. 1966). However, the
record includes a copy of the 1967 <i>Random House Unabridged Dictionary</i>.
There is no copy of the 1966 edition. Thus, at the time Registration No.

often considered offensive.�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F250_ID0E5KHK_1"></a>
Thus, at the time Registration Nos. 0978824, 0986668, 0986668, and 1085092
registered, there were two dictionaries with usage labels stating that the term
�Redskin� is �often offensive,� again meaning that it is not always offensive
and leaving open the possibility that �Redskins� is not considered offensive
when used in connection with the name of a football team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on the above-noted evidence, the majority
found that there is a �clear trend beginning in 1966 to label this term as
offensive.� However, at the relevant times (1967, 1974 and 1978), that �clear
trend� comprised only two dictionaries. Two does not make a trend. In fact the
next dictionary to set forth a negative usage label was the 1980 <i>Oxford
American Dictionary</i>,<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F251_ID0E2MHK_1"></a>
six years after the 1974 <i>Thorndike-Barnhart Intermediate Dictionary</i>. The
evidence does not support the majority�s finding of fact No. 7 that
�[b]eginning in 1966 and continuing to 1990, usage labels in dictionaries
indicating the term REDSKINS to be offensive, disparaging, contemptuous or not
preferred appear and grow in number,� as applied to Registration Nos. 0836122,
0978824, 0986668, 0986668, and 1085092.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F252_ID0EAOHK_1"></a> The dictionary evidence is
not sufficiently probative to justify cancelling respondent�s registrations
when, as noted by the majority, any cancellation of a registration should be
granted only with �due caution� and �after a most careful study of all the
facts.� <i>Rockwood Chocolate Co., Inc. v. Hoffman Candy Co.</i>, 152 USPQ at

<p class=Normal-Centered><u>Use of the term Redskins in Various Media</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority references Dr. Nunberg�s survey of
electronic databases from major newspapers and magazines published between
approximately 1975 through 1989 to glean information about the use of the word
�redskins� in the context of Native Americans.� Because Dr. Nunberg�s survey
begins in 1975, the conclusions he draws are not relevant to Registration No.
0836122 registered in 1967 and Registration Nos. 0978824, 0986668, and 0986668
registered in 1974.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Barnhart conducted a similar search using a
Nexis electronic database group file featuring major newspapers, magazines and
journals published between 1969 and 1996.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F253_ID0ESQHK_1"></a> He found that the term
�redskin� or �redskins� appeared at least once in 143,920 articles.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F254_ID0E5QHK_1"></a> Similar to Dr. Nunberg�s
initial search results, Mr. Barnhart reported that the results of his �redskin�
database search were �overwhelming to be in the context of sports,� with less
than two percent of the results referring to Native Americans.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F255_ID0EFRHK_1"></a> Mr. Barnhart would not draw
any inferences about the infrequency in which the term ��redskin� or �redskins�
was used to refer to Native Americans. He testified that it was not what he was
asked to do and it would be a significantly greater project to determine
whether there is any significance to the lack of occurrences.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F256_ID0EPRHK_1"></a> Nevertheless, he did
conclude that since the term REDSKIN appeared in 143,920 articles, it �is
acceptable in both formal and informal speech or writing of educated people�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F257_ID0EURHK_1"></a> at least as it applies to
sports teams.</p>

style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> In
view of the foregoing, the majority�s conclusion that the �near complete
drop-off in usage of �redskins� as a reference to Native Americans beginning in
the 1960�s�D� is somehow probative that the term is disparaging is not
supported by the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority finds that the resolution passed by
the National Congress of American Indians (�NCAI�) in 1993 is �clearly
probative of the view of Native Americans held at the relevant time period
because the NCAI �represented approximately thirty percent of Native Americans�
and the resolution set forth ��the past and ongoing viewpoint of the Native
Americans it represents.� Despite the assertions in the resolution that the
organization represents �the American Indian and Alaska Tribal governments and
people gathered in Crystal City, Virginia, of the Washington D.C. area, for the
1993 Executive Council Meeting�<a name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F258_ID0EOTHK_1"></a>
of the organization, there is no reliable evidence supporting the number of
Native Americans or tribes that attended the meeting or that were members of
the organization during the relevant time frame between 1967 and 1990.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The evidence supporting the majority�s finding of
fact No. 27 that �[a]pproximately 150 tribes were members [of the NCAI] in
1993� and its conclusion that �[t]he NCAI members throughout the time period
represent approximately 30 percent of Native Americans� is a house of cards
that collapses upon examination.</p>

I find that petitioners failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that
a substantial composite of Native Americans found the term REDSKINS to be
disparaging in connection with respondent�s services during the relevant time
frame of 1967-1990. Accordingly, the six registrations should not be cancelled

examining attorney asserted that �the Estate of Benny Goodman continues to
protect his intellectual property rights.� The Examining Attorney submitted the
following evidence to support the refusal:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>1. <i>Benny Goodman: The Official Website of the King of
Swing</i> (bennygoodman.com) provides the following information:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>CMG Worldwide is the exclusive business representative for
the Estate of Benny Goodman. We work with companies around the world who wish

Goodman is [sic] a protectable property right owned by the Estate of Benny
Goodman. Any use of the above, without the express written consent of the

<p class=Blockquote>2. A search for �Benny Goodman� in the <i>Answers.com</i>

<p class=Blockquote>1. The mark is the same as, or a close approximation of,
the name of or identity previously used by another person;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>2. The mark would be recognized as such because it points

<p class=Blockquote>3. The person named by the mark is not connected with the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As indicated above, applicant is seeking to register
the mark BENNY GOODMAN COLLECTION THE FINEST QUALITY (stylized) and the
Examining Attorney asserts that the mark is a close approximation of the name
�Benny Goodman.� We find that the commercial impression engendered by
applicant's mark is that there is a �Benny Goodman� collection of products
which makes applicant's mark a close approximation of the name Benny Goodman.
Moreover, applicant effectively concedes this point by not arguing that its
mark is not a close approximation of the name �Benny Goodman.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B. <u>Whether applicant's mark points uniquely and
unmistakably to Benny Goodman</u>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The requirement that applicant's mark point
uniquely and unmistakably to Benny Goodman, the bandleader, composer and
clarinetist, does not mean that Benny Goodman must be a unique name. Rather, in
the context of applicant's fragrances and cosmetics, leather goods and
clothing, we must determine whether consumers would view the mark as pointing
only to Benny Goodman, the bandleader, composer, and clarinetist, or whether
they would perceive the name �Benny Goodman� as having a different meaning. <i>See
Hornby v. TJX Companies Inc.</i>, 87 USPQ2d 1411, 1426 (TTAB 2008). In this
regard, we note that it is commonplace for performers and owners of well-known
marks to expand their product lines to incorporate a diverse set of goods to
capitalize on the renown of their names and brands. <i>Cf. In re Phillips-Van
Heusen Corp.</i>, 228 USPQ 949, 951 (TTAB 1986) (�The licensing of commercial
trademarks for use on �collateral� products (such as clothing, glassware,
linens, etc.) which are unrelated in nature to those goods or services on which
the marks are normally used, has become a common practice in recent years.�); <i>General
Mills Fun Group, Inc. v. Tuxedo Monopoly, Inc.</i>, 204 USPQ 396, 400 (TTAB
1979) (�Moreover, it is a matter of common knowledge that famous marks are
frequently used on certain types of items, such as clothing, glassware, trash
cans, pillows, etc., which are unrelated in nature to those goods on which the
marks are normally used; such use has become a part of everyday life which we
cannot ignore.�), <i>aff'd </i>648 F.2d 1335, 209 USPQ 986, 988 (CCPA 1981)
(finding no error in the Board's finding that it is common knowledge that famous
marks are frequently used on diverse and �novelty� items). <i>See also Source
Services Corporation v. Chicagoland JobSource, Inc.</i>, 643 F.Supp. 1523 (N.D.
Ill. 1986) (�As product lines become increasingly diversified, and as �labels'
having sales prestige of their own are affixed to products as diverse as
clothes and cigarettes, the significance of product <i>dissimilarity</i> have
become attenuated.�) (Emphasis in the original). Accordingly, we find that
consumers encountering applicant's mark used in connection with fragrances and
cosmetics, leather goods and clothing will associate the name �Benny Goodman�
with the well-known bandleader, composer and clarinetist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applicant argues that �Benny Goodman is or was well
known only in connection with music among those that are over the age of 30.
Ask anyone aged 40 or under and they do not know the person, the musician. In
fact, the name Benny Goodman is not at all unique as is easily seen when
consulting the facebook [sic] pages. Benny Goodmans galore!� However, applicant
did not make of record any of the asserted Benny Goodman FACEBOOK pages; nor
did applicant introduce any evidence supporting its argument that few people
under the age of 30 or 40 can identify Benny Goodman the musician. Assertions
in briefs are not evidence. <i>In re Simulations Publications, Inc.</i>, 521
F.2d 797, 187 USPQ 147, 148 (CCPA 1975). <i>See also In re Sauer</i>, 27 USPQ2d
1073, 1074 n.1 (TTAB 1993) (�Applicant's assertion that she took an informal
survey as to how the mark is perceived is without evidentiary support.�). If
applicant wished to show that there are numerous individuals known as Benny
Goodman, or that the renown of Benny Goodman, the bandleader, composer and
clarinetist, has faded to the point that the applied for mark does not point
uniquely and unmistakably to him, then applicant was obligated to introduce
such evidence to rebut the evidence submitted by the examining attorney.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>D. <u>Whether Benny Goodman's name or reputation is
sufficiently famous that a connection with Benny Goodman would be presumed when

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The evidence noted above is sufficient to show that
the name Benny Goodman has fame or renown today such that the use of that name
as a trademark by an unauthorized user will falsely suggest a connection with
Benny Goodman, the bandleader, composer and clarinetist. Applicant contends
that �music lovers of today especially those under 30 will not recognize the
name as that of a famous musician.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We recognize that the fame and renown of a
celebrity may recede after the celebrity's death. However, because of his great
celebrity in the entertainment field, Benny Goodman remains a well-known figure
among a sufficient segment of the population as to support finding a false
suggestion of a connection.<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0in'>----------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trademark owner must make a �use in commerce� of its mark,
as that phrase is defined in Lanham Act � 45, in order for the mark to qualify
for registration under � 1 of the Lanham Act or for protection as an
unregistered mark under � 43(a). <i>See</i> � 1(a)(1) (providing that �[t]he
owner of a trademark used in commerce� may apply for registration of that
mark); � 1(d) (providing that the owner of mark filed on an intent-to-use basis
must file a&nbsp; �[v]erified statement that trademark is used in commerce� in
order for the mark to proceed to registration); <i>International Bancorp, LLC
v. Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Estrangers a Monaco</i>, 329 F.3d
359 (4th Cir. 2003) (assuming, without citing a statutory basis, that for an
unregistered mark to qualify for protection under Section 43(a), it must be
�use[d] in commerce�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;We consider here what kinds of uses of a mark will
satisfy � 45�s definition of �use in commerce.�&nbsp; Both of the opinions
below emerge out of priority disputes, i.e., disputes over who by virtue of
their being the first to �use in commerce� a particular mark can claim
exclusive rights in that mark.&nbsp; (We will address priority in more detail
in Part I.E on the geographic scope of trademark rights).&nbsp; But underlying
the priority issue in both cases is the more basic question of how much and
what kind of use will make the mark registrable or otherwise protectable under
the Lanham Act.&nbsp; The first opinion, <i>Aycock Engineering, Inc. v.
Airflite, Inc</i>., 560 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2009), involves the question of
whether Aycock made sufficient use in commerce of its mark to justify
registration of the mark at the PTO.&nbsp; The second opinion, <i>Planetary
Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc</i>., 261 F.3d 1188 (11th Cir. 2001),
involves the question of whether the assignee of the unregistered mark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>coolmail</span> for email services could
benefit from the priority date established by the assignor�s pre-assignment use
of the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To avoid ambiguity, it may be useful to recognize from the
start the several different aspects of the concept of �use in commerce� in U.S.
trademark law, only one of which we will focus on in this subsection.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>�Use in Commerce� as
     Implementing the Commerce Clause Limitation on the Reach of Congressional
     Power</i>: As the Lanham Act � 45 definition of �commerce� quoted above
     indicates, federal trademark law will regulate only those uses that fall
     within the Congress�s Commerce Clause power.&nbsp; Thus, if a trademark
     owner does not use its trademark in a manner that effects interstate
     commerce, federal trademark law will not protect that trademark.&nbsp; The
     trademark owner must instead rely on state law.&nbsp; This is very rarely
     an issue given current Commerce Clause jurisprudence.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>.,
     <i>Larry Harmon Pictures Corp. v. Williams Restaurant Corp</i>., 929 F.2d
     662, 18 U.S.P.Q.2d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>�Use in Commerce� for
     Purposes of Establishing Trademark Rights</i>: This is the focus of this
     subsection.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>�Use in Commerce� for
     Purposes of Determining Whether a Trademark Owner Has Abandoned Its Rights</i>:
     If a trademark owner ceases to use its trademark in commerce without an
     intent to resume use, it may be deemed to have �abandoned� its mark.&nbsp;
     <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 45, 15 U.S.C. � 1127 (defining when a mark shall
     be deemed �abandoned�).&nbsp; We will address the doctrine of trademark
     abandonment in Part III.D below.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>�Use in Commerce� for
     Purposes of Determining Whether a Defendant Has Made an Infringing
     �Actionable Use� of the Plaintiff�s Mark</i>: In several high-profile
     cases in the past decade, defendants have argued that the terms of each of
     the infringement sections of the Lanham Act&#8212;Lanham Act �� 32, 43(a),
     and 43(c)&#8212;require a showing that the defendant is making a �use in
     commerce� to be liable.&nbsp; These defendants have argued that they are
     not making a �use in commerce� as that term is defined under Lanham Act �
     45 and should thus not be found liable.&nbsp; We will address the case law
     on this issue, which has ultimately largely come to reject this argument,
     in Part II.A below.</li>
</ul>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>The student is strongly advised to distinguish between
these various aspects of �use in commerce� as we proceed, particularly the difference
between �use in commerce� by the plaintiff for purposes of establishing the
plaintiff�s trademark rights versus �use in commerce� by the defendant for
purposes of establishing the defendant�s trademark infringement.</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>O'GRADY, District Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> In
1970, Respondent&#8211;Appellant Aycock Engineering, Inc. (�Aycock
Engineering�) applied for a service mark, which was registered at the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (�USPTO�) in 1974 after examination. In
2007, however, the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (�TTAB�) declared the
registration void because it failed to meet the �use in commerce� element of
the Lanham Act. Aycock Engineering now appeals the TTAB's ruling. The question
presented herein is whether the use in commerce requirement is met when an
applicant uses a service mark in the preparatory stages of a service's
development, but never offers the service to the public. We hold that it is
not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>I. BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the late 1940s, William Aycock conceived of and
began work on a service involving chartering flights in the air taxi industry.
At that time, the common practice for air taxi companies was to lease entire
airplanes, not individual seats. Consequently, individual passengers not
belonging to a larger party faced more difficulty and expense in chartering a
flight. Mr. Aycock intended, through his service, to allow solo passengers to
arrange flights on chartered aircraft for less cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Aycock did not plan on operating the chartered
air taxi services himself. Instead, his goal was to develop a system where he
would serve his customers by acting as the middleman, or �communication link,�
between the customer and one of the air taxi service operators he contracted
with to provide flights on an individual seat basis. Mr. Aycock planned to
advertise his service, which he called the AIRFLITE service, to the public and
to have those interested in using the service call a toll-free phone number to
schedule reservations. After learning of customers' travel plans, Mr. Aycock
would then arrange for the air taxi service to fly his customers with similar
travel plans to their destinations. Mr. Aycock believed that in order for his
service to become operational, he needed at least 300 air taxi operators in the
United States to agree to participate in his air-taxi-operator network.<a
href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[131]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the years after conceiving of the idea for his
service, Mr. Aycock worked toward offering the service to the public. In the
mid&#8211;1960s, he formed Aycock Engineering&#8212;the corporate entity under
which his service would operate. He also sought and obtained two toll-free
telephone numbers that the public could use to make reservations. In March of
1970, Mr. Aycock invited virtually all air taxi operators certified by the
Federal Aviation Administration (�FAA�) to join his operation by, inter alia,
distributing flyers with in-depth information about his AIRFLITE service. He
eventually entered into contracts with some of those air taxi service
operators.<a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[132]</span></span></span></a>
Under these contracts, air taxi operators agreed to participate in the AIRFLITE
service and even paid modest initiation fees to Mr. Aycock. Furthermore, Mr.
Aycock filed a service mark application on August 10, 1970 for the term
AIRFLITE, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Despite his efforts, Mr. Aycock's operation never
got off the ground. While he estimated that he needed at least 300 air service
operators under contract to make his service operational, Mr. Aycock never had
more than twelve (4% of his minimum goal) under contract at any time throughout
his company's history. And while Mr. Aycock advertised to air taxi operators,
he never marketed the AIRFLITE service to the general public. More
specifically, the record does not suggest that Mr. Aycock ever gave the public
an opportunity to use the toll-free phone numbers to book reservations, or that
he ever spoke with a member of the general public about making a reservation.
Finally, and most notably, Mr. Aycock never arranged for a single passenger to
fly on a chartered flight.<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[133]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Aycock's AIRFLITE mark, which he applied for on
August 10, 1970, was registered by the USPTO on April 30, 1974 on the
Supplemental Register<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[134]</span></span></span></a>
after a prosecution that involved considerable negotiation between Mr. Aycock
and the trademark examining attorney�. The recitation of services for the
AIRFLITE service mark eventually agreed upon by the USPTO and Mr. Aycock was
�[a]rranging for individual reservations for flights on airplanes.� <i>Id.</i>
at 729. Mr. Aycock's application to renew his AIRFLITE service mark was granted
by the USPTO on April 27, 1994.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 2001, Airflite, Inc., the
Petitioner&#8211;Appellee, filed a petition for cancellation alleging, inter
alia, that Aycock Engineering did not use its AIRFLITE mark prior to
registration in connection with the services identified in its registration. In
that proceeding, the TTAB agreed with Airflite, Inc. and cancelled the AIRFLITE
registration, finding that Mr. Aycock failed to render the service described in
its registration in commerce. <i>Airflite, Inc. v. Aycock Eng'g, Inc.,</i>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>D. Use Requirement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under � 45 of the Lanham Act, a service mark is any
�word, name, symbol or device, or any combination thereof used by a person, or
which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce ... to identify and
distinguish the services of one person ... from the services of others.� 15
U.S.C. � 1127 (2006). The definition of �service mark� is virtually identical
to the definition of �trademark.� But while service marks apply to intangible
services, trademarks are used to distinguish tangible goods. <i>See Chance v.
Pac&#8211;Tel Teletrac Inc.,</i> 242 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th&nbsp; Cir.2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �It is clear from the wording of the Lanham Act
that applications for service mark registrations are subject to the same
statutory criteria as are trademarks.� 3 J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i> � 19:82 (4th ed.2008) [hereinafter
McCarthy]; see 15 U.S.C. � 1053 (2006). One such statutory criterion that
applies to both trademarks and service marks is the �use in commerce�
requirement.� The registration of a mark that does not meet the use requirement
is void ab initio. <i>See</i> <i>Gay Toys, Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.,</i> 585
F.2d 1067, 1068 (CCPA 1978); 3 McCarthy � 19:112.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Despite the seeming harmony and simplicity in the
application of the use requirement to trademarks and service marks, opportunity
exists for confusion in this area of the law. Different statutory requirements
apply to applications filed before November 16, 1989, as compared to those
filed after. This is because in 1988, Congress passed the Trademark Law
Revision Act (�TLRA�). The TLRA altered the burden that applicants must meet
before satisfying the use element by requiring an applicant to make a �bona
fide use of [the] mark in the ordinary course of trade.� Trademark Law Revision
Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100&#8211;667, 102 Stat. 3935 (effective November 16,
1989) (codified at 15 U.S.C. � 1127 (2006)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This �bona fide use� language was intended to
eliminate �token uses,� which occurred when applicants used marks in
conjunction with selling goods or offering services for the sole purpose of
obtaining registration, and with no intention of legitimately using the mark in
commerce until a later date. See <i>Blue Bell, Inc. v. Jaymar&#8211;Ruby, Inc.,</i>
497 F.2d 433, 437 (2d Cir.1974). Before 1989, a �token use� was sufficient to
satisfy the use requirement and qualify a mark for registration. <i>See Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to eliminating token uses, the 1988
TLRA made other changes to the use requirement. Before 1989, an applicant only
qualified for registration if he was using his mark in commerce at the time he
filed his application at the USPTO. <i>WarnerVision Entm't Inc. v. Empire of
Carolina, Inc.,</i> 101 F.3d 259, 260 (2d Cir.1996). But after 1989, an
applicant could begin the registration process even when his mark was not in
use in commerce at the time of the filing, so long as he had a �bona fide
intention to use the mark in commerce� at a later date. 15 U.S.C. � 1051(b)
(2006). Applicants filing these �intent to use� applications are only granted
registration, however, if they file a verified statement of commercial use
proving eventual use of the mark in commerce. <i>Id.</i> � 1051(d).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the mark at issue here is a service mark,
the use requirement relating to service mark applications, as opposed to
trademark applications, guides our analysis. Furthermore, the application at
issue in this case was filed in 1970. Therefore, this case must be decided
according to the service mark use requirement that appeared in the Lanham Act
in 1970 (i.e., the pre&#8211;1989 version). <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy � 19:112.
However, for the reasons stated below, our holding in this case also applies to
the current (and post&#8211;1989) service mark use requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>E. Use Requirement for Service Marks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With the exception of the 1988 TLRA statutory
language eliminating token uses and permitting intent-to-use applications, the
service mark use requirement as it appeared in 1970 is materially identical to
the post&#8211;1989 version. The use provision of the Lanham Act in force in
1970 stated that a service mark was in use in commerce �when it is used or
displayed in the sale or advertising of services, and the services are rendered
in commerce, or the services are rendered in more than one State or in this and
a foreign country and the person rendering the services is engaged in commerce
in connection therewith.� Pub.L. No. 87&#8211;772, 76 Stat. 769 (1962).
Therefore, like the current use requirement, a service mark applicant seeking
to meet the pre&#8211;1989 version had to (1) use the mark in the sale or
advertising of a service and (2) show that the service was either rendered in
interstate commerce or rendered in more than one state or in this and a foreign
country by a person engaged in commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Courts, as well as the TTAB, have interpreted the
pre&#8211;1989 statutory language in analogous cases. Without question,
advertising or publicizing a service that the applicant intends to perform in
the future will not support registration. <i>In re Cedar Point, Inc.,</i> 220
USPQ 533, 536 (TTAB 1983) (quoting <i>Intermed Commc'ns, Inc. v. Chaney,</i>
197 USPQ 501, 507&#8211;08 (TTAB 1977)); <i>Greyhound Corp. v. Armour Life Ins.
Co.,</i> 214 USPQ 473, 474 (TTAB 1982). Instead, the advertising or publicizing
must relate to �an existing service which has already been offered to the
public.� <i>Greyhound,</i> 214 USPQ at 474. Furthermore, �[m]ere adoption
(selection) of a mark accompanied by preparations to begin its use are
insufficient ... for claiming ownership of and applying to register the mark.� <i>Intermed,</i>
197 USPQ at 507; <i>see Blue Bell,</i> 497 F.2d at 437. �At the very least,� in
order for an applicant to meet the use requirement, �there must be an open and
notorious public offering of the services to those for whom the services are
intended.� <i>Intermed,</i> 197 USPQ at 507.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Intermed,</i> the TTAB rejected a service
mark application for failing to meet the use in commerce requirement even where
the applicant had performed many pre-application service-oriented activities
involving the public. <i>Id.</i> at 508&#8211;09. The applicant in that case
sought to register a mark intended to identify an international medical services
operation. <i>Id.</i> at 502. The applicant's plan was to build the
international service from an already operating United States-based medical
service. <i>Id.</i> at 503. The applicant intended to, and did use the United
States-based operation as a fundraising affiliate of the new international
operation. <i>Id.</i> at 504. Additionally, the applicant communicated with and
solicited the support of the Iranian government regarding the service before
the application was filed. <i>Id.</i> The applicant also issued a detailed
announcement using the service mark term before the filing date designed to
inform and update individuals about the service's status. <i>Id.</i> Finally,
and also before the date of application, the applicant hired a fundraising firm
to raise money for the service. <i>Id.</i> at 508.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Despite these activities, the TTAB held that the
applicant failed to meet the use requirement because the services described in
the application were not �offered, promoted, advertised or rendered ... in
commerce.� <i>Intermed,</i> 197 USPQ at 504. The TTAB stated that �[t]he
statute requires not only the display of the mark in the sale or advertising of
services but also the rendition of those services in order to constitute use of
the service mark in commerce.� <i>Id.</i> At 507&#8211;08. The TTAB further
explained that adopting a mark accompanied by mere �preparations to begin its
use� is insufficient for service mark registration, and that in order for the
use requirement to be met, there must be �an open and notorious public offering
of the services to those for whom the services are intended.� <i>Id.</i> at
507.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1983, the TTAB again rejected a service mark
application because it failed to meet the use requirement. <i>Cedar Point,</i>
220 USPQ at 533. In <i>Cedar Point,</i> the Cedar Point amusement park, which
had been in business for decades, was preparing to open a new water park
addition in mid-May of 1980. <i>Id.</i> at 535. One preparatory step taken by
Cedar Point before opening day was the filing of a service mark application to
register the mark �OCEANA� for its new water park service. <i>Id.</i> Cedar
Point also distributed nearly 700,000 water park advertisement brochures
containing the OCEANA mark during the months preceding the grand opening. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The TTAB emphasized the fact that Cedar Point filed
its service mark application with the USPTO before it opened the water park's
doors and offered those services to the public. <i>Id.</i> at 535&#8211;36. The
TTAB then explained that the use of a mark in connection with the advertising
of services intended to be �available at some time in the future, but not yet
available at the time of filing� does not qualify the mark for registration. <i>Id.</i>
at 535. Therefore, Cedar Point's water park advertising campaign, which was
ongoing at the time the application was filed, was insufficient on its own to
support registration. <i>Id.</i> As a result, the TTAB held that the
�applicant's mark �OCEANA� was not in �use in commerce� ... at the time of the
filing of [the] application� and that the application was thus void ab initio. <i>Id.</i>
at 537.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Interestingly, Cedar Point filed for its service mark
roughly one month before the scheduled opening of the new water park. <i>Id.</i>
at 535. With the application date being so close to the opening date, it is
indisputable that Cedar Point had taken numerous steps toward constructing the
water park by the time the application was filed. Nevertheless, the TTAB found
none of these preparatory steps sufficient to satisfy the use in commerce
requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The TTAB also addressed the use in commerce issue
in the 1982 <i>Greyhound</i> case. <i>Greyhound,</i> 214 USPQ at 473. In that
case, the applicant, a life insurance company, filed a service mark application
in November of 1979. <i>Id.</i> at 474. Before the filing date, the applicant
advertised its services by disseminating informational letters and posters
using the service mark. <i>Id.</i> Despite this activity, the TTAB held that
the service described in the application was not rendered in commerce and thus
declared the application void ab initio. <i>Id.</i> at 475. The TTAB explained
that �it is well settled that advertising of a service, without performance of
a service, will not support registration.... The use in advertising which
creates a right in a service mark must be advertising which relates to an
existing service which has already been offered to the public.� <i>Id.</i> at
474.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We find the reasoning of these cases persuasive.
The language of the statute, by requiring that the mark be �used or displayed
in the sale or advertising of services, and the services are rendered in
commerce,� makes plain that advertisement and actual use of the mark in
commerce are required; mere preparations to use that mark sometime in the
future will not do. Thus, we hold that an applicant's preparations to use a
mark in commerce are insufficient to constitute use in commerce. Rather, the
mark must be actually used in conjunction with the services described in the
application for the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>F. Analysis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But these activities, even taken together, do not
constitute a service that falls within the scope of our definition of the
recitation of services. As mentioned earlier, it is our view that the service
described in Mr. Aycock's service mark application covers only the arranging of
flights between an air taxi operator and a passenger, and not preparatory
efforts to arrange a network of air taxi operators. The activities described
above, however, were merely preparatory steps that Mr. Aycock took toward his
goal of one day, as he described, operating a �communication service between
persons desiring to charter aircraft� that �put[ ] individuals desiring air
transportation in contact with people rendering that service.� J.A. 736, 749.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In order for Mr. Aycock to satisfy the use
requirement, more was required. Mr. Aycock had to develop his company to the
point where he made an open and notorious public offering of his AIRFLITE
service to intended customers. <i>See Intermed,</i> 197 USPQ at 507. However,
at no point in time did Mr. Aycock give a potential customer the chance to use
his AIRFLITE service. He never arranged for a single flight between a customer
and an air taxi operator. This is because Mr. Aycock, as stated in his
deposition, believed he needed at least 300 air taxi operators under contract
before his service could become operational. Reasonably, because he never had
more than twelve air taxi operators under contract at any one time, Mr. Aycock
chose not to open his doors to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court affirmed the TTAB�s cancellation of Aycock�s
mark.&nbsp; Note that Judge Newman dissented on the ground that,
notwithstanding the description of services listed in the registration that was
finally agreed to by Aycock, �it is inappropriate now to construe the
registration so as to exclude the actual use of the mark as was explained in
the examination, shown in the specimens, and fully explored in the public
record of the prosecution.�</i>&nbsp; <i>Aycock Eng�g</i>, 560 F.3d at 1365

<p class=NormalNoIndent>I. <i>Development and Distribution of the �Coolmail�
Software</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In late 1994, Byron Darrah (�Darrah�) developed a
UNIX-based program (the �Software�) that provides e-mail users with notice of
new e-mail and serves as a gateway to the users' e-mail application. On December
31, 1994, Darrah distributed the Software over the Internet by posting it on a
UNIX user site called �Sunsite,� from which it could be downloaded for free.
Darrah had named the Software �Coolmail� and this designation appeared on the
announcement sent to the end-users on Sunsite as well as on the Software
user-manual, both of which accompanied the release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Software was distributed without charge to
users pursuant to a GNU General Public License that also accompanied the
release. A GNU General Public License allows users to copy, distribute and/or
modify the Software under certain restrictions, e.g., users modifying licensed
files must carry �prominent notices� stating that the user changed the files
and the date of any change. After the release of the Software, Darrah received
correspondence from users referencing the �Coolmail� mark and in some cases
suggesting improvements. In 1995, Darrah released two subsequent versions of
the Software under the same mark and also pursuant to the GNU General Public
License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In early 1995, a German company named S.u.S.E. GmbH
sought permission from Darrah to include the Software in a CD-ROM package sold
as a compilation of Unix-based programs. Darrah consented and, pursuant to the
GNU licensing agreement, S.u.S.E. distributed the Software in its compilation
product and in subsequent versions thereof. S.u.S.E. sold and continues to sell
the software compilation in stores in the United States and abroad, as well as
over the Internet.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>II. <i>Launch of Techsplosion's �CoolMail� E-mail
Service</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1998, Appellant Carson formed Techsplosion, for
the purpose of operating a business based on an e-mail service that he had
developed. On April 16, 1998, Techsplosion began offering the e-mail service on
the Internet under the mark �CoolMail.� Two days later, Techsplosion activated
the domain name �coolmail.to�. Techsplosion delivered an e-mail solicitation
under the �CoolMail� mark to approximately 11,000 members of the Paramount
Banner Network, an Internet advertising network, also created and operated by
Carson. Techsplosion charged no fee to subscribe to the service and generated
revenues through the sale of banner advertisements on its web site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellee Planetary Motion is a computer software
and telecommunications company that developed and owns an electronic mail
service called �Coolmail.� As part of its service, Planetary Motion enables a
person to check e-mail via telephone without logging onto a computer. On April
24, 1998, Planetary Motion filed three intent-to-use applications to register
the mark �Coolmail� with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Though
Planetary Motion was aware that Darrah's Software also bore the mark
�Coolmail,� it represented in its applications that it was not aware of any
mark upon which its proposed registered mark would infringe. Planetary Motion
launched its Coolmail e-mail service to subscribers on June 8, 1998.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>IV. <i>Planetary Motion's Complaint
and Subsequent Acquisition of Darrah's Rights</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On April 22, 1999, Planetary Motion filed a
complaint against Techsplosion. In the complaint, Planetary Motion alleged
infringement of the alleged mark �Coolmail� for use in connection with e-mail
services. Planetary alleged federal trademark infringement and unfair
competition under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a), as well
as injury to business reputation and dilution under Florida Statute � 495.151.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On June 10, 1999, Techsplosion filed an Answer,
Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaims. The counterclaims alleged infringement
of the mark �Coolmail� for use in connection with e-mail services. Techsplosion
alleged unfair competition, false designation, description, and representation
under the Lanham Act, common trademark infringement, common law unfair
competition, and injury to business reputation and dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

violation of trademark rights assigned from Darrah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

Motion's Complaint</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On January 31, 2000, the district court entered an
Order granting Planetary Motion's motion for summary judgment and denying
Carson's and Techsplosion's motion for summary judgment. The district court
based the Order on two findings: (1) that the alleged mark was affixed to
Darrah's software, and that Darrah's distribution of the software over the
Internet constituted a �transport in commerce,� resulting in the creation of
trademark rights and priority, and (2) there was a likelihood of confusion
because the marks �are essentially the same.� The district court did not reach
the issue of whether Techsplosion's use of �CoolMail� in connection with its
e-mail service diluted Planetary Motion's mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the same date, the district court entered final
judgment granting Planetary Motion permanent injunctive relief.&nbsp; <i>See</i>
15 U.S.C. � 1116. The order also awarded Planetary Motion profits and damages,
as well as attorney fees and costs, pursuant to section 35 of the Lanham Act,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act forbids unfair
trade practices involving infringement of trade dress, service marks, or
trademarks, even in the absence of federal trademark registration. <i>Two
Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992)�. To prevail
under this section, a claimant must show (1) that it had prior rights to the
mark at issue and (2) that the defendant had adopted a mark or name that was
the same, or confusingly similar to its mark, such that consumers were likely
to confuse the two. <i>Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Longhorn
Steaks, Inc.,</i> 106 F.3d 355, 360 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <i>Conagra Inc. v.
Singleton,</i> 743 F.2d 1508, 1512 (11th Cir.1984)), <i>modified,</i> 122 F.3d
1379 (1997). Appellants argue that the district court erred in finding that
Planetary Motion had established both elements. Appellants also dispute the
scope of injunctive relief, as well as the award of attorney fees and costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>I. <i>Prior Use in Commerce</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under common law, trademark ownership rights are
�appropriated only through actual prior use in commerce.� <i>Tally-Ho, Inc. v.
Coast Community College Dist.,</i> 889 F.2d 1018, 1022 (11th Cir.1989)
(citation omitted). Under the Lanham Act,<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[136]</span></span></span></a>
the term �use in commerce� is defined in � 15 U.S.C. � 1127.<a href="#_ftn137"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[137]</span></span></span></a> The district court found
that because the statute is written in the disjunctive (i.e., �sale <i>or</i>
transport�), Darrah's wide distribution of the Coolmail software over the
Internet, even absent any sales thereof, was sufficient to establish ownership
rights in the �CoolMail� mark. Appellants contend that �transport in commerce�
alone&#8212;here, Darrah's free distribution of software over the Internet
�with no existing business, no intent to form a business, and no sale under the
mark�&#8212;is insufficient to create trademark rights. Appellants' Brief at
13. Appellants' argument lacks merit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The parties do not make clear the two different
contexts in which the phrase �use in commerce� is used. The term �use in
commerce� as used in the Lanham Act �denotes Congress's authority under the
Commerce Clause rather than an intent to limit the [Lanham] Act's application
to profit making activity.� <i>United We Stand Am., Inc. v. United We Stand,
Am. N.Y., Inc.,</i> 128 F.3d 86, 92-93 (2d Cir.1997) (citation omitted), <i>cert.
denied,</i> 523 U.S. 1076 (1998); U.S. Const., Art. I, � 8, cl. 3. Because
Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause extends to activity that
�substantially affects� interstate commerce, <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514
U.S. 549, 559 (1995), the Lanham Act's definition of �commerce� is
concomitantly broad in scope: �all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by
Congress.� 15 U.S.C. � 1127. <i>See also Steele v. Bulova Watch Co.,</i> 344
U.S. 280, 283-84 (1952); <i>Larry Harmon Pictures Corp. v. Williams Rest.
Corp.,</i> 929 F.2d 662, 666 (Fed.Cir.) (allowing registration for an
intrastate provider of restaurant services with an undefined interstate
clientele), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 823 (1991). The distribution of the
Software for end-users over the Internet satisfies the �use in commerce�
jurisdictional predicate. <i>See, e.g., Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., Inc.
v. Bucci,</i> 42 U.S.P.Q.2d 1430, 1434 (S.D.N.Y.1997) ( �The nature of the
Internet indicates that establishing a typical home page on the Internet, for
access to all users, would satisfy the Lanham Act's �in commerce�
requirement.�), <i>aff'd,</i> 152 F.3d 920 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525
U.S. 834 (1998).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nevertheless, the use of a mark in commerce also
must be sufficient to establish <i>ownership rights</i> for a plaintiff to
recover against subsequent users under section 43(a). <i>See New England
Duplicating Co. v. Mendes,</i> 190 F.2d 415, 417-18 (1st Cir.1951) (after
finding �use in commerce� jurisdiction predicate satisfied, court noted that
�[t]he question remains whether the plaintiff has established that he was the
�owner� of the mark, for under [15 U.S.C. � 1051] only the �owner� of a mark is
entitled to have it registered.�). The court in <i>Mendes</i> set forth a two
part test to determine whether a party has established �prior use� of a mark
sufficient to establish ownership:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[E]vidence showing, first, adoption,<a href="#_ftn138"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[138]</span></span></span></a> and, second, use in a way
sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the marked goods in an
appropriate segment of the public mind as those of the adopter of the mark, is
competent to establish ownership, even without evidence of actual sales.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Courts generally must inquire into the activities
surrounding the prior use of the mark to determine whether such an association
or notice is present. <i>See, e.g., Johnny Blastoff, Inc. v. L.A. Rams Football
Co.,</i> 188 F.3d 427, 433 (7th Cir.1999) (�The determination of whether a party
has established protectable rights in a trademark is made on a case by case
basis, considering the totality of the circumstances.�), <i>cert. denied,</i>
528 U.S. 1188, (2000). Under the �totality of circumstances� analysis, a party
may establish �use in commerce� even in the absence of sales. �[A]lthough
evidence of sales is highly persuasive, the question of use adequate to
establish appropriation remains one to be decided on the facts of each case
....� <i>New West,</i> 595 F.2d at 1200 (quoting <i>Mendes,</i> 190 F.2d at
418). The court in <i>New West</i> recognized that �mere advertising by itself
may not establish priority of use,� but found that promotional mailings coupled
with advertiser and distributor solicitations met the <i>Mendes</i> �public
identification� ownership requirement. <i>Id.</i> at 1200. Thus, contrary to
Appellants' assertions, the existence of sales or lack thereof does not by
itself determine whether a user of a mark has established ownership rights
therein.<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" title=""><span

are <i>de minimis</i> may not establish trademark ownership rights. <i>See,
e.g., Paramount Pictures Corp. v. White,</i> 31 U.S.P.Q.2d 1768, 1772-73, 1994
WL 484936 (Trademark Tr. &amp; App. Bd.1994) (finding no bona fide use in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We find that, under these principles, Darrah's
activities under the �Coolmail� mark constitute a �use in commerce�
sufficiently public to create ownership rights in the mark. First, the
distribution was widespread, and there is evidence that members of the targeted
public actually associated the mark Coolmail with the Software to which it was
affixed. Darrah made the software available not merely to a discrete or select
group (such as friends and acquaintances, or at a trade show with limited
attendance), but to numerous end-users via the Internet. The Software was
posted under a filename bearing the �Coolmail� mark on a site accessible to
anyone who had access to the Internet. End-users communicated with Darrah
regarding the Software by referencing the �Coolmail� mark in their e-mails.
Appellants argue that only technically-skilled UNIX-users made use of the
Software, but there is no evidence that they were so few in number to warrant a
finding of <i>de minimis</i> use.</p>

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[144]</span></span></span></a>
the mark served to identify the source of the Software. The �Coolmail� mark
appeared in the subject field and in the text of the announcement accompanying
each release of the Software, thereby distinguishing the Software from other
programs that might perform similar functions available on the Internet or sold
in software compilations.<a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[145]</span></span></span></a>
The announcements also apparently indicated that Darrah was the
�Author/Maintainer of Coolmail� and included his e-mail address. The user

was unaware that the Software was called �Coolmail� when it contacted Darrah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fourth, other potential users of the mark had
notice that the mark was in use in connection with Darrah's Software. In
investigating whether the mark Coolmail existed before submitting its trademark
registration application for its e-mail service, Planetary Motion was able to
discover that Darrah was using the mark to designate his Software product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fifth, the Software was incorporated into several
versions of a product that was in fact sold worldwide and specifically
attributed ownership of the Software to Darrah under the �Coolmail� mark. Any
individual using the S.u.S.E. product, or competitor of S.u.S.E., that wanted
to know the source of the program that performed the e-mail notification
function, could do so by referring to the user manual accompanying the product.
There is no support for the argument that for a trademark in software to be
valid, the mark must appear on the box containing the product incorporating it,
that the mark must be displayed on the screen when the program is running, or
that the software bearing the mark be a selling point for the product into
which it is incorporated. There is no requirement that the public come to
associate a mark with a product in any particular way or that the public
be&nbsp; passive viewers of a mark for a sufficient public association to
arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Sixth, software is commonly distributed without
charge under a GNU General Public License. The sufficiency of use should be
determined according to the customary practices of a particular industry. <i>See</i>
S. Rep. 100-515 at 44 (1988) (�The committee intends that the revised
definition of �use in commerce� [see note 13, <i>supra</i> ] be interpreted to
mean commercial use <i>which is typical in a particular industry.</i>�)
(emphasis added). That the Software had been distributed pursuant to a GNU
General Public License does not defeat trademark ownership, nor does this in
any way compel a finding that Darrah abandoned his rights in trademark.
Appellants misconstrue the function of a GNU General Public License. Software
distributed pursuant to such a license is not necessarily ceded to the public
domain and the licensor purports to retain ownership rights, which may or may
not include rights to a mark.<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellants also rely on <i>DeCosta v. Columbia
Broad. Sys., Inc.,</i> 520 F.2d 499, 513 (1st Cir.1975), <i>cert. denied,</i>
423 U.S. 1073 (1976), to argue that Darrah is an eleemosynary individual and
therefore unworthy of protection under unfair competition laws. The <i>DeCosta</i>
court did not hold that the that the absence of a profit-oriented enterprise
renders one an eleemosynary individual, nor did it hold that such individuals
categorically are denied protection. Rather, the <i>DeCosta</i> court expressed
�misgivings� of extending common law unfair competition protection, clearly
available to eleemosynary organizations, to eleemosynary individuals.<a
href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[148]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; <i>Id.</i> The
court's reluctance to extend protection to eleemosynary individuals was based
on an apparent difficulty in establishing a line of demarcation between those
eleemosynary individuals engaged in commerce and those that are not. But as the
sufficiency of use to establish trademark ownership is inherently fact-driven,
the court need not have based its decision on such a consideration. <i>Mendes,</i>
190 F.2d at 418. Common law unfair competition protection extends to non-profit
organizations because they nonetheless engage in <i>competition</i> with other
organizations. <i>See Girls Clubs of Am., Inc. v. Boys Clubs of Am., Inc.,</i>
683 F.Supp. 50 (S.D.N.Y.1988), <i>aff'd,</i> 859 F.2d 148 (2d Cir.). Thus, an
eleemosynary individual that uses a mark in connection with a good or service
may nonetheless acquire ownership rights in the mark if there is sufficient
evidence of competitive activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> One individual can invest time, effort and money in
developing software or other technologically-based goods or services that would
be of interest to a multitude of users, other developers, and retail
establishments. In fact, the program was of sufficient interest for S.u.S.E. to
put effort into including it in its own software which was sold for profit,
including the effort of obtaining Darrah's permission under the GNU General
Public License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, Darrah's activities bear elements of
competition, notwithstanding his lack of an immediate profit-motive. By
developing and distributing software under a particular mark, and taking steps
to avoid ceding the Software to the public domain, Darrah made efforts to
retain ownership rights in his Software and to ensure that his Software would
be distinguishable from other developers who may have distributed similar or
related Software. Competitive activity need not be fueled solely by a desire
for direct monetary gain. Darrah derived value from the distribution because he
was able to improve his Software based on suggestions sent by end-users. Just
as any other consumers, these end-users discriminate among and share
information on available software. It is logical that as the Software improved,
more end-users used his Software, thereby increasing Darrah's recognition in
his profession and the likelihood that the Software would be improved even
further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In light of the foregoing, the use of the mark in
connection with the Software constitutes significant and substantial public
exposure of a mark sufficient to have created an association in the mind of
public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court went on to find a likelihood of confusion

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Comments and
Questions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The �totality of
the circumstances� test</i>.&nbsp; <i>Aycock Engineering</i> stands for the
proposition that, as a general matter, the use of a mark merely in pre-sales
advertising or merely in preparation to sell goods or services does not
constitute �use in commerce� under � 45.&nbsp; Yet <i>Planetary Motion</i>
points out that the actual sale of goods or services bearing the mark may also
be insufficient to constitute use in commerce.&nbsp; So how can courts
determine what kind and degree of pre-sales and/or sales activity can satisfy
the use in commerce requirement?&nbsp; Most courts have adopted some form of a
�totality of the circumstances� test, sometime heavily influenced by the
equities of the case.&nbsp; <i>See La Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v.
Jean Patou, Inc</i>., 495 F.2d 1265, 1274 n. 11 (2d Cir.1974) (�[T]he balance
of the equities plays an important role in deciding whether defendant's use is
sufficient to warrant trademark protection.�).&nbsp; In <i>Chance v. Pac-Tel
Teletrac Inc</i>., 242 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2001), for example, the Ninth
Circuit summarized the factors that might be relevant to a totality of the
circumstances analysis of use in commerce sufficient to justify rights:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Accordingly, we hold that the totality of the circumstances
must be employed to determine whether a service mark has been adequately used
in commerce so as to gain the protection of the Lanham Act. In applying this
approach, the district courts should be guided in their consideration of
non-sales activities by factors we have discussed, such as the genuineness and
commercial character of the activity, the determination of whether the mark was
sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the marked service in an
appropriate segment of the public mind as those of the holder of the mark, the
scope of the non-sales activity relative to what would be a commercially
reasonable attempt to market the service, the degree of ongoing activity of the
holder to conduct the business using the mark, the amount of business
transacted, and other similar factors which might distinguish whether a service
has actually been �rendered in commerce�.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1159.&nbsp; Applying these factors, the
Ninth Circuit found that the October 1989 mailing by Allen Chance (�Chance�) of
35,000 postcards promoting his <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>teletrac</span>
tracking service that led to 128 telephone responses but no sales was not
sufficient to establish use in commerce.&nbsp; Meanwhile,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Pac&#8211;Tel, in contrast, had significant activities even
prior to [Chance�s] post card mailing. The record demonstrates that as early as
June 1989, Pac&#8211;Tel began using the mark on a continuous basis. As early
as 1984, a Pac&#8211;Tel predecessor company was using the mark as part of its
business name. Pac&#8211;Tel began a public relations campaign using the mark
to introduce its new service in July 1989. In September 1989, it sent out
brochures to potential customers. In early fall 1989, it conducted interviews
with major newspapers including the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Washington
Post</i> and <i>Chicago Tribune</i> which resulted in a number of stories that
mentioned the service mark. During this time the service was marketed to
potential customers who managed large vehicle fleets through a slide
presentation using the mark. While the district court found that
Pac&#8211;Tel's first use was in April 1990, when it began making its service
available on a commercial basis for the first time on the Los Angeles school
buses, the totality of the record demonstrates that its first use of the mark was
significantly earlier and clearly predated [Chance]'s first use</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1160.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another example of the application of the totality of the
circumstances test, along with a strong grounding in the balance of the
equities, is <i>Johnny Blastoff, Inc. v. Los Angeles Rams Football Co</i>., 188
F.3d 427 (7th Cir. 1999).&nbsp; When the Los Angeles Rams announced that they
were moving to St. Louis, Rodney Rigsby, proprietor of Johnny Blastoff, Inc.,
had the bright idea somehow to claim ownership of the <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>st. louis rams</span> mark before the football team could.&nbsp; He
filed a State of Wisconsin trademark application on February 22, 1995, and two
federal intent-to-use registration applications in March 10, 1995.&nbsp; The
court found that the football team�s use in commerce preceded these dates. Here
is the core of the court�s analysis:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>On January 17, 1995, Georgia
Frontiere, the owner of the Rams, and St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley held a
press conference at which they announced the Rams' intention to relocate from
Los Angeles to St. Louis. The press conference story received extensive
national and local press, including the <i>St. Louis Dispatch's</i>
publication, on January 18, 1995, of a sixteen-page pullout section of the
newspaper entitled �St. Louis Rams.� Vendors sold unlicensed �St. Louis Rams�
merchandise in the St. Louis area in January of 1995, and by February of 1995,
more than 72,000 personal seat licenses for the St. Louis Rams' home games had
been received. By the time Blastoff registered the �St. Louis Rams� mark in
Wisconsin in February of 1995, a significant portion of the public associated
the mark with the Rams football club. However, Blastoff asserts that the
defendants had not sufficiently used the mark �St. Louis Rams� to be given
priority. Blastoff argues that at the January 17, 1995, press conference, none
of the defendants used the words �St. Louis Rams,� and thus, this term was
rendered an �unarticulated idea for a team name,� which is not protectable.
Blastoff also states that newspaper and media coverage is insufficient to establish
priority. Finally, Blastoff contends that the football club �operated publicly
and exclusively as [the] �L.A. Rams' � as late as February 8, 1995.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>For the purpose of establishing
public identification of a mark with a product or service, the fact-finder may
rely on the use of the mark in �advertising brochures, catalogs, newspaper ads,
and articles in newspapers and trade publications,� <i>T.A.B. Systems v. Pactel
Teletrac,</i> 77 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed.Cir.1996), as well as in media outlets
such as television and radio. <i>See In re Owens&#8211;Corning Fiberglas Corp.</i>,
774 F.2d 1116, 1125 (Fed.Cir.1985). In addition, courts have recognized that
�abbreviations and nicknames of trademarks or names used <i>only</i> by the
public give rise to protectable rights in the owners of the trade name or mark
which the public modified.� <i>Nat'l Cable Television Assoc. v. Am. Cinema
Editors, Inc.</i>, 937 F.2d 1572, 1577 (Fed.Cir.1991). Such public use of a
mark is deemed to be on behalf of the mark's owners. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i>
Blastoff has failed to demonstrate any equivalent use of the mark �St. Louis
Rams� by February of 1995, when the defendants established, by use and public
association, their priority in the mark. Blastoff's insignificant and very
limited use of the mark prior to February of 1995, consisting of the
development of the �Tower City Rams� design, along with the production of a
swatch of material with �St. Louis Rams� embroidery, is insufficient to
establish a link between the mark and its products. Furthermore, the owner's
use of a trademark is relevant in establishing public identification of a mark
with a product or service. Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams, in announcing
her intention to move the franchise to St. Louis from Los Angeles, implicitly
adopted the exact phrase �St. Louis Rams� on the date of her press conference.
This Court's decision in <i>Indianapolis Colts, Inc. v. Metropolitan Baltimore
Football Club Ltd</i>., 34 F.3d 410, 413 (7th Cir.1994), is strong support for
the proposition that the Rams organization and the NFL had a long-established
priority over the use of the �Rams� name in connection with the same
professional football team, regardless of urban affiliation.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 435.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �<i>Stealing� someone
else�s idea for a trademark</i>.&nbsp; Because use, rather than invention, is
the basis for trademark rights under the Lanham Act, there is no remedy under
the Act for the �theft� of an idea for a trademark.&nbsp; In <i>American
Express Co. v. Goetz</i>, 515 F.3d 156 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct.
176 (U.S. 2008), the declaratory defendant Stephen Goetz developed the slogan
�My Life. My Card.� for a credit card and sought to interest various credit
card providers in using it and his consulting services.&nbsp; On July 30, 2004,
Goetz mailed a proposal to American Express urging American Express to adopt
the mark.&nbsp; American Express never responded.&nbsp; In November, 2004,
however, American Express launched a global campaign based on the phrase �My
Life. My Card.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Goetz threatened suit, American Express filed for a
declaration of non-infringement.&nbsp; Documents produced in the litigation
showed that the advertising firm Ogilvy Group first proposed the mark to
American Express on July 22, 2004, and Goetz eventually conceded that Ogilvy
had developed and American Express had adopted the mark without any knowledge
of his proposal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The district court granted summary judgment to American
Express and the Second Circuit affirmed.&nbsp; What drove the outcome of the
litigation was not the priority of invention issue, however.&nbsp; Instead, it
was the simple fact that Goetz never made a qualifying use in commerce of the
mark: �[C]onstruing all the facts in Goetz's favor, the only reasonable
conclusion that can be drawn is that My Life, My Card was a component of
Goetz's business proposal to the credit card companies rather than a mark
designating the origin of any goods or services he offered to them.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Trademark trolls
and the use in commerce requirement</i>.&nbsp; The use in commerce prerequisite
for trademark rights has the salutary effect of limiting the ability of bad
faith agents to exploit the trademark registration system in the way that
�non-practicing entities� arguably exploit the patent system.&nbsp; In <i>Central
Mfg., Inc. v. Brett</i>, 492 F.3d 876 (9th Cir. 2007), the defendant George
Brett (and brothers) manufactured a hybrid wood-metal bat under the trademark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>stealth</span>.&nbsp; Plaintiff Central Mfg.,
of which the then-notorious trademark troll Leo Stoller was president and sole
shareholder, sued for infringement of its own mark stealth, which it had
registered in 1985 for �[s]porting goods, specifically, tennis rackets, golf
clubs, tennis balls, basketballs, baseballs, soccer balls, golf balls, cross
bows, tennis racket strings and shuttle cocks.�&nbsp; When Brett challenged
Stoller to produce any evidence of use in commerce of the mark, Stoller�s
documents failed to persuade the district court.&nbsp; For example: �Plaintiffs
produced a table of �Stealth Brand Baseball Sales� between 1996 and 2003, but
could provide absolutely no information to justify the lump sum �sales� figures
listed. There is no way for this Court to know that this alleged sales sheet
bears any relation to reality and is not simply something Plaintiffs generated
on a home computer for the purposes of this litigation.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at
883 (quoting Central Mfg. Co. v. Brett, 2006 WL 681058 (N.D.Ill. Mar 15, 2006)).&nbsp;
The Seventh Circuit affirmed:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Stoller has repeatedly sought ways to get around trademark
law's prohibition on the stockpiling of unused marks, and this case is no
different. It is unfathomable that a company claiming to have engaged in
thousands of dollars of sales of a product for more than a decade would be
unable to produce even a single purchase order or invoice as proof.
Self-serving deposition testimony is not enough to defeat a motion for summary
judgment. By exposing Central's failure to make bona fide use of the �Stealth�
mark for baseballs, Brett Brothers met its burden to overcome the presumption
afforded by the 1985 registration, and summary judgment in its favor was the
appropriate course.</p>

attorney fees.</p>

Trademark Registration Process</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use, rather than registration, is the basis of federal
trademark rights in the United States. As explained previously in this Part, the
Lanham Act will protect a trademark owner�s exclusive rights in any trademark
it is using in commerce regardless of whether the mark is registered provided
that the unregistered mark meets the various substantive requirements for
registration established by the Act.&nbsp; In other words, if the mark as used
in commerce could be registered, it will be protected even if it is not
registered.&nbsp; Conversely, the Lanham Act will not protect a trademark
registrant�s exclusive rights in its registered mark if it no longer uses its
mark in commerce and cannot prove an intent to resume use in the near
future.&nbsp; On this basis, it is often said that the U.S. trademark system is
a �use-based� system in contrast to the �registration-based� systems more
common around the world.<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[149]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
In the United States, registration merely records the preexistence of
externally established rights.<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[150]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The U.S. registration system is different in another
significant respect.&nbsp; Unlike most foreign registration systems, which
review applications only for compliance with formal requirements, the PTO
reviews applications to ensure that they meet both formal requirements (which
are largely set forth in Lanham Act � 1) and substantive requirements (largely
found in Lanham Act � 2).&nbsp; These substantive requirements include both
�absolute grounds� for refusal of registration, such as that the mark is
deceptive or scandalous, and �relative grounds� for refusal, such as that the
mark is confusingly similar with a previously registered or used mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A trademark applicant at the PTO must claim at least one
�filing basis� for its application among the five that are provided by the
Lanham Act.&nbsp; These filing bases are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For marks already being used in commerce, a successful
application proceeds though at least five basic stages: (1) application, (2)
examination, (3) publication in the PTO�s Official Gazette, (4) opposition, and
(5) registration. Intent-to-use applications proceed through two additional
stages following opposition and preceding registration: (4.a) the issuance by
the PTO of a �Notice of Allowance� and (4.b) the filing by the applicant of a
Statement of Use showing that the applicant has begun to make actual use of the
mark in commerce. We review each of these stages below. But first we consider
why a trademark owner should federally register its mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Registration on the Principal Register confers significant,
substantive advantages on the registered mark.&nbsp; First and perhaps most
importantly, under Lanham Act � 7(c), 15 U.S.C. � 1057, registration confers on
the registrant nationwide priority in the mark as of the date of
application.&nbsp; Section 7(c) reads as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(c) <i>Application to register mark considered constructive
use</i>. Contingent on the registration of a mark on the principal register
provided by this Act, the filing of the application to register such mark shall
constitute constructive use of the mark, conferring a right of priority,

in the registration against any other person except for a person whose mark has
not been abandoned and who, prior to such filing&#8211;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C � 1057.&nbsp; This right of priority extends
nationwide even if, as is often the case, the registrant has not itself used the

intent to use applicant enjoys nationwide priority as of its ITU application
date even if several years pass before the applicant finally makes an actual
use of its mark and completes its registration.&nbsp; (We will address the
geographic scope of trademark rights in more detail in Part I.E).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, registration confers on the mark a prima facie
presumption of the validity of the mark and the registrant�s ownership of the
mark. Lanham Act �� 7(b) &amp; 33(a), 15 U.S.C. �� 1057(b) &amp; 1115(a).&nbsp;
In practice, however, it is not clear how much weight courts place on the � 33
presumption of validity. <i>See, e.g., Custom Vehicles, Inc. v. Forest River,
Inc</i>., 476 F.3d 481, 486 (7th Cir. 2007) (�[T]he presumption of validity
that registration creates is easily rebuttable, since it merely shifts the
burden of production to the alleged infringer.�); <i>Door Systems, Inc. v.
Pro-Line Door Systems, Inc</i>., 83 F.3d 169, 172 (7th Cir. 1996) (�The
presumption of validity that federal registration confers evaporates as soon as
evidence of invalidity is presented. Its only function is to incite such evidence
and when the function has been performed the presumption drops out of the
case.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third, only marks registered on the Principal Register may
achieve incontestable status, which confers a significant benefit on
descriptive marks.&nbsp; Lanham Act �� 15 and 33, 15 U.S.C. �� 1065 &amp; 1115,
provide that at any time after the fifth year of the mark�s registration, the
registrant may file a �declaration of incontestability� that limits the grounds
upon which the mark�s validity may be contested for the remaining life of the
registration (which may be renewed in perpetuity).&nbsp; Lanham Act �� 15 and
33(b) explicitly list out these grounds; any that are not listed are
foreclosed.&nbsp; One ground not listed is that the mark is descriptive without
secondary meaning.&nbsp; Thus, the validity of descriptive marks that have
achieved incontestable status may not be challenged on the ground that they
lack secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court confirmed this rule in the notorious case
of <i>Park �N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc</i>., 469 U.S. 189 (1985). &nbsp;The
Court held that the incontestable&#8212;and clearly descriptive&#8212;mark
�Park �N Fly� for airport parking services could not be challenged on the
ground that it lacked secondary meaning, notwithstanding that the record below
strongly suggested that the mark lacked secondary meaning at the time of
registration in 1971 and still lacked secondary meaning when the case was being
litigated in the early 1980s.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 211 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting).<a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal>Registration confers additional benefits on the trademark
owner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

actions arising under �this chapter, without regard to the amount in
controversy or to diversity or lack of diversity of the citizenship of the
parties.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Owners of registered marks may obtain statutory damages against
counterfeiters.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 35(c) (statutory damages
available in �cases involving the use of a counterfeit mark�), 15 U.S.C. 1117(c),
and Lanham Act � 34(d)(1)(B)(i) (defining �counterfeit mark� as �counterfeit of
a mark that is registered on the principal register�), 15 U.S.C. �
1116(d)(1)(B)(i).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

this burden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that it is often still said that only owners of
registered marks may seek treble damages and attorney fees in exceptional cases
under Lanham Act � 35(a).&nbsp; However, the TLRA of 1988 amended Section �
35(a) to reference any �violation under section 43(a),� thus providing enhanced

<h4><a name="_Toc392009978"><a name="_Toc366060797">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration
on the Supplemental Register</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marks that fail to qualify for Principal Register
registration because they are determined to lack secondary meaning may
nevertheless seek registration on the Supplemental Register.&nbsp;
Specifically, Lanham Act Section 23(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1091(a), provides in part:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>All marks capable of distinguishing applicant's goods or
services and not registerable on the principal register provided in this
chapter, except those declared to be unregisterable under subsections (a), (b),
(c), (d), and (e)(3) of section 1052 [Lanham Act � 2] of this title, which are
in lawful use in commerce by the owner thereof, on or in connection with any
goods or services may be registered on the supplemental register upon the
payment of the prescribed fee and compliance with the provisions of subsections
(a) and (e) of section 1051 [Lanham Act � 1] of this title so far as they are
applicable.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>.&nbsp; Principal Register applicants
typically seek Supplemental Register registration (by amending their
application) only after the PTO has refused registration on the Principal
Register on the ground that the applied-for mark is descriptive and lacks
secondary meaning. As the language of � 23(a) establishes (�which are in lawful
use in commerce�), only use-based applications can be converted into
supplemental registrations; intent to use applications do not have this option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several benefits to Supplemental Register
registration:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Examiners may cite the supplemental registration against future
applications for either Principal or Supplement Register registration where the
future applied-for mark would be confusingly similar under � 2(d) with the
supplemental registration mark.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 2(d), 15 U.S.C. �
1052.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Relatedly, the mark registered on the Supplemental Register is
more likely to be detected in search reports prepared for others contemplating
the registration of similar marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Supplemental registration confers jurisdiction on federal
courts.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 39, 15 U.S.C. � 1121.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Note, however, that supplemental registration does not
provide any of the important advantages gained by principal registration.&nbsp;
It has no evidentiary or remedial significance.&nbsp; It does not establish
constructive use under � 7(c), 15 U.S.C. � 1057(c), or constructive notice of
ownership under � 22, 15 U.S.C. � 1072, nor can a supplemental registration

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The PTO provides excellent annotated flowcharts of the
registration process for each of the five filing bases on its website at:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/tm_timeline.jsp</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>The reader is very strongly encouraged to consult these
flow charts while reviewing the following information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009980"><a name="_Toc366060799">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trademark applications are filed electronically or, at
additional cost, in paper form. In 2009, 97.8 percent of trademark applications
at the PTO were filed electronically.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application is relatively
simple. See Lanham Act �� 1(a) &amp; 1(b) (setting out the required contents of
use-based and intent-to-use applications, respectively). The following are the
most important elements of the application:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>Filing Basis</i>: As
     mentioned above, the applicant must specify at least one of the five
     filing bases provided for in the Lanham Act.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>Designation of Goods and
     Services</i>: The applicant must identify the particular goods or services
     on or in connection with which it uses or intends to use the mark.&nbsp;
     The <i>U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual</i>,
     available online, provides a listing of acceptable identifications of
     goods and services. The applicant should also identify the international
     class number(s) of the identified goods or services. <i>See</i> TMEP �
     805. Importantly, this identification of goods or services does not limit
     the breadth of the applicant�s exclusive rights. The sole purpose of the
     identification of goods and services is to aid the PTO in internal
     administration and review of applications.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>Drawing</i>: The applicant
     must submit a drawing of the trademark. As of 2003, if the mark consists
     of colors, the drawing must as well. For word marks, a typed representation
     of the mark is sufficient. For nonvisual marks, such as sound or scent
     marks, the applicant need not submit a drawing. The PTO relies instead on
     the applicant�s description of the mark given elsewhere in the application
     and on the applicant�s specimen of use. TMEP � 807.09.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:-.25in'><i>Specimen of Use</i>:
     Applicants filing a �1(a)� use-based application must submit a specimen
     showing use of the mark in commerce. For electronic applications, this
     specimen typically takes the form of digital photographs of the mark
     attached to goods or .pdf images of materials promoting services.
     Applicants filing a �1(b)� intent-to-use application need not (because
     they very likely cannot) submit a specimen of use with their application,
     but must do so instead when they file their Statement of Use. See Lanham
     Act � 1(d)(1) (15 U.S.C. 1051(d)(1)).</li>
</ul>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>See</i> Lanham Act � 1, 15 U.S.C. � 1051.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For applications filed under Lanham Act � 1 or � 44, the PTO
will grant a filing date to the application according to the date on which all
of the following �minimum requirements� are received at the PTO: (1) name of
the applicant, (2) name and address for correspondence, (3) a clear drawing of
the mark; (4) a listing of the goods or services; and (5) the filing fee for at
least one class of goods or services.&nbsp; See TMEP �� 201-02.&nbsp; For
Madrid System applications filed under Lanham Act � 66(a), compliance
with&nbsp; minimum filing requirements is established by the International
Bureau at the World Intellectual Property Organization.&nbsp; (We will discuss
the Madrid System in more detail in Part I.D.4 below).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009981"><a name="_Toc366060800">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examination</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Typically within about three months from the application�s
filing date, an examining attorney will engage in a substantive examination of
the application to determine if there are any absolute or relative grounds for
refusal.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 12(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1062(a).&nbsp; With
respect to relative grounds for refusal, the examining attorney will search the
PTO�s X-Search and TESS databases (the latter of which is available online at
no charge) to determine if any marks have already been filed that may be
confusingly similar with the applied-for mark.&nbsp; If the examining attorney
finds no grounds for refusal, the attorney will approve the mark for
publication in the PTO�s Official Gazette.&nbsp; A recent study suggests that
only about 15% of use-based applications and 21% of ITU applications proceed
directly from application to approval for publication.<a href="#_ftn154"
name="_ftnref154" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[154]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the examining attorney finds grounds for refusal, he or
she will send an �Office action� to the applicant to explain the grounds for
refusal.&nbsp; The applicant has six months to respond and to amend its
application to satisfy the examiner�s objections; if the applicant fails to
respond, the application will be deemed abandoned.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act
� 12(b), 15 U.S.C. � 1062(b).&nbsp; Correspondence between the office and the
applicant will continue until either (1) the examining attorney approves the
application for publication, (2) the examining attorney issues a final Office
action refusing registration of the mark, (3) the applicant abandons the
application.&nbsp; <i>See id</i>. The applicant may appeal the final Office
action to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>

<h4><br>
<a name="_Toc392009982"><a name="_Toc366060801">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publication</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marks approved for publication are published in the PTO�s
Official Gazette (OG), a weekly online publication.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Lanham Act
� 12(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1062(a).&nbsp; Publication in the OG gives notice to the
public that the PTO plans to register the mark.&nbsp; For a 30-day period
following the date of the mark�s publication in the OG, any party that believes
it would be harmed by the registration may file an opposition to the
registration of the mark.&nbsp; The overwhelming majority of published marks
are not opposed and after the expiration of the opposition period proceed to
registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009983"><a name="_Toc366060802">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposition
and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is an administrative
board within the PTO that acts in the capacity of a trial court of first
instance in opposition, cancellation, interference, and concurrent use
proceedings and in the capacity of an appellate body in ex parte appeals from
final Office actions.&nbsp; Created in 1958, the TTAB consists of the Director
of the PTO, the Commissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for Trademarks, and
Administrative Judges appointed by the Secretary of Commerce in consultation
with the Director.&nbsp; The Director and Commissioners rarely sit on TTAB
panels.&nbsp; At this writing, there are 23 Administrative Judges on the TTAB,
all of whom are very highly experienced in trademark matters.&nbsp; The TTAB
sits in panels of three judges.&nbsp; Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual
of Procedure, available online, details all aspects of TTAB procedure.&nbsp;
Note that only those TTAB opinions that are explicitly labeled as �citable as
precedent� should be cited to the TTAB in subsequent proceedings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the terms of Lanham Act � 21, 15 U.S.C. � 1071, TTAB
judgments may be appealed either to a federal district court or to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.&nbsp; The advantage of the district court
route is that the record in the case may be supplemented with additional
evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the applicant prevails in the opposition proceeding, then
the mark proceeds to registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392009984"><a name="_Toc366060803">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With respect to use-based applications, if no opposition is
filed within thirty days or if the opposition fails, then the PTO issues a
certificate of registration and notice of the registration is published in the
Official Gazette. With respect to intent-to-use applications that are either
unopposed or unsuccessfully opposed, the PTO issues a Notice of Allowance. The
applicant then has six months (extendable for a total of three years) to file a
Statement of Use showing that it is making use of the mark in commerce. <i>See</i>
Lanham Act � 2(d), 15 U.S.C. � 1052(d). See also TMEP � 1106.</p>

Maintenance of the Registration</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term of registration is ten years. Lanham Act � 8, 15
U.S.C. �� 1058. The registration may be renewed indefinitely provided that the
registrant complies with the requirements of Lanham Act �� 8 &amp; 9, 15 U.S.C.
�� 1058 &amp; 1059. Section 8 requires the registrant to file an Affidavit of
Continuing Use during the sixth year and every tenth year following the date of
registration (thus, the registrant must file a �Section 8 affidavit� in the
sixth year, the tenth year, the twentieth year, the thirtieth year,
etc.).&nbsp; Section 9 requires the registrant to file a Renewal Application
every tenth year following the date of registration.<a href="#_ftn155"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[155]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; Registrants typically
file the Affidavit of Continuing Use and the Renewal Application as a single
document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Registrants are also strongly advised to file an Affidavit
of Incontestability under Lanham Act � 15 (15 U.S.C. � 1065) within one year
after any five-year period of continuous use of the mark. In practice,
sophisticated trademark owners typically combine their first � 8 Affidavit of
Continuing Use (filed in the sixth year following registration) with a � 15
Affidavit of Incontestability. A � 15 affidavit may be filed at any time during
the duration of the registration of the mark, however, provided that it is
filed within the year following five years� continuous use of the mark. See
TMEP � 1605.03.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392009986"><a name="_Toc366060805">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice
of Federal Registration</a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lanham Act � 29, 15 U.S.C. � 1111, provides:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 22 hereof [15 USC
1072], a registrant of a mark registered in the Patent Office, may give notice
that his mark is registered by displaying with the mark the words
&quot;Registered in U. S. Patent and Trademark Office&quot; or &quot;Reg. U.S.
Pat. &amp; Tm. Off.&quot; or the letter R enclosed within a circle, thus (R);
and in any suit for infringement under this Act by such a registrant failing to
give such notice of registration, no profits and no damages shall be recovered
under the provisions of this Act unless the defendant had actual notice of the
registration.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>.&nbsp; The latter part of � 29 is generally
understood to provide that in situations where the registrant has not provided
statutory notice of the registration of its mark, that registrant may only win
profits and damages from a period <i>after</i> the defendant had actual notice
of the registration status of the mark.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span

<p class=MsoNormal>The � or �r in a circle� designation indicates that the mark
is registered on either the Principal or Supplemental Register.&nbsp; A �TM� or
�SM� designation indicates that the mark is unregistered, but that the owner is
claiming property rights in the mark.&nbsp; Firms may sometimes use the �TM� or
�SM� designations in an attempt to educate consumers that the mark at issue is
a designation of source rather than simply a description, decoration, or
feature of the product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392009987"><a name="_Toc366060806">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Madrid System</a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The United States has been a member of the �Madrid System�
for the international registration of trademarks since November 2, 2003, which
was the effective date of the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act (�MPIA�), 116
Stat. 1758, 1913 Pub. L. 107-273.<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[157]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;
The Madrid System provides an efficient means by which trademark applicants or
registrants may apply to register their marks at multiple foreign trademark
offices through a single application filed at (and a single fee paid to) their
home trademark office.&nbsp; For example, a trademark applicant or registrant
at the PTO may file a single application and pay a single fee to register its
trademark at any or all of the 92 countries<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[158]</span></span></span></a>
within the Madrid Union; the fee increases with the number of countries.&nbsp;
The PTO will forward any such application to the International Bureau
administering the Madrid System (based in Geneva at the World Intellectual
Property Organization (�WIPO�)), which will then forward the application in
turn to all countries selected by the applicant.&nbsp; This can result in
significant cost savings for the applicant because it need not hire foreign
local counsel to prosecute its application unless the local trademark office
rejects or otherwise demands some response relating to the application.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the Madrid registrant need only file a single form and pay a
single fee to renew its mark across multiple foreign countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For U.S. applicants, there are certain drawbacks to using
Madrid.&nbsp; First, many foreign trademark offices permit relatively broad
definitions of the goods or services with which the mark will be used.&nbsp;
The PTO, however, does not.&nbsp; As a result, the U.S. applicant must file a narrow
definition of the applied-for mark�s goods in order to satisfy the PTO but will
then be required to use that definition when it seeks to extend its protection
abroad.&nbsp; For this reason, some U.S. applicants seek to file in foreign
countries locally rather than through Madrid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A second disadvantage of Madrid is that all international
trademark registrations filed through Madrid remain dependent on the
applicant�s home (or �basic�) registration for five years from the date of that
home registration.&nbsp; If the home registration fails during that five year
period (as a result of a �central attack� from a third party opposer or for any
other reason), then all international registrations will fail as well.&nbsp;
However, within three months from the date of the cancellation of its home
registration, the Madrid registrant may file to �transform� its international
registrations into local registrations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392009988"><a name="_Toc366060807">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancellation

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lanham Act � 14, 15 U.S.C. � 1064, address the circumstances
under which a third party may petition to cancel a registration.&nbsp; It
provides, in essence, that for the five year period following the date of
registration, a third party may petition to cancel the registration for any
reason. <i>See</i> Lanham Act � 14(1), 15 U.S.C. � 1064(1).&nbsp; After five
years has passed from the date of registration, a third party may petition to
cancel a registration for only a limited number of reasons expressly enumerated
in Lanham Act � 14(3), 15 U.S.C. � 1064(3).&nbsp; Here is the relevant
statutory language:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A petition to cancel a registration of a mark, stating the
grounds relied upon, may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, be filed as
follows by any person who believes that he is or will be damaged, including as
a result of a likelihood of dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment
under section 1125(c) of this title, by the registration of a mark on the
principal register established by this chapter, or under the Act of March 3,
1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) Within five years from the date of the registration of
the mark under this chapter.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) At any time if the registered mark becomes the generic

registered, or is functional, or has been abandoned, or its registration was
obtained fraudulently or contrary to the provisions of section 1054 of this
title or of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 1052 of this title for a
registration under this chapter, or contrary to similar prohibitory provisions
of such prior Acts for a registration under such Acts, or if the registered
mark is being used by, or with the permission of, the registrant so as to
misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in connection with which
the mark is used. If the registered mark becomes the generic name for less than
all of the goods or services for which it is registered, a petition to cancel
the registration for only those goods or services may be filed. A registered
mark shall not be deemed to be the generic name of goods or services solely
because such mark is also used as a name of or to identify a unique product or
service. The primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public
rather than purchaser motivation shall be the test for determining whether the
registered mark has become the generic name of goods or services on or in
connection with which it has been used.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Lanham Act � 14, 15 U.S.C. � 1064.&nbsp; Note what is

since the date of registration, a third party cannot petition to cancel the
registration on the ground that the mark is merely descriptive (this ground is
not included in � 14(3)) or on the ground that the registered mark is
confusingly similar with a previously used mark (�2(d) is not included in

even if the registrant has not applied for incontestable status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lanham Act � 37, 15 U.S.C. � 1119, provides federal courts
with broad powers over registrations:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In any action involving a registered mark the court may
determine the right to registration, order the cancelation of registrations, in
whole or in part, restore canceled registrations, and otherwise rectify the

appropriate entry upon the records of the Patent and Trademark Office, and
shall be controlled thereby.</p>

Registration Rates at the PTO</i>.&nbsp; The PTO�s recent release of data
concerning the registration process has made it possible to estimate the
overall trademark registration rate at the PTO, i.e., the proportion of
trademark applications that result in registration.&nbsp; For use-based
applications filed at the PTO from 1981 through 2007, the overall registration
rate was .75.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Barton Beebe, <i>Is the Trademark Office a
Rubber Stamp?</i>, 48 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Houston L. Rev</span>.
751, 762 (2011).&nbsp; For ITU-based applications filed from November 16, 1989
through 2007, the registration rate was .37.&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.&nbsp; What might
explain this significant difference in registration rates between use-based and
ITU-based applications?&nbsp; Consider the publication rates of such
applications, i.e., the proportion of applications that the PTO approved for
publication.&nbsp; For use-based applications filed at the PTO from 1981
through 2007, the publication rate was .76. <i>Id</i>. at 770. For ITU-based
applications filed from November 16, 1989 through 2007, the publication rate
was also .76. <i>Id</i>.&nbsp; Recall that after an ITU-based application is
approved for publication, the applicant must then submit a Statement of Use in
order to complete the registration process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The figure below shows trademark publication and registration
rates at the PTO over time.&nbsp; What might explain the pronounced dip in
registration rates in 1999-2000? </p>

rate for applications filed by attorneys was 82% while the publication rate for
applications filed by non-attorneys was 60%.&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 606.&nbsp; As

<p class=MsoNormal><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Trademark
Registrations as an Index of Innovation?</i>&nbsp; Recent scholarly work has
focused on the question of whether trademark registration data may be used to
measure the rate of �non-technological� innovation, specifically, innovation in
the service and marketing sectors (sectors about which patent data often has
very little to say). <i>See, e.g</i>., Valentine Millot, Trademarks as an
Indicator of Product and Marketing Innovations, OECD Science, Technology and
Industry Working Papers 2009/06 (2009), http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/224428874418.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Do State
Trademark Regsitrations Have Any Value?</i> In general, no they do not.&nbsp;
Scholars have even gone so far as to call for their abolition.&nbsp; <i>See</i>
Lee Ann W. Lockridge, <i>Abolishing State Trademark Registrations</i>, 29 <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Cardozo Arts &amp; Ent. L.J</span>. 597
(2011).&nbsp; Rockridge reports:</span></p>

<p class=Blockquote><span>Under the law of forty-five states, registrations
provide registrants with no significant, enforceable substantive rights beyond
those awarded under state common law or under the federal statute protecting
unregistered common law trademarks. In five states certain substantive rights
can accrue to an owner through state registration, although those rights are
limited by competing rights held by certain common law owners or federal
registrants.</span></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i><span>Id</span></i><span>. at 598-99.&nbsp;
Rockridge observes that in five states (</span>Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode
Island, Texas, and Washington), state law provides that a state trademark registration
will create constructive notice of the registrant�s claim of ownership as of
the date of state registration, which impairs the ability of a common law
adopter of the mark to claim good faith adoption of the mark after that date
(or good faith geographic expansion within the state of its prior continuing
use).&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 624.&nbsp; This benefit arises only under state law,
however, and has no bearing on claims brought under federal law.&nbsp; <i>Id</i>.&nbsp;
In the face of a subsequent third party federal registration, a state trademark
registrant is treated no better than a Section 7(c) prior �common law� user and
will be restricted to the geographic extent of its actual use of the mark
within the state as of the date of the federal application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McCarthy proposes one way in which state registration may provide
a slight advantage in federal litigation:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>State registrations in most states have little legal
significance other than serving as proof that on a certain date the registrant
filed a claim that it was using a certain mark. This gives a slight procedural
advantage of proving priority compared to merely relying upon a trademark
owner's inherent common-law right of priority as proven by business records.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
at � 22:1 (footnote omitted).&nbsp; Note, however, that before the TTAB, state
trademark registrations are not competent evidence of use by the state
registrant of the mark. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Visa International Service Ass'n
v. Visa Realtors</i>, 208 U.S.P.Q. 462 (TTAB 1980).</p>

state trademark law and federal trademark law, see Mark P. McKenna, <i>Trademark
Law�s Faux Federalism</i>, <i>in</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Intellectual
Property and the Common Law</span> 288 (Shyamkrishna Balganesh ed. 2013).&nbsp;
McKenna argues that �the persistent sense that federal and state law regulate
concurrently has masked a significant federalization of trademark and unfair
competition law over the last forty to fifty years.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at

<h2><a name="_Toc392009989">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Territorial Extent of Trademark Rights</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We consider in this section the geographical extent of
rights in unregistered and registered marks.&nbsp; We begin first with
unregistered (or �common law�) marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392009990"><a name="_Toc367712630">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Territorial Extent of Rights in Unregistered Marks</a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A classic hypothetical in U.S. trademark law involves the
question of whether the owner of an unregistered mark used in, say, Anchorage,
Alaska, can assert exclusive rights in that mark beyond the borders of Anchorage.&nbsp;
Can the proprietor of the unregistered mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>arctic</span>
for a coffee shop in Anchorage, Alaska prevent someone in Miami, Florida from
later opening a coffee shop under the same name?&nbsp; And should it make a
difference if the proprietor of the Miami coffee shop knew of the Anchorage
coffee shop when it opened its shop in Miami?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the landmark case of <i>United Drug Co. v. Theodore
Rectanus</i>, 248 U.S. 90 (1918), the Supreme Court confronted a set of facts
along these lines.&nbsp; The <i>Rectanus</i> case still guides how courts
determine the territorial scope of rights in unregistered marks.&nbsp; The
so-called �<i>Tea Rose-Rectanus</i> rule� (based on the <i>Rectanus</i> case
and <i>Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf</i>, 240 U.S. 403 (1916), commonly
known as the <i>Tea Rose</i> case) holds that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) The territorial scope of an unregistered mark is
limited to the territory in which the mark is known and recognized by those in
the defined group of potential customers.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) The national senior user of an unregistered mark cannot
stop the use of a territorially �remote� good faith national junior user who
was first to use the mark in that �remote� territory.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> �
26.2.&nbsp; The result of the <i>Tea Rose-Rectanus </i>rule is that, for an
unregistered mark, the first person to adopt the mark in the U.S. (the senior
national user) and subsequent good faith remote junior users may end up
coexisting in the national marketplace, with each entity claiming exclusive
rights in the mark in the geographic area in which it was the first to use the
mark.&nbsp; Thus, the Anchorage and Miami coffee shops may coexist, provided
that Miami adopted its mark in good faith (the standard for which we will
consider in a moment).&nbsp; Furthermore, barring federal registration by
either Anchorage or Miami, the two firms� exclusive rights will expand across
the country only in those areas in which each firm is the first to use the
mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you read through the <i>Rectanus</i> opinion, consider
the following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>What standard of good faith does the Court apply?&nbsp; Can a
geographically remote junior user adopt the mark in good faith if it has any
knowledge of the senior user�s use?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> This
was a suit in equity brought September 24, 1912, in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Kentucky by the present petitioner, a
Massachusetts corporation, against the respondent, a Kentucky corporation,
together with certain individual citizens of the latter state, to restrain
infringement of trade&#8209;mark and unfair competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The District Court granted an injunction against
the corporation defendant pursuant to the prayer of the bill. 206 Fed. 570. The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree and remanded the cause with
directions to dismiss the bill. 226 Fed. 545. An appeal was allowed by one of
the judges of that court, and afterwards we allowed a writ of certiorari�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The essential facts are as follows: About the year
1877 Ellen M. Regis, a resident of Haverhill, Mass., began to compound and
distribute in a small way a preparation for medicinal use in cases of dyspepsia
and some other ailments, to which she applied as a distinguishing name the word
'Rex'&#8212;derived from her surname. The word was put upon the boxes and
packages in which the medicine was placed upon the market, after the usual
manner of a trade&#8209;mark. At first alone, and afterwards in partnership
with her son under the firm name of 'E. M. Regis &amp; Co.,' she continued the
business on a modest scale; in 1898 she recorded the word 'Rex' as a trade&#8209;mark
under the laws of Massachusetts; in 1900 the firm procured its registration in
the United States Patent Office under the Act of March 3, 1881<a href="#_ftn159"
name="_ftnref159" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[159]</span></span></span></a>; in 1904 the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts sustained their trade&#8209;mark right under
the state law as against a concern that was selling medicinal preparations of
the present petitioner under the designation of 'Rexall Remedies'; afterwards
the firm established priority in the mark as against petitioner in a contested
proceeding in the Patent Office; and subsequently, in the year 1911, petitioner
purchased the business with the trade&#8209;mark right, and has carried it on
in connection with its other business, which consists in the manufacture of
medicinal preparations, and their distribution and sale through retail drug
stores, known as 'Rexall stores,' situate[d] in the different states of the
Union, four of them being in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Meanwhile,
about the year 1883, Theodore Rectanus, a druggist in Louisville, familiarly
known as 'Rex,' employed this word as a trade&#8209;mark for a medicinal
preparation known as a 'blood purifier.' He continued this use to a
considerable extent in Louisville<b> </b>and vicinity, spending money in
advertising and building up a trade, so that&#8212;except for whatever effect
might flow from Mrs. Regis' prior adoption of the word in Massachusetts, of
which he was entirely ignorant&#8212;he was entitled to use the word as his
trade&#8209;mark. In the year 1906 he sold his business, including the right to
the use of the word, to respondent; and the use of the mark by him and
afterwards by respondent was continuous from about the year 1883 until the
filing of the bill in the year 1912.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Petitioner's first use of the word 'Rex' in
connection with the sale of drugs in Louisville or vicinity was in April, 1912,
when two shipments of 'Rex Dyspepsia Tablets,' aggregating 150 boxes and valued
at $22.50, were sent to one of the 'Rexall' stores in that city. Shortly after
this the remedy was mentioned by name in local newspaper advertisements
published by those stores. In the previous September, petitioner shipped a
trifling amount&#8212;5 boxes&#8212;to a drug store in Franklin, Ky.,
approximately 120 miles distant from Louisville. There is nothing to show that
before this any customer in or near Kentucky had heard of the Regis remedy,
with or without the description 'Rex,' or that this word ever possessed any
meaning to the purchasing public in that state, except as pointing to Rectanus
and the Rectanus Company and their 'blood purifier.' That it did and does
convey the latter meaning in Louisville and vicinity is proved without dispute.
Months before petitioner's first shipment of its remedy to Kentucky, petitioner
was distinctly notified (in June, 1911) by one of its Louisville distributors,
that respondent was using the word 'Rex' to designate its medicinal
preparations, and that such use had been commenced by Mr. Rectanus as much as
16 or 17 years before that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There was nothing to sustain the allegation of
unfair competition, aside from the question of trade&#8209;mark infringement.
As to this, both courts found, in substance, that the use of the same mark upon
different but somewhat<b> </b>related preparations was carried on by the
parties and their respective predecessors contemporaneously, but in widely
separated localities, during the period in question&#8212;between 25 and 30
years&#8212;in perfect good faith; neither side having any knowledge or notice
of what was being done by the other. The District Court held that, because the
adoption of the mark by Mrs. Regis antedated its adoption by Rectanus,
petitioner's right to the exclusive use of the word in connection with medicinal
preparations intended for dyspepsia and kindred diseases of the stomach and
digestive organs must be sustained, but without accounting for profits or
assessment of damages for unfair trade�. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that
in view of the fact that Rectanus had used the mark for a long period of years
in entire ignorance of Mrs. Regis' remedy or of her trade&#8209;mark, had
expended money in making his mark well known, and had established a
considerable though local business under it in Louisville and vicinity, while
on the other hand during the same long period Mrs. Regis had done nothing,
either by sales agencies or by advertising, to make her medicine or its mark
known outside of the New England States, saving sporadic sales in territory
adjacent to those states, and had made no effort whatever to extend the trade
to Kentucky, she and her successors were bound to know that, misled by their
silence and inaction, others might act, as Rectanus and his successors did act,
upon the assumption that the field was open, and therefore were estopped to ask
for an injunction against the continued use of the mark in Louisville and
vicinity by the Rectanus Company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The entire argument for the petitioner is summed up
in the contention that whenever the first user of a trade&#8209;mark has been
reasonably diligent in extending the<b> </b>territory of his trade, and as a
result of such extension has in good faith come into competition with a later
user of the same mark who in equal good faith has extended his trade locally
before invasion of his field by the first user, so that finally it comes to
pass that the rival traders are offering competitive merchandise in a common
market under the same trade&#8209;mark, the later user should be enjoined at
the suit of the prior adopter, even though the latter be the last to enter the
competitive field and the former have already established a trade there. Its
application to the case is based upon the hypothesis that the record shows that
Mrs. Regis and her firm, during the entire period of limited and local trade in
her medicine under the Rex mark, were making efforts to extend their trade so
far as they were able to do with the means at their disposal. There is little
in the record to support this hypothesis; but, waiving this, we will pass upon
the principal contention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The asserted doctrine is based upon the fundamental
error of supposing that a trade&#8209;mark right is a right in gross or at
large, like a statutory copyright or a patent for an invention, to either of
which, in truth, it has little or no analogy. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311;
McLean v. Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 254. There is no such thing as property in a
trade&#8209;mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or
trade in connection with which the mark is employed. The law of trade&#8209;marks
is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition; the<b> </b>right to a
particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption; its function is
simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to
protect his good will against the sale of another's product as his; and it is
not the subject of property except in connection with an existing business.
Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 412&#8209;414.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The owner of a trade&#8209;mark may not, like the
proprietor<b> o</b>f a patented invention, make a negative and merely
prohibitive use of it as a monopoly. See United States v. Bell Telephone Co.,
167 U. S. 224, 250; Bement v. National Harrow Co., 186 U. S. 70, 90; Paper Bag
Patent Case, 210 U. S. 405, 424.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In truth, a trade&#8209;mark confers no monopoly
whatever in a proper sense, but is merely a convenient means for facilitating
the protection of one's good&#8209;will in trade by placing a distinguishing
mark or symbol&#8212;a commercial signature&#8212;upon the merchandise or the
package in which it is sold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It results that the adoption of a trade&#8209;mark
does not, at least in the absence of some valid legislation enacted for the
purpose, project the right of protection in advance of the extension of the trade,
or operate as a claim of territorial rights over areas into which it thereafter
may be deemed desirable to extend the trade. And the expression, sometimes met
with, that a trade&#8209;mark right is not limited in its enjoyment by
territorial bounds, is true only in the sense that wherever the trade goes,
attended by the use of the mark, the right of the trader to be protected
against the sale by others of their wares in the place of his wares will be
sustained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Property in trade&#8209;marks and the right to
their exclusive use rest upon the laws of the several states, and depend upon
them for security and protection; the power of Congress to legislate on the
subject being only such as arises from the authority to regulate commerce with
foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes. Trade&#8209;Mark
Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 93.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Conceding everything that is claimed in behalf of
the petitioner, the entire business conducted by Mrs. Regis and her firm prior
to April, 1911, when petitioner acquired it, was confined to the New England
States, with inconsiderable sales in New York, New Jersey, Canada, and Nova
Scotia. There was nothing in all of this to give her<b> </b>any rights in
Kentucky, where the principles of the common law obtain�. [W]hether [respondent
had exclusive rights in the mark in Kentucky], or respondent now has them, is a
question not presented by the record; there being no prayer for an injunction
to restrain petitioner from using the mark in the competitive field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is not contended, nor is there ground for the
contention, that registration of the Regis trade&#8209;mark under either the
Massachusetts statute or the act of Congress, or both, had the effect of
enlarging the rights of Mrs. Regis or of petitioner beyond what they would be
under common&#8209;law principles. Manifestly the Massachusetts statute could
have no extraterritorial effect. And the Act of Congress of March 3, 1881,
applied only to commerce with foreign nations or the Indian tribes, with either
of which this case has nothing to do. Nor is there any provision making
registration equivalent to notice of rights claimed thereunder. The Act of
February 20, 1905, which took the place of the 1881 act, while extending
protection to trade&#8209;marks used in interstate commerce, does not enlarge<b>
t</b>he effect of previous registrations, unless renewed under the provisions
of its twelfth section, which has not been done in this case; hence we need not
consider whether anything in this act would aid the petitioner's case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Undoubtedly, the general rule is that, as between conflicting
claimants to the right to use the same mark, priority of appropriation
determines the question. See Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 323; McLean v.
Fleming, 96 U. S. 245, 251; Manufacturing Co. v. Trainer, 101 U. S. 51, 53;
Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, 150 U. S. 460, 463. But the reason is that
purchasers have come to understand the mark as indicating the origin of the
wares, so that its use by a second producer amounts to an attempt to sell his
goods as those of his competitor. The reason for the rule does not extend to a
case where the same trade&#8209;mark<b> </b>happens to be employed
simultaneously by two manufacturers in different markets separate and remote
from each other, so that the mark means one thing in one market, an entirely
different thing in another. It would be a perversion of the rule of priority to
give it such an application in our broadly extended country that an innocent
party who had in good faith employed a trade&#8209;mark in one state, and by
the use of it had built up a trade there, being the first appropriator in that
jurisdiction, might afterwards be prevented from using it, with consequent
injury to his trade and good will, at the instance of one who theretofore had
employed the same mark, but only in other and remote jurisdictions, upon the
ground that its first employment happened to antedate that of the first&#8209;mentioned
trader.</p>

prior use of a trade&#8209;mark in a foreign country did not entitle its owner
to claim exclusive trade&#8209;mark rights in the United States as against one
who in good faith had adopted a like trade&#8209;mark here prior to the entry
of the foreigner into this market. Richter<b> </b>v. Anchor Remedy Co. (C. C.)

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span

v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 415, where we said:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the ordinary case of parties competing under the same
mark in the same market, it is correct to say that prior appropriation settles
the question. But where two parties independently are employing the same mark
upon goods of the same class, but in separate markets wholly remote the one
from the other, the question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant,
unless at least it appear that the second adopter has selected the mark with
some design inimical to the interests of the first user, such as to take the
benefit of the reputation of his goods, to forestall the extension of his
trade, or the like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, as already remarked, there is no
suggestion of a sinister purpose on the part of Rectanus or the Rectanus
Company; hence the passage quoted correctly defines the status of the parties
prior to the time when they came into competition in the Kentucky market. And
it results, as a necessary inference from what we have said, that petitioner,
being the newcomer in that market, must enter it subject to whatever rights had
previously been acquired there in good faith by the Rectanus Company and its
predecessor. To hold otherwise&#8212;to require Rectanus to retire from the
field upon the entry of Mrs. Regis' successor&#8212;would be to establish the
right of the latter as a right in gross, and to extend it to territory wholly
remote from the furthest reach of the trade to which it was annexed, with the
effect not merely of depriving Rectanus of the benefit of the good will
resulting from his long&#8209;continued use of the mark in Louisville and
vicinity, and his substantial expenditures in building up his trade, but of
enabling petitioner to reap substantial benefit from the publicity that
Rectanus<b> </b>has thus given to the mark in that locality, and of confusing
if not misleading the public as to the origin of goods thereafter sold in
Louisville under the Rex mark, for, in that market, until petitioner entered
it, 'Rex' meant the Rectanus product, not that of Regis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here the essential facts are so closely parallel to
those that furnished the basis of decision in the Allen &amp; Wheeler Case,
reported sub nom. Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 419&#8209;420,
39 Sup. Ct. 357, 60 L. Ed. 713, as to render further discussion unnecessary.
Mrs. Regis and her firm, having during a long period of years confined their
use of the 'Rex' mark to a limited territory wholly remote from that in
controversy, must be held to have taken the risk that some innocent party might
in the meantime hit upon the same mark, apply it to goods of similar character,
and expend money and effort in building up a trade under it; and since it
appears that Rectanus in good faith, and without notice of any prior use by
others, selected and used the 'Rex' mark, and by the expenditure of money and
effort succeeded in building up a local but valuable trade under it in
Louisville and vicinity before petitioner entered that field, so that 'Rex' had
come to be recognized there as the 'trade signature' of Rectanus and of
respondent as his successor, petitioner is estopped to set up their continued
use of the mark in that territory as an infringement of the Regis trade&#8209;mark.
Whatever confusion may have<b> </b>arisen from conflicting use of the mark is
attributable to petitioner's entry into the field with notice of the situation;
and petitioner cannot complain of this. As already stated, respondent is not
complaining of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Comments and
Questions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>How remote is a
remote location?</i>&nbsp; Remoteness is defined not by geographical distance
but by whether, at the moment when the junior user first adopts the mark,
consumers in the junior user�s area of use would likely have knowledge of the
senior user�s use such that confusion would result.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> � 26.4.&nbsp; Courts typically
apply a �market penetration� test to determine if the senior user has expanded
into the junior user�s area by the time the junior user adopts the mark.&nbsp; <i>See,
e.g</i>., <i>Natural Footwear Ltd. v. Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx</i>, 760 F.2d
1383 (3d Cir. 1985) (�[T]he following four factors should be considered to
determine whether the market penetration of a trademark in an area is
sufficient to warrant protection: (1) the volume of sales of the trademarked
product; (2) the growth trends (both positive and negative) in the area; (3)
the number of persons actually purchasing the product in relation to the
potential number of customers; and (4) the amount of product advertising in the
area.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Does knowledge
negate good faith?</i>&nbsp; All courts agree that if the junior user of the
unregistered mark had no knowledge at the time of adoption of the senior user�s
use, then the junior user adopted the mark in good faith.&nbsp; But what if the
junior user did have knowledge of the senior user�s use? Courts remain divided
on this question.&nbsp; In what the McCarthy treatise calls the �majority�
rule, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> � 26.9, some courts
appear to insist that any knowledge by junior of senior�s use destroys junior�s
good faith.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Money Store v. Harriscorp Finance, Inc</i>.,
689 F.2d 666, 674 (7th Cir. 1982) (�A good faith junior user is one who begins
using a mark with no knowledge that someone else is already using it.�).&nbsp;
In an emerging �minority� rule, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
� 26.10, other courts have held that mere knowledge, without more, will not
negate good faith.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>GTE Corp. v. Williams</i>, 904
F.2d 536 (10th Cir.1990) (�While a subsequent user's adoption of a mark with
knowledge of another's use can certainly support an inference of bad faith, ...
mere knowledge should not foreclose further inquiry. The ultimate focus is on
whether the second user has the intent to benefit from the reputation or
goodwill of the first user.�); <i>ACCU Personnel, Inc. v. AccuStaff, Inc</i>.,
846 F. Supp. 1191, 1211 (D. Del. 1994) (�[T]he Court holds a junior user's
prior knowledge of a senior user's trademark use is probative of, but not
dispositive of, the question whether the junior user acted in bad faith.�); <i>Architemps,
Inc. v. Architemps, Ltd</i>., 11 U.S.P.Q.2d 1885, 1989 WL 80300 (S.D. N.Y.
1989) (citing <i>815 Tonawanda Street Corp. v. Fay's Drug Co., Inc</i>., 842
F.2d 643, 650 (2d Cir.1988), as holding that mere knowledge of the existence of
the prior user does not, by itself, constitute bad faith).&nbsp; And at least
one court has adopted both views in the alternative.&nbsp; <i>See Tuccillo v.
Geisha NYC, LLC</i>, 635 F. Supp. 2d 227, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding that the
junior user of mark had knowledge of senior�s use and thus adopted in bad
faith, but also �alternatively find[ing] that [junior] had �bad faith� under
the minority rule because his behavior indicated an intent to squat on the
mark, and to take advantage of [senior]'s failure to obtain a prompt
registration of the JAPONAIS mark to capitalize on the goodwill built by Geisha
in connection with its mark.�)&nbsp; Which rule makes more sense?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The geographic
scope of rights in non-inherently distinctive marks</i>.&nbsp; If the senior
user�s unregistered mark is a non-inherently distinctive mark with secondary
meaning, then the geographic scope of the senior�s rights are limited to the
area in which the mark possesses secondary meaning.&nbsp; A junior user will be
enjoined from using the mark only if the senior user had established secondary
meaning in the junior user�s area of use by the time the junior user first
adopted the mark.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Katz Drug Co. v. Katz</i>, 188
F.2d 696 (8th Cir. 1951).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 (TLRA) created Lanham
Act � 7(c), 15 U.S.C. � 1057(c), which applies to all applications filed on or
after the November 16, 1989 effective date of the TLRA.<a href="#_ftn160"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[160]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; Section 7(c) reads as
follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(c) <i>Application to register mark considered constructive
use</i>. Contingent on the registration of a mark on the principal register
provided by this Act, the filing of the application to register such mark shall
constitute constructive use of the mark, conferring a right of priority,
nationwide in effect, on or in connection with the goods or services specified
in the registration against any other person except for a person whose mark has
not been abandoned and who, prior to such filing&#8211;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(1) has used the mark;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(2) has filed an application to
register the mark which is pending or has resulted in registration of the mark;
or</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(3) has filed a foreign
application to register the mark on the basis of which he or she has acquired a
right of priority, and timely files an application under section 44(d) [15 USC
1126(d)] to register the mark which is pending or has resulted in registration
of the mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>.&nbsp; Section 7(c) thus confers on the
successful registrant nationwide �constructive use� priority in the registered
mark as of the date of application, and does so regardless of whether the
registrant has in fact made or is in fact making actual nationwide use of the
mark.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>Humanoids Group v. Rogan</i>, 375 F.3d 301, 305 n.3
(4th Cir. 2004) (�Constructive use establishes a priority date with the same
legal effect as the earliest actual use of a trademark at common law.�
(citation omitted)).&nbsp; Note that until the registration issues, this
priority is merely �contingent� nationwide priority.&nbsp; The applicant may
not use � 7(c) to enjoin others� conduct until the registration issues, at
which time the registrants� constructive use priority is the date of
application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To appreciate the practical significance of � 7(c), imagine
the following course of events:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-42.3pt'>Time 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
files a � 1(b) intent-to-use application for registration of the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-42.3pt'>Time 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B
subsequently begins to make actual use of the mark throughout the U.S.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-42.3pt'>Time 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
begins to make actual use of the mark throughout the U.S. and files a Statement
of Use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-42.3pt'>Time 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A�s
application matures into registration.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Under the terms of � 7(c), registration confers on A
nationwide priority as of Time 1 even though A did not make actual use of the
mark until Time 3.&nbsp; At Time 4, A may enjoin B�s use.&nbsp; Meanwhile, even
though B was the first to make actual use of the mark, it cannot on that basis
enjoin A from completing the ITU process by making its own actual
use.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>See WarnerVision Entertainment Inc. v. Empire of Carolina
Inc</i>., 101 F.3d 259, 262 (2d Cir. 1996) (�The ITU provisions permit the
holder of an ITU application to use the mark in commerce, obtain registration,
and thereby secure priority retroactive to the date of filing of the ITU
application. Of course, this right or privilege is not indefinite; it endures
only for the time allotted by the statute. But as long as an ITU applicant's
privilege has not expired, a court may not enjoin it from making the use
necessary for registration on the grounds that another party has used the mark
subsequent to the filing of the ITU application. To permit such an injunction
would eviscerate the ITU provisions and defeat their very purpose.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the statutory language makes clear, � 7(c) nationwide
constructive use priority is subject to certain important exceptions.&nbsp;
Most significantly, the registrant cannot assert priority over any person who
began use of the mark prior to the registrant�s date of application.&nbsp; This
prior �common law� or unregistered user may continue to use its mark in the
area in which it was using it as of the registrant�s date of application.&nbsp;
One statutory basis for this rule&#8212;that the pre-application user is frozen
to its area of use as of the date of application&#8212;is � 33(b)(5), 15 U.S.C.
� 1115(b)(5), which establishes a so-called �intermediate junior user� defense
against either a contestable or incontestable registration.&nbsp; Section
33(b)(5) provides that the registrant�s rights are subject to the defense</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(5) That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an
infringement was adopted without knowledge of the registrant's prior use and
has been continuously used by such party or those in privity with him from a
date prior to (A) the date of constructive use of the mark established pursuant
to section 7(c) [15 USC 1057(c)], (B) the registration of the mark under this
Act if the application for registration is filed before the effective date of
the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, or (C) publication of the registered
mark under subsection (c) of section 12 of this Act [15 USC 1062(c)]: Provided,
however, That this defense or defect shall apply only for the area in which
such continuous prior use is proved.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1115(b)(5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The practical significance of � 33(b)(5) may be demonstrated
with the following set of facts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A begins actual use of the
mark in Area A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B begins actual use of the
mark in Area B.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A applies to register the
mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A�s registration issues.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>In this set of facts, A is the senior national user and
B is the junior national user who began its use at a time �intermediate�
between A�s first use and A�s application to register.&nbsp; From Time 4, A may
enjoin B�s use anywhere in the U.S. except in Area B (provided that B adopted
the mark without knowledge of A�s use).&nbsp; If B has been expanding its use
between Time 2 and Time 4, it will be allowed to continue to use its mark in
its area of actual use as of Time 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about situations in which the non-registrant is the
senior national user?&nbsp; Thus:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A begins actual use of the
mark in Area A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B begins actual use of the
mark in Area B.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>B</u> applies to register
the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>B</u>�s registration
issues.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Here, � 33(b)(5) does not apply because A is not the
intermediate junior user.&nbsp; Instead, it is the senior user.&nbsp; There is
some uncertainty over whether registrant B may limit A�s use to its area of
expansion as of B�s date of application or B�s date of registration.&nbsp;
McCarthy endorses the view that B may only limit A�s area of expansion as of
the latter date, B�s date of registration, because this was the view of the
Trademark Review Commission in 1988.&nbsp; <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
� 26:40.&nbsp; It is not clear, however, why � 7(c) nationwide constructive
use, to the extent that it is equivalent to actual nationwide common law use,
would not freeze the non-registrant as of the date of application.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>This �constructive notice� disables any person who

it did so in good faith. <i>See</i>&nbsp; <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>

<p class=Blockquote>(d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a

<h4><a name="_Toc392009996"><a name="_Toc367712635">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
<i>Dawn Donut</i> Rule</a></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart's Food Stores, Inc</i>., 267
F.2d 358 (2d Cir. 1959), the Second Circuit established a significant
geographic limitation on a federal registrant�s ability to enjoin
confusingly-similar uses by those over whom the registrant has priority.&nbsp;
The <i>Dawn Donut</i> court held that though registration confers on the
registrant nationwide priority, mere registration without more does not entitle
the registrant to nationwide injunctive relief.&nbsp; Instead, the registrant
must show that it is likely to make (or is already making) an actual use of the
mark in a post-registration junior user�s area of trade before the registrant
will be entitled to enjoin that use.&nbsp; The <i>Dawn Donut</i> rule does not
present a problem for a registrant making nationwide use of its mark.&nbsp; But
for a registrant making only a local or regional use of its mark, the
registrant cannot enjoin uses in different geographic areas until it can show
that it is likely to use or is actually using its mark in those areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the <i>Dawn Donut</i> case itself, the plaintiff was the
senior user and registrant of the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>dawn</span>
for doughnuts, which it had registered in 1927 and renewed under the Lanham Act
in 1947.&nbsp; In 1951, the defendant began to use the same mark for doughnuts
in Rochester, New York.&nbsp; At the time of the suit, the plaintiff was not
using its mark in the Rochester area.&nbsp; The Second Circuit held that if the
plaintiff was not making actual use of its mark in the Rochester area, then the
defendant�s use of the mark would not create a likelihood of confusion that
could form the basis of injunctive relief:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[I]f the use of the marks by the registrant and the
unauthorized user are confined to geographically separate markets, with no
likelihood that the registrant will expand his use into the defendant's market,
so that no public confusion is possible, then the registrant is not entitled to
enjoin the junior user's use of the mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Dawn Donut</i>, 267 F. 2d at 364.&nbsp; The
plaintiff could seek relief at a later date if it could show an intent to
expand into the defendant�s area of use:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[B]ecause of the effect we have attributed to the
constructive notice provision of the Lanham Act, the plaintiff may later, upon
a proper showing of an intent to use the mark at the retail level in
defendant's market area, be entitled to enjoin defendant's use of the mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 365.&nbsp; The strange effect of the <i>Dawn
Donut</i> rule is that the defendant would have to stop its use of the mark and
yield to the plaintiff at some point in the future when the plaintiff could
show expansion into defendant�s area of trade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Dawn Donut</i> remains good law.&nbsp; In the remarkable
case of <i>What-A-Burger Of Virginia, Inc. v. Whataburger, Inc. Of Corpus
Christi, Texas</i>, 357 F.3d 441 (4th Cir. 2004), the declaratory defendant
Whataburger-Texas registered the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>whataburger</span>
for restaurant services in September, 1957.&nbsp; By the time of the suit, Whataburger-Texas
was using the mark in connection with over 500 locations in various southern
states but not in Virginia.&nbsp; The declaratory plaintiff
What-a-burger-Virginia began to use the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>what-a-burger</span>
in Newport News, Virginia in August, 1957, and subsequently expanded its use to
various other locations in Virginia in the following years.&nbsp; In 1970, Whataburger-Texas
became aware of What-a-burger-Virginia�s use in Virginia and proposed a
licensing arrangement.&nbsp; There was no further communication between the
parties until 2002, when Whataburger-Texas contacted What-a-burger-Virginia to
determine if What-a-burger-Virginia�s use was infringing on Whataburger-Texas�s
registered mark. What-a-burger-Virginia asserted, among other things, that Whataburger-Texas
was barred by the doctrine of laches from asserting infringement because it had
waited nearly thirty years to do so.&nbsp; Whataburger-Texas successfully
argued that laches could not apply because, under the principles established in
<i>Dawn Donut</i>, Whataburger-Texas could not have sought during that thirty
year period to enjoin What-a-burger-Virginia�s use of the mark in
Virginia.&nbsp; The Fourth Circuit explained: �There is nothing in this case to
indicate a likelihood of entry into the local Virginia market by [Whataburger-Texas]
(in fact, [Whataburger-Texas] specifically disavows any such intention) or that
the likelihood of confusion otherwise looms large, triggering the obligation
for [Whataburger-Texas] to initiate an action for trademark infringement.�&nbsp;
<i>Id</i>. at 451.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least one judge, however, has criticized the <i>Dawn
Donut</i> rule as obsolete:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The <i>Dawn Donut</i> Rule was enunciated in 1959. Entering
the new millennium, our society is far more mobile than it was four decades
ago. For this reason, and given that recent technological innovations such as
the Internet are increasingly deconstructing geographical barriers for
marketing purposes, it appears to me that a re-examination of precedents would
be timely to determine whether the Dawn Donut Rule has outlived its usefulness.</p>

title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[162]</span></span></span></a>
for the mark �PERSON'S� for wearing apparel on the following grounds:
likelihood of confusion based on its prior foreign use, abandonment, and unfair
competition within the meaning of the Paris Convention. We affirm the Board's
decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>Background</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows:
In 1977, Takaya Iwasaki first applied a stylized logo bearing the name
�PERSON'S� to clothing in his native Japan. Two years later Iwasaki formed
Person's Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation, to market and distribute the
clothing items in retail stores located in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1981, Larry Christman, a U.S. citizen and
employee of a sportswear wholesaler, visited a Person's Co. retail store while
on a business trip to Japan. Christman purchased several clothing items bearing
the �PERSON'S� logo and returned with them to the United States. After
consulting with legal counsel and being advised that no one had yet established
a claim to the logo in the United States, Christman developed designs for his
own �PERSON'S� brand sportswear line based on appellant's products he had
purchased in Japan. In February 1982, Christman contracted with a clothing
manufacturer to produce clothing articles with the �PERSON'S� logo attached.
These clothing items were sold, beginning in April 1982, to sportswear
retailers in the northwestern United States. Christman formed Team Concepts,
Ltd., a Washington corporation, in May 1983 to continue merchandising his
sportswear line, which had expanded to include additional articles such as
shoulder bags. All the sportswear marketed by Team Concepts bore either the
mark �PERSON'S� or a copy of appellant's globe logo; many of the clothing
styles were apparently copied directly from appellant's designs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In April 1983, Christman filed an application for
U.S. trademark registration in an effort to protect the �PERSON'S� mark.
Christman believed himself to be the exclusive owner of the right to use and
register the mark in the United States and apparently had no knowledge that
appellant soon intended to introduce its similar sportswear line under the
identical mark in the U.S. market. Christman's registration issued in September
1984 for use on wearing apparel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the interim between Christman's first sale and
the issuance of his registration, Person's Co., Ltd. became a well known and
highly respected force in the Japanese fashion industry. The company, which had
previously sold garments under the �PERSON'S� mark only in Japan, began
implementing its plan to sell goods under this mark in the United States.
According to Mr. Iwasaki, purchases by buyers for resale in the United States
occurred as early as November 1982. This was some seven months subsequent to
Christman's first sales in the United States. Person's Co. filed an application
for U.S. trademark registration in the following year, and, in 1985, engaged an
export trading company to introduce its goods into the U.S. market. The
registration for the mark �PERSON'S� issued in August 1985 for use on luggage,
clothing and accessories. After recording U.S. sales near 4 million dollars in
1985, Person's Co. granted California distributor Zip Zone International a
license to manufacture and sell goods under the �PERSON'S� mark in the United
States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In early 1986, appellant's advertising in the U.S.
became known to Christman and both parties became aware of confusion in the
marketplace. Person's Co. initiated an action to cancel Christman's
registration on the following grounds: (1) likelihood of confusion; (2)
abandonment; and (3) unfair competition within the meaning of the Paris
Convention. Christman counterclaimed and asserted prior use and likelihood of
confusion as grounds for cancellation of the Person's Co. registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After some discovery, Christman filed a motion with
the Board for summary judgment on all counts. In a well reasoned decision, the
Board held for Christman on the grounds that Person's use of the mark in Japan
could not be used to establish priority against a �good faith� senior user in
U.S. commerce. The Board found no evidence to suggest that the �PERSON'S� mark
had acquired any notoriety in this country at the time of its adoption by
Christman. Therefore, appellant had no reputation or goodwill upon which
Christman could have intended to trade, rendering the unfair competition
provisions of the Paris Convention inapplicable. The Board also found that
Christman had not abandoned the mark, although sales of articles bearing the
mark were often intermittent. The Board granted summary judgment to Christman
and ordered appellant's registration cancelled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Board held in its opinion on reconsideration
that Christman had not adopted the mark in bad faith despite his appropriation
of a mark in use by appellant in a foreign country. The Board adopted the view
that copying a mark in use in a foreign country is not in bad faith unless the
foreign mark is famous in the United States or the copying is undertaken for
the purpose of interfering with the prior user's planned expansion into the
United States. Person's Co. appeals and requests that this court direct the
Board to enter summary judgment in its favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>Issues</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> 1. Does knowledge of a mark's use outside U.S.
commerce preclude good faith adoption and use of the identical mark in the
United States prior to the entry of the foreign user into the domestic market?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> 2. Did the Board properly grant summary judgment in
favor of Christman on the issue of abandonment?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>Cancellation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Board may properly cancel a trademark
registration within five years of issue when, e.g. (1) there is a valid ground
why the trademark should not continue to be registered and (2) the party petitioning
for cancellation has standing. Such cancellation of the marks' registrations
may be based upon any ground which could have prevented registration initially.
&nbsp;The legal issue in a cancellation proceeding is the right to register a
mark, which may be based on either (1) ownership of a foreign registration of
the mark in question or (2) use of the mark in United States commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>Priority</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first ground asserted for cancellation in the present
action is � 2(d) of the Lanham Act; each party claims prior use of registered
marks which unquestionably are confusingly similar and affixed to similar
goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Section 1 of the Lanham Act<a href="#_ftn163"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[163]</span></span></span></a> states that �[t]he owner of
a trademark <i>used in commerce</i> may register his trademark....� The term
�commerce� is defined in Section 45 of the Act as �.... all commerce which may
be lawfully regulated by Congress.� No specific Constitutional language gives Congress
power to regulate trademarks, so the power of the federal government to provide
for trademark registration comes only under its commerce power. The term �used
in commerce� in the Lanham Act refers to a sale or transportation of goods
bearing the mark in or having an effect on: (1) United States interstate
commerce; (2) United States commerce with foreign nations; or (3) United States
commerce with the Indian Tribes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the present case, appellant Person's Co. relies
on its use of the mark in Japan in an attempt to support its claim for priority
in the United States. Such foreign use has no effect on U.S. commerce and
cannot form the basis for a holding that appellant has priority here. The concept
of territoriality is basic to trademark law; trademark rights exist in each
country solely according to that country's statutory scheme. Christman was the
first to use the mark in United States commerce and the first to obtain a
federal registration thereon. Appellant has no basis upon which to claim
priority and is the junior user under these facts.<a href="#_ftn164"
name="_ftnref164" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0in'><i>Bad
Faith</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellant vigorously asserts that Christman's
adoption and use of the mark in the United States subsequent to Person's Co.'s
adoption in Japan is tainted with �bad faith� and that the priority in the
United States obtained thereby is insufficient to establish rights superior to
those arising from Person's Co.'s prior adoption in a foreign country. Relying
on <i>Woman's World Shops, Inc. v. Lane Bryant, Inc.,</i> 5 USPQ2d 1985 (TTAB
1988), Person's Co. argues that a �remote junior user� of a mark obtains no
right superior to the �senior user� if the �junior user� has adopted the mark
with knowledge of the �senior user's� prior use.<a href="#_ftn165"
name="_ftnref165" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[165]</span></span></span></a> In <i>Woman's World,</i>
the senior user utilized the mark within a limited geographical area. A junior
user from a different geographical area of the United States sought
unrestricted federal registration for a nearly identical mark, with the
exception to its virtually exclusive rights being those of the known senior
user. The Board held that such an appropriation with knowledge failed to
satisfy the good faith requirements of the Lanham Act and denied the concurrent
use rights sought by the junior user. 5 USPQ2d at 1988.&nbsp; Person's Co.
cites <i>Woman's World</i> for the proposition that a junior user's adoption
and use of a mark with knowledge of another's prior use constitutes bad faith.
It is urged that this principle is equitable in nature and should not be
limited to knowledge of use within the territory of the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While the facts of the present case are analogous
to those in <i>Woman's World,</i> the case is distinguishable in one
significant respect. In <i>Woman's World,</i> the first use of the mark by both
the junior and senior users was in United States commerce. In the case at bar,
appellant Person's Co., while first to adopt the mark, was not the first user
in the United States. Christman is the senior user, and we are aware of no case
where a senior user has been charged with bad faith. The concept of bad faith
adoption applies to remote junior users seeking concurrent use registrations;
in such cases, the likelihood of customer confusion in the remote area may be
presumed from proof of the junior user's knowledge.<a href="#_ftn166"
name="_ftnref166" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[166]</span></span></span></a> In the present case, when
Christman initiated use of the mark, Person's Co. had not yet entered U.S.
commerce. The Person's Co. had no goodwill in the United States and the
�PERSON'S� mark had no reputation here. Appellant's argument ignores the
territorial nature of trademark rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellant next asserts that Christman's knowledge
of its prior use of the mark in Japan should preclude his acquisition of
superior trademark rights in the United States. The Board found that, at the
time of registration, Christman was not aware of appellant's intention to enter
the U.S. clothing and accessories market in the future. Christman obtained a
trademark search on the �PERSON'S� mark and an opinion of competent counsel
that the mark was �available� in the United States. Since Appellant had taken
no steps to secure registration of the mark in the United States, Christman was
aware of no basis for Person's Co. to assert superior rights to use and
registration here. Appellant would have us infer bad faith adoption because of
Christman's awareness of its use of the mark in Japan, but an inference of bad
faith requires something more than mere knowledge of prior use of a similar
mark in a foreign country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the Board noted below, Christman's prior use in
U.S. commerce cannot be discounted solely because he was aware of appellant's
use of the mark in Japan. While adoption of a mark with knowledge of a prior
actual <i>user</i> in U.S. commerce may give rise to cognizable equities as
between the parties, no such equities may be based upon knowledge of a similar mark's
existence or on a problematical intent to use such a similar mark in the
future. Knowledge of a foreign use does not preclude good faith adoption and
use in the United States. While there is some case law supporting a finding of
bad faith where (1) the foreign mark is famous here<a href="#_ftn167"
name="_ftnref167" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[167]</span></span></span></a> or (2) the use is a nominal
one made solely to block the prior foreign user's planned expansion into the
United States,<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[168]</span></span></span></a>
as the Board correctly found, neither of these circumstances is present in this
case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the Board's conclusion that
Christman's adoption and use of the mark were in good faith. Christman's
adoption of the mark occurred at a time when appellant had not yet entered U.S.
commerce; therefore, no prior user was in place to give Christman notice of
appellant's potential U.S. rights. Christman's conduct in appropriating and
using appellant's mark in a market where he believed the Japanese manufacturer
did not compete can hardly be considered unscrupulous commercial conduct.
Christman adopted the trademark being used by appellant in Japan, but appellant
has not identified any aspect of U.S. trademark law violated by such action.
Trademark rights under the Lanham Act arise solely out of use of the mark in
U.S. commerce or from ownership of a foreign registration thereon; �[t]he law
pertaining to registration of trademarks does not regulate all aspects of
business morality.� [citation omitted] When the law has been crafted with the
clarity of crystal, it also has the qualities of a glass slipper: it cannot be
shoe-horned onto facts it does not fit, no matter how appealing they might
appear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0in'><i>Conclusion</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co.,</i> 248 U.S.
90 (1918), the Supreme Court of the United States determined that �[t]here is
no such thing as property in a trademark except as a right appurtenant to an
established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed....
[I]ts function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular
trader and to protect his goodwill against the sale of another's product as
his; and it is not the subject of property except in connection with an
existing business.�<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title=""><span

In the present case, appellant failed to secure protection for its mark through
use in U.S. commerce; therefore, no established business or product line was in
place from which trademark rights could arise. Christman was the first to use
the mark in U.S. commerce. This first use was not tainted with bad faith by
Christman's mere knowledge of appellant's prior foreign use, so the Board's
conclusion on the issue of priority was correct�. Accordingly, the grant of
summary judgment was entirely in order, and the Board's decision is affirmed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Territoriality
of Priority and the �Use in Commerce� Requirement</i>.&nbsp; How might a
foreign user of a mark avoid the outcome in <i>Person�s</i>?&nbsp; In other
words, what would Person�s have had to do to prevail over Christman?&nbsp;
Recall our consideration of the �use in commerce� requirement above in Part
I.C.&nbsp; If, prior to Christman�s use, Person�s had made sufficient use in
the U.S. to satisfy the �use in commerce� requirement, then Person�s would have
enjoyed priority over Christman.&nbsp; Recall also, however, our consideration
of the territorial limits of rights in unregistered marks.&nbsp; If Person�s
had made a use prior to Christman�s only in certain areas of the U.S. and
failed to apply for registration of its mark, then Christman could possibly
have claimed priority in those areas where Person�s had not yet made a
use.&nbsp; Indeed, in such a situation, Christman could apply for registration
and freeze Person�s to the limited areas in which Person�s was using the mark
as of the date of Christman�s application. Lanham Act � 7(c), 15 U.S.C. �
1057(c).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two significant cases have emerged out of the relation
between territorial priority and the use in commerce requirement, both in the
context of services.&nbsp; The first is <i>Buti v. Perosa, S.R.L</i>., 139 F.3d
98 (2d Cir. 1998). In 1987, the declaratory defendant opened <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>fashion cafe</span> in Milan, Italy and
promoted the restaurant in the U.S. with �literally thousands of t-shirts,
cards, and key chains with the�Fashion Cafe name and logo.� <i>Id</i>. at 100.&nbsp;
However, the defendant never opened a restaurant in the U.S.&nbsp; In 1993,
Buti opened <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>fashion cafe</span> in Miami
and subsequently announced plans to open franchises in several other U.S.

The declaratory plaintiffs operated various websites whose domain names and

its services only abroad.&nbsp; In a controversial opinion, the Fourth Circuit
found infringement.&nbsp; Judge Luttig reasoned, in short, that the defendant
had shown �use in commerce� because (1) U.S. consumers� purchase of casino

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>KLEINFELD, Circuit Judge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This is a trademark case. The contest is between a
large Mexican grocery chain that has long used the mark, but not in the United
States, and a small American chain that was the first to use the mark in the
United States, but did so, long after the Mexican chain began using it, in a
locality where shoppers were familiar with the Mexican mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>Facts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Grupo Gigante S.A. de C.V. (�Grupo Gigante�)
operates a large chain of grocery stores in Mexico, called �Gigante,� meaning
�Giant� in Spanish. Grupo Gigante first called a store �Gigante� in Mexico City
in 1962. In 1963, Grupo Gigante registered the �Gigante� mark as a trade name
in Mexico, and has kept its registration current ever since. The chain was
quite successful, and it had expanded into Baja California, Mexico by 1987. By
1991, Grupo Gigante had almost 100 stores in Mexico, including six in Baja, all
using the mark �Gigante.� Two of the Baja stores were in Tijuana, a city on the
U.S.-Mexican border, just south of San Diego.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As of August 1991, Grupo Gigante had not opened any
stores in the United States. That month, Michael Dallo began operating a
grocery store in San Diego, using the name �Gigante Market.� In October 1996,
Dallo and one of his brothers, Chris Dallo, opened a second store in San Diego,
also under the name Gigante Market. The Dallo brothers&#8212;who include Michael,
Chris, and their two other brothers, Douray and Rafid&#8212;have since
controlled the two stores through various limited liability corporations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1995, which was after the opening of the Dallos'
first store and before the opening of their second, Grupo Gigante began
exploring the possibility of expanding into Southern California. It learned of
the Dallos' Gigante Market in San Diego. Grupo Gigante decided against entering
the California market at that time. It did nothing about the Dallos' store
despite Grupo Gigante's knowledge that the Dallos were using �Gigante� in the
store's name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1998, Grupo Gigante decided that the time had
come to enter the Southern California market. It arranged a meeting with
Michael Dallo in June 1998 to discuss the Dallos' use of the name �Gigante.�
Grupo Gigante was unsuccessful at this meeting in its attempt to convince Dallo
to stop using the �Gigante� mark. Also in June 1998, Grupo Gigante registered
the �Gigante� mark with the state of California. The Dallos did likewise in
July 1998. Neither has registered the mark federally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> About one year later, in May 1999, Grupo Gigante
opened its first U.S. store. That store was followed by a second later that
year, and then by a third in 2000. All three stores were in the Los Angeles
area. All were called �Gigante,� like Grupo Gigante's Mexican stores.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In July 1999, after learning of the opening of
Grupo Gigante's first U.S. store, the Dallos sent Grupo Gigante a
cease-and-desist letter, making the same demand of Grupo Gigante that Grupo
Gigante had made of them earlier: stop using the name Gigante. Grupo Gigante
responded several days later by filing this lawsuit. Its claim was based on
numerous federal and state theories, including trademark infringement under the
Lanham Act.<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[170]</span></span></span></a>
It sought compensatory and punitive damages, a declaratory judgment that it had
the superior right to the Gigante mark, and an injunction against the Dallos'
use of the mark. The Dallos counterclaimed, on similar theories, asserting it
had the superior right to the mark in Southern California.<a href="#_ftn171"
name="_ftnref171" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[171]</span></span></span></a> The Dallos sought a
declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, damages, and cancellation of Grupo
Gigante's California registration of the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court disposed of the case in a
published decision on cross motions for summary judgment.<a href="#_ftn172"
name="_ftnref172" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[172]</span></span></span></a> The court recognized that
under the �territoriality principle,� use of a mark in another country
generally does not serve to give the user trademark rights in the United
States. Thus, the territoriality principle suggests that the Dallos' use of the
mark, which was the first in the United States, would entitle them to claim the
mark. But it held that because Grupo Gigante had already made Gigante a
well-known mark in Southern California by the time the Dallos began using it,
an exception to the territoriality principle applied. As the district court
interpreted what is known as the �famous-mark� or �well-known mark� exception
to the territoriality principle, Grupo Gigante's earlier use in Mexico was
sufficient to give it the superior claim to the mark in Southern California.
The court held, therefore, that Grupo Gigante was entitled to a declaratory
judgment that it had a valid, protectable interest in the Gigante name.
Nevertheless, the court held that laches barred Grupo Gigante from enjoining
the Dallos from using the mark at their two existing stores. The Dallos appeal
the holding that Grupo Gigante has a protectable right to use the mark in
Southern California. Grupo Gigante appeals the laches holding. We agree in
large part with the district court's excellent opinion, but some necessary
qualifications to it require a remand.</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>The exception for famous and well-known foreign marks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We review the summary judgment decision de novo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A fundamental principle of trademark law is first
in time equals first in right. But things get more complicated when to time we
add considerations of place, as when one user is first in time in one place
while another is first in time in a different place. The complexity swells when
the two places are two different countries, as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under the principle of first in time equals first
in right, priority ordinarily comes with earlier <i>use</i> of a mark in
commerce. It is �not enough to have invented the mark first or even to have
registered it first.� If the first-in-time principle were all that mattered,
this case would end there. It is undisputed that Grupo Gigante used the mark in
commerce for decades before the Dallos did. But the facts of this case
implicate another well-established principle of trademark law, the �territoriality
principle.� The territoriality principle, as stated in a treatise, says that
�[p]riority of trademark rights in the United States depends solely upon
priority of use in the United States, not on priority of use anywhere in the
world.�<a href="#_ftn173" name="_ftnref173" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[173]</span></span></span></a>
Earlier use in another country usually just does not count.<a href="#_ftn174"
name="_ftnref174" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[174]</span></span></span></a> Although we have not had
occasion to address this principle, it has been described by our sister
circuits as �basic to trademark law,� in large part because �trademark rights
exist in each country solely according to that country's statutory scheme.�<a
href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[175]</span></span></span></a> While Grupo Gigante used
the mark for decades before the Dallos used it, Grupo Gigante's use was in
Mexico, not in the United States. Within the San Diego area, on the northern
side of the border, the Dallos were the first users of the �Gigante� mark.
Thus, according to the territoriality principle, the Dallos' rights to use the
mark would trump Grupo Gigante's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Grupo Gigante does not contest the existence of the
territoriality principle. But like the first-in-time, first-in-right principle,
it is not absolute. The exception, as Grupo Gigante presents it, is that when
foreign use of a mark achieves a certain level of fame for that mark within the
United States, the territoriality principle no longer serves to deny priority
to the earlier foreign user. The Dallos concede that there is such an
exception, but dispute what it takes for a mark to qualify for it. Grupo
Gigante would interpret the exception<b> </b>broadly, while the Dallos would
interpret it narrowly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Grupo Gigante does not argue to this court that it
used the mark <i>in the United States</i> in a way that qualifies for
protection regardless of the territoriality principle and any exception to it.
While the district court opinion suggests that Grupo Gigante made an
alternative argument of this sort below, its argument on appeal is limited to
whether the mark has become well-known enough to overcome the territoriality
principle. For example, while the statement of facts in Grupo Gigante's brief
claims that Grupo Gigante engaged in advertising in Mexico that reached United
States consumers, Grupo Gigante does not assert that this advertising, combined
with other activities, constitutes domestic use of the mark.<a href="#_ftn176"
name="_ftnref176" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[176]</span></span></span></a> Thus, while Grupo Gigante
does not appear to concede explicitly that application of the famous-mark
exception is necessary to its success on appeal, the structure of its argument
suggests as much. Since the district court based its holding on an
interpretation of the exception, and since Grupo Gigante does not urge us to
consider alternative ways it might be eligible for protection, we have no
occasion to decide, and do not decide, whether Grupo Gigante could establish
protection for its mark apart from application of the famous-mark exception to
the territoriality principle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no circuit-court authority&#8212;from this
or any other circuit&#8212;applying a famous-mark exception to the
territoriality principle. At least one circuit judge has, in a dissent, called
into question whether there actually is any meaningful famous-mark exception.<a
href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[177]</span></span></span></a> We hold, however, that
there is a famous mark exception to the territoriality principle. While the
territoriality principle is a long-standing and important doctrine within
trademark law, it cannot be absolute. An absolute territoriality rule without a
famous-mark exception would promote consumer confusion and fraud. Commerce
crosses borders. In this nation of immigrants, so do people. Trademark is, at
its core, about protecting against consumer confusion and �palming off.�<a
href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[178]</span></span></span></a> There can be no
justification for using trademark law to fool immigrants into thinking that
they are buying from the store they liked back home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It might not matter if someone visiting Fairbanks,
Alaska from Wellington, New Zealand saw a cute hair-salon name&#8212;�Hair
Today, Gone Tomorrow,� �Mane Place,� �Hair on Earth,� �Mary's Hair'em,� or
�Shear Heaven�&#8212;and decided to use the name on her own salon back home in
New Zealand. The ladies in New Zealand would not likely think they were going
to a branch of a Fairbanks hair salon. But if someone opened a high-end salon
with a red door in Wellington and called it Elizabeth Arden's, women might very
well go there because they thought they were going to an affiliate of the
Elizabeth Arden chain, even if there had not been any other Elizabeth Ardens in
New Zealand prior to the salon's opening. If it was not an affiliate, just a
local store with no connection, customers would be fooled. The real Elizabeth
Arden chain might lose business if word spread that the Wellington salon was
nothing special.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The most cited case for the famous-mark exception
is <i>Vaudable v. Montmartre, Inc.,</i> a 1959 trial court decision from New
York.<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[179]</span></span></span></a>
A New York restaurant had opened under the name �Maxim's,� the same name as the
well-known Parisian restaurant in operation since 1893, and still in operation
today. The New York Maxim's used similar typography for its sign, as well as
other features likely to evoke the Paris Maxim's&#8212;particularly among what
the court called �the class of people residing in the cosmopolitan city of New
York who dine out�<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[180]</span></span></span></a>
(by which it apparently meant the sort of people who spend for dinner what some
people spend for a month's rent). The court enjoined the New York use, even
though the Paris restaurant did not operate in New York, or in the United
States, because the Maxim's mark was �famous.�<a href="#_ftn181"
name="_ftnref181" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While <i>Vaudable</i> stands for the principle that
even those who use marks in other countries can sometimes&#8212;when their
marks are famous enough&#8212;gain exclusive rights to the marks in this
country, the case itself tells us little about just how famous or well-known
the foreign mark must be. The opinion states in rather conclusory terms that
the Paris Maxim's �is, of course, well known in this country,� and that
�[t]here is <i>no doubt</i> as to its unique and eminent position as a
restaurant of international fame and prestige.�<a href="#_ftn182"
name="_ftnref182" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[182]</span></span></span></a> This language suggests that
Maxim's had achieved quite a high degree of fame here, and certainly enough to
qualify for the exception to the territoriality principle, but it suggests
nothing about just how much fame was necessary. It does not suggest where the
line is between �Shear Heaven� and Maxim's. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Patent and Trademark Office's Trademark Trial
and Appeal Board, whose expertise we respect and whose decisions create
expectations, has recognized the validity of the famous-mark exception.<a
href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[183]</span></span></span></a> But as with <i>Vaudable,</i>
none of these cases helps us to establish a clear threshold for just how famous
a mark must be to qualify for the exception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Grupo Gigante urges us to adopt the approach the
district court took. The district court held that the correct inquiry was to
determine whether the mark had attained secondary meaning in the San Diego
area. Secondary meaning refers to a mark's actual ability to trigger in
consumers' minds a link between a product or service and the source of that
product or service. That is, a mark has secondary meaning �when, in the minds
of the public, the primary significance of a mark is to identify the source of
the product rather than the product itself.�<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[184]</span></span></span></a>
Determining whether a mark has secondary meaning requires taking into account
at least seven considerations, which the district court did in this case.<a
href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[185]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying its interpretation of the famous-mark
exception, the district court concluded that Grupo Gigante's use of the mark
had achieved secondary meaning in the San Diego area by the time the Dallos
opened their first store, and thus the court held that Grupo Gigante's use was
eligible for the exception to the territoriality principle. Grupo Gigante
asserts that we, too, should adopt secondary meaning as the definition of the
exception. We decline to go quite this far, however, because following the
district court's lead would effectively cause the exception to eclipse the
territoriality rule entirely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Secondary meaning has two functions. First, it
serves to determine whether certain marks are distinctive enough to warrant
protection. Some marks&#8212;those that are arbitrary, fanciful, or
suggestive&#8212;are deemed inherently distinctive. Others&#8212;including
those that are descriptive of some feature of the products or services to which
they are attached&#8212;require some indication of distinctiveness before
trademark protection is available. That required indication is that the mark
have acquired secondary meaning. Thus, before Grupo Gigante (or for that matter
the Dallos) could have a protectable interest in �Gigante� at all, Grupo
Gigante would have to show that the mark has acquired secondary meaning by
demonstrating that it has come to identify to consumers Grupo Gigante's
particular brand of store, not merely a characteristic of Grupo Gigante's
stores and others like them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, and most relevant to this case, secondary
meaning defines the geographic area in which a user has priority, regardless of
who uses the mark first. Under what has become known as the <i>Tea
Rose&#8211;Rectanus</i> doctrine, priority of use in one geographic area within
the United States does not necessarily suffice to establish priority in another
area. Thus, the first user of a mark will not necessarily be able to stop a
subsequent user, where the subsequent user is in an area of the country
�remote� from the first user's area.<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[186]</span></span></span></a>
The practical effect is that one user may have priority in one area, while
another user has priority over the very same mark in a different area. The
point of this doctrine is that in the remote area, where no one is likely to
know of the earlier user, it is unlikely that consumers would be confused by
the second user's use of the mark. Secondary meaning comes into play in
determining just how far each user's priority extends. Courts ask whether the
first, geographically limited use of the mark is well-known enough that it has
gained secondary meaning not just within the area where it has been used, but
also within the remote area, which is usually the area where a subsequent user
is claiming the right to use the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Assume, for example, that Grupo Gigante had been
using the mark in Arizona as well as in various parts of Mexico, and that it
had met all the other requirements of having a protectable interest in the
mark, including having established secondary meaning throughout Arizona. If the
Dallos later began using the same mark in San Diego without knowledge of Grupo
Gigante's earlier �remote� use in Arizona, whether Grupo Gigante could stop
them would depend on what the mark meant to consumers in San Diego. Under the <i>Tea
Rose&#8211;Rectanus</i> doctrine, Grupo Gigante would have priority in San
Diego, and thus be able to stop the Dallos' use of the mark, only if the
secondary meaning from Grupo Gigante's use of the mark in Arizona extended to
San Diego as well. If, on the other hand, the secondary meaning from Grupo
Gigante's use were limited to Arizona, then the Dallos might be free to
continue using the mark in San Diego.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, if the dispute before us were between a
Mexican and Arizonan Grupo Gigante on the one hand, and the Dallos on the
other, we would analyze, under the <i>Tea Rose&#8211;Rectanus</i> doctrine,
whether Grupo Gigante's use of the mark had achieved secondary meaning in San
Diego. This is how the district court analyzed the actual dispute, as a result
of having defined the exception to the territoriality principle in terms of
secondary meaning. In other words, the district court treated Grupo Gigante's
use of the mark exactly as it would have had Grupo Gigante used the mark not
only in Mexico, but also in another part of the United States. Under the
district court's interpretation of the exception to the territoriality
principle, the fact that Grupo Gigante's earlier use of the mark was entirely
outside of the United States becomes irrelevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The problem with this is that treating
international use differently is what the territoriality principle does. This
interpretation of the exception would effectively eliminate the territoriality
principle by eliminating any effect of international borders on protectability.
We would end up treating foreign uses of the mark just as we treat domestic
uses under the <i>Tea Rose&#8211;Rectanus</i> doctrine, asking in both cases
whether the use elsewhere resulted in secondary meaning in the local market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We would go too far if we did away with the
territoriality principle altogether by expanding the famous-mark exception this
much. The territoriality principle has a long history in the common law,<a
href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[187]</span></span></span></a> and at least two circuits
have described it as �basic to trademark law.�<a href="#_ftn188"
name="_ftnref188" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[188]</span></span></span></a> That status reflects the
lack of a uniform trademark regime across international borders. What one must
do to acquire trademark rights in one country will not always be the same as
what one must do in another. And once acquired, trademark rights gained in
other countries are governed by each country's own set of laws.<a
href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[189]</span></span></span></a> Furthermore, we are
arguably required by the Paris Convention, of which the United States is a
signatory, to preserve the territoriality principle in some form.<a
href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[190]</span></span></span></a> Thus, we reject Grupo
Gigante's argument that we should define the well-known mark exception as merely
an inquiry into whether the mark has achieved secondary meaning in the area
where the foreign user wishes to assert protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To determine whether the famous-mark exception to
the territoriality rule applies, the district court must determine whether the
mark satisfies the secondary meaning test. The district court determined that
it did in this case, and we agree with its persuasive analysis. But secondary
meaning is not enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition, where the mark has not before been
used in the American market, the court must be satisfied, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a <i>substantial</i> percentage of consumers in the relevant
American market is familiar with the foreign mark. The relevant American market
is the geographic area where the defendant uses the alleged infringing mark. In
making this determination, the court should consider such factors as the
intentional copying of the mark by the defendant, and whether customers of the
American firm are likely to think they are patronizing the same firm that uses
the mark in another country. While these factors are not necessarily
determinative, they are particularly relevant because they bear heavily on the
risks of consumer confusion and fraud, which are the reasons for having a
famous-mark exception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the district court did not have the benefit
of this additional test, we vacate and remand so that it may be applied. We
intimate no judgment on whether further motion practice and some additions to
what the district court has already written in its published opinion will
suffice, or whether trial will be needed to apply this new test. Nor do we
intimate what the result should be. The concurring opinion is incorrect in its
suggestion that the case necessarily must go to trial because distinctiveness
of a mark is a question of fact and defendants have contested the reliability
of plaintiffs' survey evidence. That conclusion flies in the face of the 1986
triumvirate of summary judgment cases.<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191"

Regardless of whether questions are factual, there is nothing to try unless
there is a genuine issue of material fact. One survey that is impeachable, but
still good enough to get to a jury, weighed against no survey evidence at all
on the other side, along with all the other evidence in the record, does not
necessarily add up to a genuine issue of fact.</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>Paris Convention claims</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court properly held that Grupo
Gigante's claim for �use of a well-known mark� under Article 6 <i>bis</i> of
the Paris Convention is duplicative of its claim that, because the Gigante mark
is well-known, that mark is entitled to protection under the Lanham Act. The
district court also properly rejected Grupo Gigante's claim for unfair
competition under Article 10 <i>bis</i> of the Paris Convention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There has been some understandable confusion among
the district courts with respect to whether the Paris Convention, implemented
in � 44 of the Lanham Act, creates substantive law or a right of action
applicable to international trademark disputes. <i>Compare Mattel, Inc. v. MCA
Records, Inc.,</i> 28 F.Supp.2d 1120, 1158 (C.D.Cal.1998) (holding that the
Paris Convention does not create a right of action separate and distinct from
those available under the Lanham Act), <i>with Maison Lazard et Compagnie v.
Manfra, Tordella &amp; Brooks, Inc.,</i> 585 F.Supp. 1286, 1289 (S.D.N.Y.1984)
(holding that the Paris Convention creates a distinct cause of action for
unfair competition). That confusion results from the interplay between Article
10 <i>bis</i> and � 44 of the Lanham Act. As discussed above, Article 10 <i>bis</i>
requires member countries �to assure to nationals of [other member countries]
effective protection against unfair competition.� Paris Convention, art. 10 <i>bis,</i>
21 U.S.T. at 1648. Section 44 of the Lanham Act implements Article 10 <i>bis</i>
by extending Lanham Act protection to foreign nationals to the extent necessary
to satisfy the United States' treaty obligations:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Any person whose country of origin is a party to any
convention or treaty relating to trademarks, trade or commercial names, or the
repression of unfair competition, to which the United States is also a party,
or extends reciprocal rights to nationals of the United States by law, shall be
entitled to the benefits of this section under the conditions expressed herein
to the extent necessary to give effect to any provision of such convention,
treaty or reciprocal law, in addition to the rights to which any owner of a
mark is otherwise entitled by this chapter.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1126(b).<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Grupo Gigante uses the phrase �in addition to the
rights to which any owner of a mark is otherwise entitled to by this chapter�
to argue that � 44 of the Lanham Act implements certain additional substantive
rights created by international treaties. Although that may be true as a
general matter, Article 10 <i>bis</i> itself does not create additional
substantive rights. Rather, �[t]he Paris Convention ensures that �foreign
nationals should be given the same treatment in each of the member countries as
that country makes available to its own citizens' as to trademark and related
rights.� <i>Int'l Caf�, S.A.L. v. Hard Rock Caf� Int'l, Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d
1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting <i>Vanity Fair Mills, Inc. v. T. Eaton
Co.,</i> 234 F.2d 633, 640 (2d Cir. 1956)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we held in <i>Kemart Corp. v. Printing Arts
Research Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 269 F.2d 375, 389 (9th Cir.1959), �the Paris
Convention was not intended to define the substantive law in the area of �unfair
competition� of the signatory countries.� More recently, we concluded that the
interaction between � 44 of the Lanham Act and Article 10 <i>bis</i> of the
Paris Convention simply results in equal treatment of foreign and domestic
parties in trademark disputes:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A foreign national is entitled to the same �effective
protection against unfair competition� to which an American is entitled, Paris
Convention, art. 10b is, and in turn, the American gets the same right that the
foreign national gets.... But [a party] has no claim to a nonexistent federal
cause of action for unfair competition. As said, the Paris Convention provides
for national treatment, and does not define the substantive law of unfair
competition.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Mattel,</i> 296 F.3d at 908. <i>See also Int'l Caf�,</i>
252 F.3d at 1278 (holding that the Paris Convention �only requires �national
treatment� �).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the Paris Convention creates neither a
federal cause of action nor additional substantive rights, the district court
properly dismissed Grupo Gigante's Paris Convention claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>VACATED AND REMANDED.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>GRABER, Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I concur in the majority's opinion because I agree that a
foreign owner of a supposedly famous or well-known foreign trademark must show
a higher level of �fame� or recognition than that required to establish
secondary meaning. Ultimately, the standard for famous or well-known marks is
an intermediate one. To enjoy extraterritorial trademark protection, the owner
of a foreign trademark need not show the level of recognition necessary to
receive nation-wide protection against trademark dilution. On the other hand,
the foreign trademark owner who does not use a mark in the United States must
show more than the level of recognition that is necessary in a domestic
trademark infringement case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nonetheless, I write separately to express my view
that the evidence that Plaintiffs have presented thus far is insufficient as a
matter of law to establish that their mark is famous or well-known. The survey
population and the survey's results establish little more than the fact that
Plaintiffs' customers are familiar with Plaintiffs' stores. In an abundance of
caution, the majority does not intimate whether that evidence is sufficient to
warrant a grant of summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor on the issue of the
famous mark exception. I would go beyond intimation and hold directly that
Plaintiffs' evidence is insufficient to support a grant of summary judgment in
its favor. I would further hold that, unless the district court entertains a
renewed motion for summary judgment on a considerably expanded record, this
case should proceed to trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court, relying entirely on survey
evidence, concluded that Plaintiffs' trademark had acquired secondary meaning
and was thus entitled to protection from domestic users.<a href="#_ftn193"
name="_ftnref193" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[193]</span></span></span></a> The survey population
consisted of only 78 people in San Diego County who were �Spanish-speaking, and
had recently purchased Mexican-style food at a supermarket or other food
store.� <i>Grupo Gigante S.A. de C.V. v. Dallo &amp; Co., Inc.,</i> 119
F.Supp.2d 1083, 1093 (C.D.Cal. 2000). Twenty-four respondents from that
population �(1) had recently shopped at a Gigante store in Mexico; (2) believed
that the Gigante name was affiliated with an entity that had at least one store
located in Mexico; or (3) were aware of a Gigante supermarket located in
Mexico.� <i>Id.</i> However, the survey was conducted in 2000, nine years <i>after</i>
Defendants first began using the Gigante name in the United States. When
testing for awareness of the Gigante mark <i>before</i> Defendants' entry into
the San Diego market in 1991, the awareness level dropped to 20 to 22 percent
of the respondents. <i>Id.</i> That is, the district court based its conclusion
that Plaintiffs' mark was well known on a survey that turned up just <i>seventeen
people</i> who had heard of Gigante before 1991.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> That evidence is insufficient in two important
respects. First, the survey result is highly questionable in view of its
narrowly defined survey population. Plaintiffs' own description of their stores
makes clear that the goods sold are little different from those available in
any large retail grocery store: �Product offerings in the Gigante stores
generally include a complete selection of perishable and non-perishable foods
and a wide selection of general merchandise, as well as clothing and fashion
items.� Further, Plaintiffs admit in their briefs that the clientele of their
Mexican stores includes �both Hispanic and non-Hispanic� customers.
Consequently, nothing about <i>either</i> the nature of the goods sold by
Plaintiffs <i>or</i> its customer base warrants limiting the relevant public to
Mexican&#8211;Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have rejected similar attempts to limit the
relevant sector of the public. For instance, in <i>Japan Telecom, Inc. v. Japan
Telecom America Inc.,</i> 287 F.3d 866, 875 (9th Cir.2002), a trademark dispute
between two providers of telecommunications services, the plaintiff advertised
only to �members of the Japanese and Japanese American business communities in
Southern California.� Nonetheless, we concluded that �the relevant buying
public consists at least of buyers of telephone and network installation
services in that region.� <i>Id.</i> Thus, we emphasized <i>the nature of the
service provided,</i> rather than the composition of the market to which the
plaintiff actively targeted its services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because Plaintiffs sell widely-available,
non-specialized goods to the general public, it is uninformative to focus
exclusively on Mexican&#8211;Americans living in San Diego County. The district
court's reliance on Plaintiffs' survey is especially problematic because its
population was limited to Mexican&#8211;Americans who had recently purchased
Mexican-style food at a supermarket<b> </b>or grocery store. That survey is
only very slightly more informative than the study whose probative value we
dismissed entirely in <i>Avery Dennison Corp. v. Sumpton,</i> 189 F.3d 868 (9th
Cir. 1999), because it focused exclusively on the plaintiff's existing
customers: �Avery Dennison's marketing reports are comparable to a survey we
discussed in <i>Anti&#8211;Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, Inc.,</i>
684 F.2d 1316 (9th Cir. 1982), proving only the near tautology that consumers
already acquainted with Avery and Avery Dennison products are familiar with
Avery Dennison.� 189 F.3d at 879.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because a conclusion that Plaintiffs have a
protectable interest would prohibit Defendants from selling groceries under
that mark to <i>any</i> residents of San Diego County&#8212;not just to
Mexican&#8211;Americans&#8212;it makes little sense to define the relevant
public so narrowly. Comprised of all grocery shoppers, the �relevant sector of
the public� in this case is the very antithesis of a specialized market;
because everyone eats, the relevant sector of the public consists of all
residents of San Diego County, without qualification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, in view of the standard we announce today,
I do not believe that a showing that 20 to 22 percent of the relevant market is
familiar with the foreign mark establishes that a �significant� or
�substantial� percentage of that market is familiar with the foreign mark. On
that ground alone, I would conclude that Plaintiffs have failed, so far, to
show that their mark is famous or well-known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In terms of the level of fame, trademark dilution
cases often speak of a �significant percentage of the defendant's market.� <i>Mead
Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 875 F.2d 1026, 1031
(2d Cir. 1989). Discussing the level of recognition required to establish
�niche fame,� McCarthy argues that �a mark should not be categorized as
�famous' unless it is known to more than 50 percent of the defendant's
potential customers.� 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on Trademarks and
Unfair Competition,</i> � 24:112, at 24&#8211;271 (4th ed. 2002).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> I would adopt a similar standard for the exception
for famous or well-known foreign marks. When a foreign mark has not been used
in the United States, I would require the owner of the foreign mark to show,
through surveys and other evidence, that a majority of the defendant's
customers and potential customers, on aggregate, were familiar with the foreign
mark when the defendant began its allegedly infringing use. Admittedly, that is
a high standard. However, I believe that a stringent standard is required when
conferring trademark protection to a mark that has never been, and perhaps
never may be, used in this country. A conclusion that Plaintiffs' mark is
well-known in the relevant sector brings with it the right to oust Defendants
from their own market, notwithstanding the fact that they have established
priority of use. A bare showing of acquired distinctiveness should not suffice
to invert the ordinary allocation of trademark rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Of course, I recognize that the doctrine of �niche
fame� has received heavy, and in the context of <i>domestic</i> trademark law,
deserved criticism. However, the niche fame cases may provide the district
court with an instructive benchmark against which to measure an intermediate
standard of fame.<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[194]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In summary, I agree with the majority's conclusion
that this case must be remanded and the evidence reevaluated under a heightened
standard for the famous or well-known marks exception. However, I would hold
directly that the evidence presented thus far does not meet that standard and
thus does not suffice to warrant protection for Plaintiff's mark. Finally, in
determining whether a foreign mark has met the standard for famous or
well-known foreign trademarks, I would look to precedent from this court and
others addressing whether a mark has become famous in its market niche.</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>482 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2007)</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>RAGGI, Circuit Judge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case requires us to decide, among other
things, the applicability of the �famous marks� doctrine to a claim for unfair
competition under federal and state law. Plaintiffs ITC Limited and ITC Hotels
Limited (collectively �ITC�) held a registered United States trademark for
restaurant services: �Bukhara.� They sued defendants, Punchgini, Inc., Bukhara
Grill II, Inc., and certain named individuals associated with these businesses,
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(Gerard E. Lynch, <i>Judge</i> ) claiming that defendants' use of a similar
mark and related trade dress constituted trademark infringement, unfair
competition, and false advertising in violation of federal and state law. ITC
now appeals from the district court's award of summary judgment in favor of
defendants on all claims. <i>See ITC Ltd. v. Punchgini, Inc.,</i> 373 F.Supp.2d
275 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Having reviewed the record <i>de novo,</i> we
affirm the award of summary judgment on ITC's infringement claim, concluding,
as did the district court, that ITC abandoned its Bukhara mark for restaurant
services in the United States. To the extent ITC insists that the �famous
marks� doctrine nevertheless permits it to sue defendants for unfair
competition because its continued international use of the mark led to a
federally protected right, we conclude that Congress has not yet incorporated
that doctrine into federal trademark law.<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[195]</span></span></span></a>
Therefore, we affirm the award of summary judgment on ITC's federal unfair
competition claim. Whether the famous marks doctrine applies to a New York
common law claim for unfair competition and, if so, how famous a mark must be
to trigger that application, are issues not easily resolved by reference to
existing state law. Accordingly, we certify questions relating to these issues
to the New York Court of Appeals, reserving our decision on this part of ITC's
appeal pending the state court's response. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>A. The Bukhara Restaurant in New Delhi</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span

laws of India. Through its subsidiary, ITC Hotels Limited, it owns and operates
the Maurya Sheraton &amp; Towers, a five-star hotel in New Delhi, India. One of
the restaurants in the Maurya Sheraton complex is �Bukhara.� Named after a city
in Uzbekistan on the legendary Silk Road between China and the West, Bukhara
offers a cuisine and decor inspired by the northwest frontier region of India.
Since its opening in 1977, the New Delhi Bukhara has remained in continuous
operation, acquiring a measure of international renown.<a href="#_ftn196"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Over the past three decades, ITC has sought to
extend the international reach of the Bukhara brand. At various times, it has
opened or, through franchise agreements, authorized Bukhara restaurants in Hong
Kong, Bangkok, Bahrain, Montreal, Bangladesh, Singapore, Kathmandu, Ajman, New
York, and Chicago. As of May 2004, however, ITC-owned or -authorized Bukhara
restaurants were in operation only in New Delhi, Singapore, Kathmandu, and
Ajman.</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>B. ITC's Use of the Bukhara Mark in the United States</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>1. ITC's Use and Registration of the Mark for
Restaurants</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1986, an ITC-owned and -operated Bukhara
restaurant opened in Manhattan. In 1987, ITC entered into a franchise agreement
for a Bukhara restaurant in Chicago. Shortly after opening its New York
restaurant, ITC sought to register the Bukhara mark with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office (�Patent and Trademark Office�). On October 13,
1987, ITC obtained United States trademark registration for the Bukhara mark in
connection with �restaurant services.� <i>See</i> United States Trademark
Registration No. 1,461,445 (Oct. 13, 1987). The Manhattan restaurant remained
in operation for only five years, closing on December 17, 1991. On August 28,
1997, after a decade in business, ITC cancelled its Chicago franchise.
Notwithstanding its registration, ITC concedes that it has not owned, operated,
or licensed any restaurant in the United States using the Bukhara mark since
terminating the Chicago restaurant franchise.</p>

ITC filed an application with the Patent and Trademark Office to register a
�Dal Bukhara� mark in connection with packaged, ready-to-serve foods. In May
2003, ITC sold packaged Dal Bukhara food products to two distributors, one in
California and the other in New Jersey. One month later, in June 2003, ITC
exhibited Dal Bukhara products at the International Fancy Foods Show in New
York City.</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>C. The Opening of �Bukhara Grill�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Meanwhile, in 1999, named defendants Raja Jhanjee,
Vicky Vij, Dhandu Ram, and Paragnesh Desai, together with Vijay Roa,
incorporated �Punchgini, Inc.� for the purpose of opening an Indian restaurant
in New York City. Jhanjee, Vij, and Ram had all previously worked at the New
Delhi Bukhara, and Vij had also previously worked at ITC's New York Bukhara. In
selecting a name for their restaurant, the Punchgini shareholders purportedly
considered �Far Pavilions� and �Passage to India� before settling on �Bukhara
Grill.� As Vij candidly acknowledged at his deposition, there was then �no
restaurant Bukhara in New York, and we just thought we will take the name.� Vij
Dep. 25:7&#8211;11, May 5, 2004. After some initial success with �Bukhara
Grill,� several Punchgini shareholders, with the support of two additional
partners, defendants Mahendra Singh and Bachan Rawat, organized a second
corporation, �Bukhara Grill II, Inc.,� in order to open a second New York
restaurant, �Bukhara Grill II.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When the record is viewed in the light most
favorable to ITC, numerous similarities suggestive of deliberate copying can
readily be identified between the defendants' Bukhara Grill restaurants and the
Bukhara restaurants owned or licensed by ITC. Quite apart from the obvious
similarity in name, defendants' restaurants mimic the ITC Bukharas' logos,
decor, staff uniforms, wood-slab menus, and red-checkered customer bibs.
Indeed, the similarities were sufficiently obvious to be noted in a press
report, wherein defendant Jhanjee is quoted acknowledging that the New York
Bukhara Grill restaurant �is quite like Delhi's Bukhara.� Shweta Rajpal, �Dal
�Bukhara� in NY: A Bukhara-trained Trio Has Opened a Similar Restaurant in
Manhattan,� <i>Hindustan Times,</i> May 2, 2000; <i>see also</i> Bob Lape,

<p class=Opinionheading>D. Plaintiffs' Cease and Desist Letter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> By letter dated March 22, 2000, ITC, through
counsel, demanded that defendants refrain from further use of the Bukhara mark.
The letter accused defendants of unlawfully appropriating the reputation and
goodwill of ITC's Bukhara restaurants in India and the United States by
adopting a virtually identical name for their New York Bukhara Grill
restaurants. It further demanded, under threat of legal action, that defendants
acknowledge ITC's exclusive rights to the Bukhara mark, disclose the period for
which defendants had used the mark, and remit to ITC any profits derived
therefrom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In a response dated March 30, 2000, defendants'
counsel expressed an interest in avoiding litigation. Nevertheless, counsel
observed that ITC appeared to have abandoned the Bukhara mark by not using it
in the United States for several years. Receiving no reply, defendants' counsel
sent a second letter to ITC dated June 22, 2000, stating that, if no response
was forthcoming �by June 28, 2000, we will assume that ITC Limited has
abandoned rights it may have had in the alleged mark and any alleged claim
against our client.� Marsh Letter to Horwitz, June 22, 2000. The record
indicates no timely reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Instead, almost two years later, on April 15, 2002,
ITC's counsel wrote to defendants reiterating the demands made in March 2000
and complaining of defendants' failure formally to respond to that initial
letter. Defendants' counsel promptly challenged the latter assertion; faulted
ITC for failing to reply to his March 22, 2000 letter; and reasserted his
abandonment contention, a position that he claimed was now bolstered by the
passage of additional time. There was apparently no further communication among
the parties until this lawsuit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>E. The Instant Lawsuit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On February 26, 2003, ITC filed the instant
lawsuit. In the amended complaint that is the controlling pleading for purposes
of our review, ITC charged defendants with trademark infringement under section
32(1)(a) of the Lanham Act, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a), as well as
unfair competition and false advertising under sections 43(a) and 44(h) of the
Lanham Act, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. �� 1125(a), 1126(h). ITC also pursued parallel
actions under New York common law.<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[198]</span></span></span></a>
As an affirmative defense, defendants charged ITC with abandonment of its
United States rights to the Bukhara mark and, on that ground, they filed a
counterclaim seeking cancellation of the ITC registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Following discovery, defendants successfully moved
for summary judgment. In a detailed published decision, the district court
ruled that ITC could not pursue an infringement claim because the record
conclusively demonstrated its abandonment of the Bukhara mark as applied to
restaurants in the United States. <i>See ITC Ltd. v. Punchgini, Inc.,</i> 373
F.Supp.2d at 285. To the extent ITC asserted that its continued operation of
Bukhara restaurants outside the United States allowed it to sue defendants for
unfair competition under the famous marks doctrine, the district court was not
convinced. It observed that, even if it were to assume the applicability of the
famous marks doctrine, ITC had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to permit a
reasonable jury to conclude that the name or trade dress of its foreign
restaurants had attained the requisite level of United States recognition to
trigger the doctrine. <i>See id.</i> at 291. Finally, the district court found
that ITC lacked standing to pursue its false advertising claim. <i>See id.</i>
at 291&#8211;92. This appeal followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Before this court, ITC advances essentially three
arguments. It submits that (1) the record does not conclusively establish its
abandonment of United States rights in the Bukhara mark, (2) the district court
misapplied applicable federal and state law regarding the famous marks
doctrine, and (3) it has standing to sue defendants for false advertising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court determined that ITC had abandoned its

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>C. Unfair Competition</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>1. Federal Claim Under Section 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham
Act</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC claims that defendants violated section
43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act by engaging in unfair competition in the use of
its Bukhara mark and its related trade dress. Section 43(a)(1)(A) allows the
producer of a product or service to initiate a cause of action against a person
who uses �any word, term name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof
... which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship,
or approval of [the producer's] ... services.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(A). This
protection is broader than that afforded by section 32(1)(a), which prohibits
only infringement of marks actually registered with the Patent and Trademark
Office. <i>See Two Pesos v. Taco Cabana,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992) (�Section
43(a) prohibits a broader range of practices than does � 32, which applies to
registered marks, but it is common ground that � 43(a) protects qualifying
unregistered trademarks� (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); <i>accord</i>
<i>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc.,</i> 282 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir.2002).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To succeed on a section 43(a)(1)(A) claim, a
plaintiff must prove (1) that the mark or dress is distinctive as to the source
of the good or service at issue, and (2) that there is the likelihood of
confusion between the plaintiff's good or service and that of the defendant. <i>See
Yurman Design, Inc. v. PAJ, Inc.,</i> 262 F.3d 101, 115 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <i>Wal&#8211;Mart
Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros.,</i> 529 U.S. 205, 210 (2000)); <i>see also Two
Pesos v. Taco Cabana,</i> 505 U.S. at 768; <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Dooney
&amp; Bourke, Inc.,</i> 454 F.3d 108, 115 (2d Cir.2006). Preliminary to making
this showing, however, a plaintiff must demonstrate its own right to use the
mark or dress in question. <i>See Planetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc.,</i>
261 F.3d 1188, 1193 (11th Cir. 2001) (stating that plaintiff must show �that it
had prior rights to the mark at issue� in order to prevail in a section 43(a)
claim); <i>Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co.,</i> 695 F.2d 96, 103 (5th
Cir. 1983) (stating that where a section 43(a) claim is based on alleged
ownership of a mark, it is necessary to consider �[w]hether the mark has been
abandoned� before considering merits of claim); <i>P. Daussa Corp. v. Sutton
Cosmetics (P. R.), Inc.,</i> 462 F.2d 134, 136 (2d Cir. 1972) (�To be entitled
to relief, however, [plaintiff] must show not only confusing similarity, but
priority of right over [defendant] to the use of the [plaintiff's] mark.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In light of our conclusion that, as a matter of
law, ITC abandoned its registered Bukhara mark as of August 28, 2000, ITC
confronts a high hurdle in demonstrating that, at the time of defendants'
challenged actions, it possessed a priority right to the use of the Bukhara
mark and related trade dress for restaurants in the United States. <i>See Vais
Arms, Inc. v. Vais,</i> 383 F.3d at 292 n. 8 (noting that �abandonment results
in a break in the chain of priority�) (quoting 2 McCarthy, supra, � 17:4); <i>Emergency
One, Inc. v. American Fire Eagle Engine Co.,</i> 332 F.3d 264, 268 (4th
Cir.2003) (�The priority to use a mark ... can be lost through abandonment.�); <i>see
also Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co.,</i> 695 F.2d at 103&#8211;04
(observing that it would be �incongruous� to allow plaintiff who had abandoned
mark to successfully sue defendant for false designation or representation of
origin). To clear this hurdle, ITC invokes the famous marks doctrine. It
submits that, because (1) since 1977, it has continuously used its Bukhara mark
and trade dress outside the United States; and (2) that mark was renowned in
the United States before defendants opened their first Bukhara Grill restaurant
in New York in 1999, it has a priority right to the mark sufficient to claim
section 43(a)(1)(A) protection in this country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To explain why we disagree, we begin by discussing
the principle of trademark territoriality. We then discuss the famous marks
exception to this principle and the international treaties, implementing
legislation, and policy concerns relied on by ITC in urging the application of
this exception to this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;a. The Territoriality Principle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The principle of territoriality is basic to
American trademark law. <i>See American Circuit Breaker Corp. v. Or. Breakers,
Inc.,</i> 406 F.3d 577, 581 (9th Cir. 2005); <i>Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx
Corp.,</i> 369 F.3d 700, 714 (3d Cir. 2004); <i>Buti v. Impressa Perosa,
S.R.L.,</i> 139 F.3d 98, 103 (2d Cir. 1998); <i>Person's Co. v. Christman,</i>
900 F.2d 1565, 1568&#8211;69 (Fed.Cir. 1990). As our colleague, Judge Leval,
has explained, this principle recognizes that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>a trademark has a separate legal existence under each
country's laws, and that its proper lawful function is not necessarily to
specify the origin or manufacture of a good (although it may incidentally do
that), but rather to symbolize the domestic goodwill of the domestic markholder
so that the consuming public may rely with an expectation of consistency on the
domestic reputation earned for the mark by its owner, and the owner of the mark
may be confident that his goodwill and reputation (the value of the mark) will
not be injured through use of the mark by others in domestic commerce.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Osawa &amp; Co. v. B &amp; H Photo,</i> 589 F.Supp.
1163, 1171&#8211;72 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[199]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Precisely because a trademark has a separate legal
existence under each country's laws, ownership of a mark in one country does
not automatically confer upon the owner the exclusive right to use that mark in
another country. Rather, a mark owner must take the proper steps to ensure that
its rights to that mark are recognized in any country in which it seeks to
assert them. Cf. <i>Barcelona.com, Inc. v. Excelentisimo Ayuntamiento De Barcelona,</i>
330 F.3d 617, 628 (4th Cir. 2003) (�United States courts do not entertain
actions seeking to enforce trademark rights that exist only under foreign
law.�); <i>E. Remy Martin &amp; Co., S.A. v. Shaw&#8211;Ross Int'l Imports,
Inc.,</i> 756 F.2d 1525, 1531 (11th Cir. 1985) (�Our concern must be the
business and goodwill attached to United States trademarks, not French
trademark rights under French law.� (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we have already noted, United States trademark
rights are acquired by, and dependent upon, priority of use. <i>See supra</i>
at 146&#8211;47. The territoriality principle requires the use to be in the
United States for the owner to assert priority rights to the mark under the
Lanham Act. <i>See Buti v. Impressa Perosa, S.R.L.,</i> 139 F.3d at 103 (noting
that �Impressa's registration and use of the Fashion Caf� name in Italy has
not, given the territorial nature of trademark rights, secured it any rights in
the name under the Lanham Act�); <i>La Societe Anonyme des Parfums le Galion v.
Jean Patou, Inc.,</i> 495 F.2d at 1271 n. 4 (�It is well-settled that foreign
use is ineffectual to create trademark rights in the United States.�); <i>see
also Le Blume Import Co. v. Coty,</i> 293 F. 344, 350&nbsp; (2d Cir. 1923)
(observing that �the protection of a trade-mark in the United States is not to
be defeated by showing a prior use of a like trademark in France, or in some
other foreign country� so long as �the one claiming protection is able to show
that he was first to use it in this country�); cf. <i>Grupo Gigante S.A. De
C.V. v. Dallo &amp; Co.,</i> 391 F.3d 1088, 1093 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating
general proposition that �priority of trademark rights in the United States
depends solely upon priority of use in the United States, not on priority of
use anywhere in the world,� although recognizing famous marks doctrine as an
exception to territoriality principle (quoting 4 McCarthy, <i>supra,</i> �
29:2, at 29&#8211;6)). <i>But see International Bancorp, LLC v. Societe des
Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers a Monaco,</i> 329 F.3d 359, 381 (4th
Cir. 2003) (concluding that United States trademark rights can be acquired
merely through advertising in the United States combined with rendering of
services abroad to American customers). Thus, absent some use of its mark in
the United States, a foreign mark holder generally may not assert priority
rights under federal law, even if a United States competitor has knowingly
appropriated that mark for his own use. <i>See Person's Co. v. Christman,</i>
900 F.2d at 1569&#8211;70 (holding that foreign use is not sufficient to
establish priority rights even over a United States competitor who took mark in
bad faith).</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;b. The Famous Marks Doctrine as an Exception to
the Territoriality Principle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC urges us to recognize an exception to the
territoriality principle for those foreign marks that, even if not used in the
United States by their owners, have achieved a certain measure of fame within
this country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;(1) Origin of the Famous Marks Doctrine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The famous marks doctrine is no new concept. It
originated in the 1925 addition of Article <i>6bis</i> to the Paris Convention
for the Protection of Industrial Property, Mar. 20, 1883, as rev. at Stockholm,
July 14, 1967, 21 U.S.T. 1583, 828 U.N.T.S. 305 (�Paris Convention�). Article <i>6bis,</i>
which by its terms applies only to trademarks, requires member states</p>

<p class=Blockquote>ex officio if their legislation so permits, or at the
request of an interested party, to refuse or to cancel the registration, and to
prohibit the use, of a trademark which constitutes a reproduction, an
imitation, or a translation, liable to create confusion, of a mark considered
by the competent authority of the country of registration or use to be well
known in that country as being already the mark of a person entitled to the
benefits of this Convention and used for identical or similar goods. These
provisions shall also apply when the essential part of the mark constitutes a
reproduction of any such well-known mark or an imitation liable to create
confusion therewith.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Paris Convention, art. <i>6bis.</i><a href="#_ftn200"
name="_ftnref200" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[200]</span></span></span></span></a> One commentator has
observed that the �purpose� of Article <i>6bis</i> �is to avoid the
registration and use of a trademark, liable to create confusion with another
mark already well known in the country of such registration or use, although
the latter well-known mark is not, or not yet, protected in that country by a
registration which would normally prevent the registration or use of the
conflicting mark.� G.H.C. Bodenhausen, <i>Guide to the Application of the Paris
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property</i> 90 (1968).</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>(2) The Famous Marks Doctrine in the United States</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>(a) State Common Law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The famous marks doctrine appears first to have
been recognized in the United States by a New York trial court in a common law
action for unfair competition in the use of a trademark. <i>See Maison Prunier
v. Prunier's Rest. &amp; Caf�,</i> 159 Misc. 551, 557&#8211;58, 288 N.Y.S. 529,
535&#8211;36 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. 1936). The owner of �Maison Prunier,� a Paris
restaurant with a branch in London, sought to enjoin defendants' operation of a
New York City restaurant named �Prunier's Restaurant and Caf�.� The New York
restaurant had apparently adopted both the Paris restaurant's name and slogan
(�<i>Tout ce qui vient de la mer</i> �<a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[201]</span></span></span></a>)
and boldly advertised itself as �The Famous French Sea Food Restaurant.� While
the French plaintiff conceded that it had never operated a restaurant in the
United States, it nevertheless sought relief for the unauthorized use of its
name and mark under the common law of unfair competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In ruling in favor of the plaintiff, the trial
court first observed that �the right of a French corporation to sue here for
protection against unfair competition was expressly granted in [Article <i>10bis</i>
of] the [Paris] convention between the United States and various other powers
for the protection of industrial property.� <i>Id.</i> at 554, 288 N.Y.S. at
532.<a href="#_ftn202" name="_ftnref202" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[202]</span></span></span></a>
It then ruled that �actual competition in a product is not essential to relief
under the doctrine of unfair competition.� <i>Id.</i> at 555, 288 N.Y.S. at
533. The plaintiff was entitled to protection from � �any injury which might
result to it from the deception of the public through the unauthorized use of
its trade name, or a trade name which would lead the public to believe that it
was in some way connected with the plaintiff.� � <i>Id.</i> at 556, 288 N.Y.S.
at 534 (quoting <i>Long's Hat Stores Corp. v. Long's Clothes, Inc.,</i> 224
A.D. 497, 498, 231 N.Y.S. 107, 107 (1st Dep't 1928)). Although the court
acknowledged the general rule of territoriality, <i>see id.</i> at 557, 288
N.Y.S. 529, 288 N.Y.S. at 535 (noting no �right to protection against the use
of a trade-mark or trade name beyond the territory in which it operates�), it
recognized an exception to the rule where the second user was guilty of bad
faith, <i>see id.</i> at 557&#8211;58, 288 N.Y.S. at 536&#8211;37. The court
identified the fame of the mark as a factor relevant to deciding whether the
second user had, in good faith, made use of a mark without knowing of its prior
use by another party. <i>See id.</i> at 559, 288 N.Y.S. at 537. The <i>Prunier</i>
court concluded that the French plaintiff was entitled to protection against
unfair competition because its trademark enjoyed �wide repute� and the facts of
the case indicated a total lack of good faith on the part of the defendants. <i>Id.</i>
at 559, 288 N.Y.S. at 537. The basis of this holding, it should be noted, was
not Article <i>6bis</i> of the Paris Convention. Instead, the holding was based
entirely on New York common law principles of unfair competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> More than twenty years later, in <i>Vaudable v.
Montmartre, Inc.,</i> 20 Misc.2d 757, 193 N.Y.S.2d 332 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. 1959),
another New York trial court granted a different Paris restaurant, �Maxim's,�
injunctive relief against a New York City restaurant that had appropriated its
name, decor, and distinctive script style, all without permission. The court
concluded that the lack of direct competition between the two restaurants was
�immaterial� to a common law claim for unfair competition. <i>Id.</i> at 759,
193 N.Y.S.2d at 335. The only relevant question was whether �there had been a
misappropriation, for the advantage of one person, of a property right
belonging to another.� <i>Id.</i> at 759, 193 N.Y.S.2d at 335. Noting that the
Paris Maxim's had been in continuous operation since 1946, when it reopened
after World War II, the court concluded that its owners had priority rights as
against the junior American user by virtue of (1) their uninterrupted use of
the mark abroad, and (2) the fame of the �Maxim's� mark among �the class of
people residing in the cosmopolitan city of New York who dine out.� <i>Id.</i>
at 758, 193 N.Y.S.2d at 334.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A quarter century later, the federal Trademark
Trial and Appeal Board (�Trademark Board�) invoked <i>Vaudable's</i>
recognition of the famous marks doctrine in several <i>inter partes</i>
proceedings.<a href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[203]</span></span></span></a>
In <i>Mother's Rests., Inc. v. Mother's Other Kitchen, Inc.,</i> the Trademark
Board stated in <i>dictum</i> that:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[I]t is our view that prior use and advertising of a mark
in connection with goods or services marketed in a foreign country (whether
said advertising occurs inside or outside the United States) creates no
priority rights in said mark in the United States as against one who, in good
faith, has adopted the same or similar mark for the same or similar goods or
services in the United States prior to the foreigner's first use of the mark on
goods or services sold and/or offered in the United States at least unless it
can be shown that the foreign party's mark was, at the time of the adoption and
first use of a similar mark by the first user in the United States, a �famous�
mark within the meaning of <i>Vaudable v. Montmartre, Inc.</i></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>218 U.S.P.Q 1046, * 8 (TTAB 1983) (concluding that
customers would be likely to confuse the �Mother's Pizza Parlour� trademark
with the �Mother's Other Kitchen� trademark) (internal citation omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> That same year, the Trademark Board applied the
same reasoning in <i>All England Lawn Tennis Club, Ltd. v. Creations
Aromatiques,</i> 220 U.S.P.Q. 1069 (1983), granting plaintiff's request to
block registration of a trademark for �Wimbledon Cologne� even though plaintiff
was not itself using the Wimbledon mark on any product sold in the United
States. The Trademark Board observed that the Wimbledon mark had �acquired fame
and notoriety as used in association with the annual championships within the
meaning of Vaudable� and that �purchasers of applicant's cologne would
incorrectly believe that said product was approved by or otherwise associated
with the Wimbledon tennis championships and that allowance of the application
would damage opposer's rights to the mark.� <i>Id.</i> at * 10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Recently, the Trademark Board has reiterated in
dicta that owners of well known foreign marks need not use those marks in the
United States to challenge the registration of marks likely to promote
confusion on the part of consumers. <i>See, e.g., First Niagara Ins. Brokers,
Inc. v. First Niagara Fin. Group, Inc.,</i> 77 U.S.P.Q.2d 1334, *30&#8211;31
(2005), overruled on other grounds by <i>First Niagara Ins. Brokers, Inc. v.
First Niagara Fin. Group, Inc.</i>, 476 F.3d 867 (Fed.Cir. Jan. 9, 2007), 2007
U.S.App. LEXIS 367.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As this court has frequently observed, Trademark
Board decisions, �while not binding on courts within this Circuit, are
nevertheless �to be accorded great weight� � under general principles of administrative
law requiring deference to an agency's interpretation of the statutes it is
charged with administering. <i>Buti v. Impressa Perosa S.R.L.,</i> 139 F.3d at
105 (quoting <i>Murphy Door Bed Co. v. Interior Sleep Sys., Inc.,</i> 874 F.2d
95, 101 (2d Cir. 1989)); <i>see also In re Dr Pepper Co.,</i> 836 F.2d 508, 510
(Fed.Cir. 1987). In applying this principle to this case, however, we identify
a significant concern: nowhere in the three cited rulings does the Trademark
Board state that its recognition of the famous marks doctrine derives from any
provision of the Lanham Act or other federal law. Indeed, the federal basis for
the Trademark Board's recognition of the famous marks doctrine is never
expressly stated. Its reliance on <i>Vaudable</i> suggests that recognition
derives from state common law. At least one Trademark Board member, however,
has questioned whether state common law can support recognition of the famous
marks doctrine as a matter of federal law:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[I]t seems to me that the <i>Vaudable</i> decision
according protection to the famous Maxim's restaurant in the United States ...
is inapplicable in this case since that decision was based on a theory of
unfair competition, namely misappropriation, under the law of the State of New
York. Under Federal law, it seems to me that application of the well-known
marks doctrine depends on whether the applicable text of the Paris Convention
... and, in particular, Article <i>6bis</i> of that Convention, is
self-executing [so as to become part of federal law].</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Mother's Rests., Inc. v. Mother's Other Kitchen,
Inc.,</i> 218 U.S.P.Q 1046, *21 (Allen, concurring in part, dissenting in part)
(internal citations omitted). Because we conclude that the Trademark Board's
reliance on state law to recognize the famous marks doctrine falls outside the
sphere to which we owe deference, we consider <i>de novo</i> the question of
that doctrine's existence within federal trademark law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;(ii) Federal Case Law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To date, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is the
only federal appeals court to have recognized the famous marks doctrine as a
matter of federal law. <i>See Grupo Gigante S.A. De C.V. v. Dallo &amp; Co.,</i>
391 F.3d at 1088; cf. <i>International Bancorp, LLC v. Societe des Bains de Mer
et du Cercle des Estrangers a Monaco,</i> 329 F.3d at 389 n. 9 (Motz, J.,
dissenting) (noting that the famous marks doctrine has been applied so
infrequently that its viability is uncertain). In <i>Grupo Gigante,</i> 391
F.3d at 1088, the Ninth Circuit considered whether the �Gigante�
mark&#8212;registered and used by a large chain of grocery stores in Mexico
since 1963&#8212;was sufficiently well known among Mexican&#8211;Americans in
Southern California to afford it priority over a competing �Gigante� mark used
by a separate chain of Los Angeles grocery stores. In resolving this question,
the court ruled:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[T]here is a famous mark exception to the territoriality
principle. While the territoriality principle is a long-standing and important
doctrine within trademark law, it cannot be absolute. An absolute
territoriality rule without a famous-mark exception would promote consumer
confusion and fraud. Commerce crosses borders. In this nation of immigrants, so
do people. Trademark is, at its core, about protecting against consumer
confusion and �palming off.� There can be no justification for using trademark
law to fool immigrants into thinking that they are buying from the store they
liked back home.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 1094 (footnotes omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Grupo Gigante,</i> the Ninth Circuit did not
reference either the language of the Lanham Act nor Article <i>6bis</i> of the
Paris Convention to support recognition of the famous marks doctrine. Indeed,
elsewhere in its opinion, the court specifically stated that the Paris
Convention creates no �additional substantive rights� to those provided by the
Lanham Act. <i>Id.</i> at 1100. The court also acknowledged that the famous
marks doctrine is not recognized by California state law. <i>See id.</i> at
1101 (observing that cases cited by plaintiff �provide no support for the
conclusion that use anywhere in the world suffices to establish priority in
California�). Thus, it appears that the Ninth Circuit recognized the famous
marks doctrine as a matter of sound policy: �An absolute territoriality rule
without a famous marks exception would promote customer confusion and fraud.� <i>Id.</i>
at 1094.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court has twice referenced the famous marks
doctrine, but on neither occasion were we required to decide whether it does,
in fact, provide a legal basis for acquiring priority rights in the United
States for a foreign mark not used in this country. <i>See Buti v. Impressa
Perosa, S.R.L.,</i> 139 F.3d at 104 n. 2 (referencing Mother's Restaurant and
Vaudable but, in the end, concluding that famous marks doctrine �has no
application here given that Impressa has made no claim under that doctrine�); <i>see
also Empresa Cubana del Tabaco v. Culbro Corp.,</i> 399 F.3d at 481 (declining
to decide whether famous marks doctrine should be recognized because �even
assuming that the famous marks doctrine is otherwise viable and applicable, the
[Cuban] embargo bars [plaintiff] from acquiring property rights in the ... mark
through the doctrine�).<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> District courts in this Circuit have reached
varying conclusions about the applicability of the famous marks doctrine to
Lanham Act claims. In <i>Empresa Cubana Del Tabaco v. Culbro Corp.,</i> 213
F.Supp.2d at 283&#8211;84, Judge Sweet concluded that the rights identified in
Article <i>6bis</i> of the Paris Convention could not be pursued in a section
44(h) claim, but could be pursued under section 44(b). In an unpublished 2005
decision, <i>De Beers LV Trademark Ltd. v. DeBeers Diamond Syndicate, Inc.,</i>
2005 WL 1164073 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2005), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9307, Judge Cote
characterized the famous marks doctrine as a �controversial common law
exception to the territoriality principle,� <i>id.</i> at *21. Nevertheless,
she concluded that rights obtained by the operation of the doctrine at common
law could be asserted in a federal unfair competition action filed under
section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. <i>See id.</i> at *25&#8211;26; <i>see also De
Beers LV Trademark Ltd. v. DeBeers Diamond Syndicate Inc.,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d
249 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> That same year, in <i>Almacenes Exito S.A. v. El
Gallo Meat Market, Inc.,</i> Judge Rakoff reached a different conclusion,
ruling that �[t]o the extent the famous marks doctrine is a creature of common law
it may support state causes of action, but it has no place in federal law where
Congress has enacted a statute, the Lanham Act, that carefully prescribes the
bases for federal trademark claims,� 381 F.Supp.2d 324, 326&#8211;27 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)
(internal citation omitted). Identifying the territoriality principle as a
�bedrock principle of federal trademark law,� <i>id.</i> at 326, Judge Rakoff
concluded that recognition of a famous marks exception represented �such a
radical change in basic federal trademark law� that it could �only be made by
Congress, not by the courts,� <i>id.</i> at 328. He specifically rejected the
argument advanced here by ITC, i.e., that the Lanham Act itself recognizes a
famous marks exception by providing a foreign plaintiff with substantive rights
identified in Article <i>6bis.</i> He observed that �the Paris Convention, as
incorporated by the Lanham Act, only requires �national treatment.� � <i>Id.</i>
at 328 (internal quotation marks omitted). We agree with this analysis for
reasons discussed in the next two lettered subsections of this opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;(c) Treaties Protecting Famous Marks and United
States Implementing Legislation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC insists that Article <i>6bis</i> of the Paris
Convention, together with Article 16(2) of the Agreement on Trade&#8211;Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (�TRIPs�), <i>see</i> Uruguay Round
Agreements Act, Pub.L. No. 103&#8211;465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994) (codified as
amended at scattered sections of United States Code), provides legal support
for its claim to famous marks protection. As previously noted, Article <i>6bis</i>
provides for member states to the Paris Convention, upon the request of an
interested party,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>to prohibit the use of a trademark which constitutes a
reproduction, an imitation, or a translation, liable to create confusion, of a
mark considered by the competent authority of the country of registration or
use to be well known in that country as being already the mark of a person
entitled to the benefits of this Convention and used for identical or similar
goods.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Paris Convention, art. <i>6bis.</i> Further, TRIPs
Article 16(2) extends Article <i>6bis</i> to service marks, <i>see supra</i> at
156 n. 15.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the outset, we observe that ITC does not specifically
contend that these two treaty articles are self-executing. While <i>Vanity Fair
Mills v. T. Eaton Co.,</i> 234 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1956), might support such an
argument with respect to Article <i>6bis</i> protection of trademarks, <i>see
id.</i> at 640 (observing in <i>dictum</i> that, upon ratification by Congress,
the Paris Convention required �no special legislation in the United States ...
to make [it] effective here�), no similar conclusion can extend to Article
16(2) protection of service marks because TRIPs is plainly not a self-executing
treaty. <i>See In re Rath,</i> 402 F.3d 1207, 1209 n. 2 (Fed.Cir. 2005); <i>see
also</i> S.Rep. No. 103&#8211;412, at 13 (1994) (accompanying the Uruguay Round
Agreements Act, Pub.L. No. 103&#8211;465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994)) (stating that
TRIPs and other GATT agreements �are not self-executing and thus their legal
effect in the United States is governed by implementing legislation�). While
Congress has amended numerous federal statutes to implement specific provisions
of the TRIPs agreement, it appears to have enacted no legislation aimed
directly at Article 16(2).<a href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC nevertheless submits that Lanham Act sections
44(b) and (h) effectively incorporate the protections afforded famous marks by
the Paris Convention and TRIPs.<a href="#_ftn206" name="_ftnref206" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[206]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>In a lengthy analysis, the court concluded that �� 44(b)
&amp; (h) do not provide a basis for famous marks protection</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>(d) Policy Rationales Cannot, by Themselves, Support
Judicial Recognition of the Famous Marks Doctrine Under Federal Law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if the Lanham Act does not specifically
incorporate Article <i>6bis</i> and Article 16(2) protections for famous
foreign marks, ITC urges this court to follow the Ninth Circuit's lead and to
recognize the famous marks doctrine as a matter of sound policy. <i>See Grupo
Gigante S.A. De C.V. v. Dallo &amp; Co.,</i> 391 F.3d at 1094 (recognizing
famous marks doctrine because �[t]here can be no justification for using
trademark law to fool immigrants into thinking that they are buying from the
store they liked back home�). ITC argues that the United States cannot expect
other nations to protect famous American trademarks if United States courts
decline to afford reciprocal protection to famous foreign marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We acknowledge that a persuasive policy argument
can be advanced in support of the famous marks doctrine. <i>See, e.g., De Beers
LV Trademark Ltd. v. DeBeers Diamond Syndicate, Inc.</i>, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
9307, at *25 (noting that �[r]ecognition of the famous marks doctrine is
particularly desirable in a world where international travel is commonplace and
where the Internet and other media facilitate the rapid creation of business
goodwill that transcends borders�); Frederick W. Mostert, <i>Well&#8211;Known
and Famous Marks: Is Harmony Possible in the Global Village?</i>, 86 Trademark
Rep. 103, 106 (1996) (arguing that �protection of the global trading system
through the prevention of piracy and unfair exploitation of well-known marks
has become essential�). The fact that a doctrine may promote sound policy,
however, is not a sufficient ground for its judicial recognition, particularly
in an area regulated by statute. <i>See, e.g., Badaracco v. Comm'r,</i> 464
U.S. 386, 398 (1984) (�The relevant question is not whether, as an abstract
matter, the rule advocated by petitioners accords with good policy. The
question we must consider is whether the policy petitioners favor is that which
Congress effectuated by its enactment of [the statute].�). In light of the
comprehensive and frequently modified federal statutory scheme for trademark
protection set forth in the Lanham Act, we conclude that any policy arguments
in favor of the famous marks doctrine must be submitted to Congress for it to
determine whether and under what circumstances to accord federal recognition to
such an exception to the basic principle of territoriality. <i>See Almacenes
Exito S.A. v. El Gallo Meat Mkt., Inc.,</i> 381 F.Supp.2d at 326&#8211;28.
Absent such Congressional recognition, we must decline ITC's invitation to
grant judicial recognition to the famous marks doctrine simply as a matter of
sound policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For all these reasons, we affirm the district
court's award of summary judgment in favor of defendants on ITC's federal
unfair competition claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;2. State Common Law Claim for Unfair Competition</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;a. ITC's Reliance on the Famous Marks Doctrine to
Sue for Unfair Competition Under New York Law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ITC submits that, even if we affirm the district
court's dismissal of its federal unfair competition claim, we must reverse the
dismissal of its parallel state law claim. As it correctly observes, New York
common law allows a plaintiff to sue for unfair competition where a �property
right or a commercial advantage� has been �misappropriated.� <i>Flexitized,
Inc. v. National Flexitized Corp.,</i> 335 F.2d 774, 781&#8211;82 (2d Cir. 1964).
Nevertheless, in light of ITC's abandonment of the Bukhara mark and dress for
restaurants in the United States, its common law assertion of a �property right
or a commercial advantage� in these designations based on their foreign use
depends on whether New York recognizes the famous marks doctrine in the
circumstances here at issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we have already noted, at least two New York
cases indicate such recognition as a general matter: <i>Vaudable v. Montmartre,
Inc.,</i> 20 Misc.2d 757, 193 N.Y.S.2d 332, and <i>Maison Prunier v. Prunier's
Rest. &amp; Caf�,</i> 159 Misc. 551, 288 N.Y.S. 529. Neither the New York Court
of Appeals nor any intermediate New York appellate court, however, has ever
specifically adopted the views expressed in <i>Prunier</i> and <i>Vaudable</i>
to accord common law protection to the owners of famous marks. Moreover, no New
York court has clearly delineated a standard for determining when a mark
becomes sufficiently famous to warrant protection. �In the absence of
authoritative law from the state's highest court, we must either (1) predict
how the New York Court of Appeals would resolve the state law question, or, if
state law is so uncertain that we can make no reasonable prediction, (2)
certify the question to the New York Court of Appeals for a definitive
resolution.� <i>DiBella v. Hopkins,</i> 403 F.3d 102, 111 (2d Cir. 2005). In
this case, we opt for certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;b. Certifying the Question of New York's Common
Law Recognition of the Famous Marks Doctrine</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>(1) Standard for Certification</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> New York law and Second Circuit Local Rule � 0.27
permit us to certify to the New York Court of Appeals �determinative questions
of New York law [that] are involved in a case pending before [us] for which no
controlling precedent of the Court of Appeals exists.� N.Y. Comp.Codes R. &amp;
Regs. tit. 22, � 500.27(a). In deciding whether to certify a question, we
consider, <i>inter alia,</i> �(1) the absence of authoritative state court
interpretations of the [law in question]; (2) the importance of the issue to
the state, and whether the question implicates issues of state public policy;
and (3) the capacity of certification to resolve the litigation.� <i>Morris v.
Schroder Capital Mgmt. Int'l,</i> 445 F.3d 525, 531 (2d Cir.2006) (internal
quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>(2) Certified Question 1: Does New York Recognize the
Famous Marks Doctrine?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, we conclude that these factors weigh
in favor of certifying the question of New York's recognition of the famous
marks doctrine. First, the only New York cases to address the question of
whether state common law recognizes the famous marks doctrine, Vaudable and
Prunier, are decades-old trial court decisions. While these decisions are
routinely cited by non-New York courts as accurate statements of the state's
common law of unfair competition,<a href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[207]</span></span></span></a>
and while commentators routinely identify the cases as foundational in the
development of the famous marks doctrine,<a href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[208]</span></span></span></a>
the lack of authoritative adoption of the famous marks doctrine by New York's
highest court weighs in favor of certification. Second, recognition of the
famous marks doctrine as part of New York common law is plainly an important
policy issue for a state that plays a pivotal role in international commerce.
This factor strongly counsels in favor of our soliciting the views of the New
York Court of Appeals. <i>See generally Board of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S.
564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (observing that property
interests �are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or
understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law�).
Finally, certification will conclusively resolve the question of whether ITC's
state unfair competition claim was, in fact, properly dismissed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, we certify the following question to
the New York Court of Appeals: �Does New York common law permit the owner of a
famous mark or trade dress to assert property rights therein by virtue of the
owner's prior use of the mark or dress in a foreign country?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;(3) Certified Question 2: How Famous Must a Mark
Be to Come Within the Famous Marks Doctrine?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If the New York Court of Appeals were to answer the
first certified question in the affirmative, we ask it to consider a second
query: �How famous must a foreign mark or trade dress be to permit its owner to
sue for unfair competition?�<a href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[209]</span></span></span></a>
Although we have had no prior occasion to address this question, we note the
availability of a number of possible standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) <i>Secondary Meaning</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If New York were inclined to recognize a broad
famous marks doctrine, the Court of Appeals might conclude that a foreign
mark's acquisition of �secondary meaning� in the state was sufficient to accord
it common law protection. �Secondary meaning� is a term of art referencing a
trademark's ability to � �identify the source of the product rather than the
product itself.� � <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. at 766
n. 4 (quoting <i>Inwood Labs., Inc., v. Ives Labs., Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 851
n. 11 (1982)); <i>see Allied Maint. Corp. v. Allied Mech. Trades, Inc.,</i> 42
N.Y.2d 538, 545 (1977) (explicating �secondary meaning� under New York law); <i>see
also Genesee Brewing Co. v. Stroh Brewing Co.,</i> 124 F.3d 137, 143 n. 4 (2d
Cir. 1997) (identifying factors relevant to determining secondary meaning).
Under this standard, a court deciding whether to accord famous marks protection
would consider only whether the source of the foreign mark is well known in New

Gigante</i> the Ninth Circuit specifically rejected �secondary meaning� as the
appropriate standard for application of the famous marks doctrine. That federal

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;(b) Secondary Meaning Plus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Instead, the Court of Appeals might consider the
Ninth Circuit's compromise standard, which can be described as �secondary
meaning plus.� <i>See id.</i> at 1098 (holding that �secondary meaning is not
enough�). Under this test, �where the mark has not before been used in the
American market,<a href="#_ftn210" name="_ftnref210" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[210]</span></span></span></a>
the court must be satisfied, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a <i>substantial</i>
percentage of consumers in the relevant American market is familiar with the
foreign mark.� <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> 4 McCarthy, <i>supra,</i>
� 29:4, at 29&#8211;17 (suggesting that a �substantial� percentage of consumers
in the relevant American market would be at least 50%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judge Graber, concurring in <i>Grupo Gigante,</i>
emphasized the intermediate character of this standard:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>I agree that a foreign owner of a supposedly famous or
well-known foreign trademark must show a higher level of �fame� or recognition
than that required to establish secondary meaning. Ultimately, the standard for
famous or well-known marks is an intermediate one. To enjoy extraterritorial
trademark protection, the owner of a foreign trademark need not show the level
of recognition necessary to receive nation-wide protection against trademark
dilution. On the other hand, the foreign trademark owner who does not use a
mark in the United States must show more than the level of recognition that is
necessary in a domestic trademark infringement case.</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>&nbsp;(c) The Anti&#8211;Dilution Statute Standard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Precisely because �secondary meaning plus� is an
intermediate standard, the Court of Appeals might also consider the high
standard of recognition established by section 43(c) of the Lanham Act, the
federal anti-dilution statute. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c). Under that
federal law, four non-exclusive factors are relevant when determining whether a
mark is sufficiently famous for anti-dilution protection:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of
advertising and publicity of the mark, whether advertised or publicized by the
owner or third parties;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of
goods or services offered under the mark;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March
3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> � 1125(c)(2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under the federal anti-dilution statute, the holder
of a mark deemed famous under this test may seek an injunction against another
person who, �at any time after the owner's mark has become famous, commences
use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by
blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the
presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual
economic injury.� <i>Id.</i> � 1125(c)(1). ITC does not sue for dilution in
this case. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals might consider whether the
factors set out in the statute provide a useful guide for defining famous marks
generally.</p>

articulate an entirely new and different standard of recognition for the
application of the famous marks doctrine, among the factors it might consider
are those identified as relevant in the non-binding �Joint Recommendation
Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well&#8211;Known Marks,� adopted by
the World Intellectual Property Organization in 1999:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) the degree of knowledge or recognition of the mark in

of the mark;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) the duration, extent and geographical area of any
promotion of the mark, including advertising or publicity and the presentation,
at fairs or exhibitions, or the goods and/or services to which the mark
applies;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(4) the duration and geographical area of any
registrations, and/or any application for registration, of the mark, to the
extent that they reflect use or recognition of the mark;</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;&quot;Does New York common law permit the

country?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;The Second Circuit's first certified question
calls upon us to define property rights in the context of a common-law unfair
competition claim grounded on a theory of misappropriation. Thus, we must
consider <a name=Document1zzSDUNumber18></a>whether a famous foreign mark
constitutes property or a commercial advantage protected from unfair
competition under New York law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have long recognized two theories of common-law
unfair competition: palming off and misappropriation (<i>see Electrolux Corp. v
Val-Worth, Inc.</i>, 6 NY2d 556, 567-568 [1959] [discussing the acceptance of
these theories of unfair competition in New York courts and collecting cases]).
&quot;Palming off&quot;&#8212;that is, the sale of the goods of one
manufacturer as those of another<a name="Document1zzFN_B0022"></a><a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[211]</span></span></span></a>&#8212;was the first theory
of unfair competition endorsed by New York courts, and &quot;has been extended
. . . to situations where the parties are not even in competition&quot; (<i>Electrolux</i>,
6 NY2d at 567, citing <i>Elgin Nat. Watch Co. v Illinois Watch Case Co.</i>,
179 US 665, 674 [1901];<i>Neva-Wet Corp. v Never Wet Processing Corp.</i>, 277

affirmed without opinion by this Court, omitted]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After the United States Supreme Court sanctioned
the misappropriation theory of unfair competition in <i>International News
Service v Associated Press</i> (248 US 215 [1918]), &quot;[t]he principle that
one may not misappropriate the results of the skill, expenditures and labors of
a competitor has . . . often been implemented in [New York] courts&quot; (<i>Electrolux</i>,
6 NY2d at 567, citing <a name=Document1zzSDUNumber19></a><i>Germanow v Standard
Unbreakable Watch Crystals, Inc.</i>, 283 NY 1, 18 [1940]; <i>Fisher v Star Co.</i>,
231 NY 414, 428 [1921]; <i>see also Meyers v Waverly Fabrics, Div. of
Schumacher &amp; Co.</i>, 65 NY2d 75, 79-80 [1985] [acknowledging defendant's
possible liability for &quot;violation of the law of unfair competition by
misrepresenting the (uncopyrighted) design, which it knew to be plaintiff's, as
its own&quot; (numerous citations omitted)]; <i>National Basketball Assn. v
Motorola, Inc.</i>, 105 F3d 841, 847-853 [2d Cir 1997] [accepting
misappropriation as a theory under New York common law]). Indeed, the New York
cases cited by the District Court and the Second Circuit as embodying the
famous or well-known marks doctrine in New York common law&#8212;<i>Prunier</i>
and <i>Vaudable&#8212;</i>were, in fact, decided wholly on misappropriation
theories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Prunier</i>, the plaintiff operated
celebrated haute cuisine restaurants in Paris and London, but none in the
United States. The defendants opened a restaurant in New York and </p>

<p class=Blockquote>&quot;appropriated to themselves the plaintiff's name. . .
. Indeed, it was admitted . . . that the name was intentionally selected
because of plaintiff's well-known reputation and good will which has been built
up as the result of decades of honest business effort. </p>

<p class=Blockquote>&quot;The defendants den[ied], however, that they ever held
themselves out as being Prunier's of Paris&quot; (159 Misc at 553). <a
name=Document1zzSDUNumber20></a></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;The court upheld the legal viability of an unfair
competition claim by the plaintiff&#8212;even though the two restaurants were
not in direct competition&#8212;so long as &quot;plaintiff['s] conten[tion] that
its reputation extends far beyond the territorial limits of Paris and London
and that it has a substantial following <i>in New York city</i> and in other
parts of the world&quot; was proved (<i>id.</i> at 559 [emphasis added]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Vaudable</i>, the plaintiff's restaurant in
Paris--Maxim's--was internationally famous &quot;in the high-class restaurant
field&quot; (20 Misc 2d at 758-759). The defendants &quot;appropriate[d] the
good will plaintiffs [had] created in the name Maxim's as a restaurant,&quot;
and were therefore held liable for unfair competition based on misappropriation
even though the parties were &quot;not in present actual competition&quot; (<i>id.</i>
at 759). &quot;The trend of the law, both statutory and decisional,&quot; the
court opined, &quot;has been to extend the scope of the doctrine of unfair
competition, whose basic principle is that commercial unfairness should be
restrained whenever it appears that there has been a misappropriation, for the
advantage of one person, of a property right belonging to another&quot; (<i>id.</i>
at 759 [citations omitted]; <i>see also Roy Export Co. v Columbia Broadcasting
Sys.</i>, 672 F2d 1095, 1105 [2d Cir 1982] [with decline of general federal
common law after inception of misappropriation branch of unfair competition
tort in <i>International News Service</i>, &quot;the <a
name=Document1zzSDUNumber21></a>doctrine was developed by the states, New York
in particular; there it has flourished in a variety of factual
settings&quot;]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="Document1zzHI_b1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> While
expositors of the famous marks doctrine point to <i>Prunier</i> and <i>Vaudable</i>
(<i>see</i> 5 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition � 29:4 n 2 [4th ed
2007] [citing <i>Prunier</i> and <i>Vaudable</i> as &quot;(p)erhaps the most
famous examples&quot; of the &quot;well known&quot; marks doctrine]), <i>Prunier</i>
and <i>Vaudable</i> themselves in no way explain or proclaim&#8212;let alone
rely on&#8212;any famous or well-known marks doctrine for their holdings.
Instead, <i>Prunier</i> and <i>Vaudable</i> fit logically and squarely within
our time-honored misappropriation theory, which prohibits a defendant from
using a plaintiff's property right or commercial advantage&#8212;in <i>Prunier</i>
and <i>Vaudable</i>, the goodwill attached to a famous name&#8212;to compete
unfairly against the plaintiff in New York.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under New York law, &quot;[a]n unfair competition
claim involving misappropriation usually concerns the taking and use of the
plaintiff's property to compete against the plaintiff's own use of the same
property&quot; (<i>Roy Export</i>, 672 F2d at 1105). The term &quot;commercial
advantage&quot; has been used interchangeably with &quot;property&quot; within
the meaning of the misappropriation theory (<i>see Flexitized, Inc. v National
Flexitized Corp.</i>, 335 F2d 774, 781-782 [2d Cir 1964]). What <i>Prunier</i>
and <i>Vaudable</i> stand for, then, is the proposition that for certain kinds
of businesses (particularly cachet <a name=Document1zzSDUNumber22></a>goods/services
with highly mobile clienteles), goodwill can, and does, cross state and
national boundary lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, while we answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the
first certified question, we are not thereby recognizing the famous or
well-known marks doctrine, or any other new theory of liability under the New
York law of unfair competition. Instead, we simply reaffirm that when a
business, through renown in New York, possesses goodwill constituting property
or a commercial advantage in this state, that goodwill is protected from
misappropriation under New York unfair competition law. This is so whether the
business is domestic or foreign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III.</p>

<p class=Opinionheading>Certified Question No. 2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;&quot;How famous must a foreign mark or trade
dress be to permit its owner to sue for unfair competition?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="Document1zzHI_b2"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> Protection
from misappropriation of a famous foreign mark presupposes the existence of
actual goodwill in New York (<i>see e.g. Roy Export</i>, 672 F2d at 1105
[misappropriation under New York law usually requires use in state of
plaintiff's property or commercial advantage to compete against plaintiff]). If
a foreign plaintiff has no goodwill in this state to appropriate, there can be
no viable claim for unfair competition under a theory of misappropriation. At
the very least, a plaintiff's mark, when used in New York, must call to mind <a
name=Document1zzSDUNumber23></a>its goodwill. Otherwise, a plaintiff's property
right or commercial advantage based on the goodwill associated with its mark is
not appropriated in this state when its unregistered mark is used here. Thus,
at a minimum, consumers of the good or service provided under a certain mark by
a defendant in New York must primarily associate the mark with the foreign
plaintiff (<i>cf. Allied Maintenance Corp. v Allied Mech. Trades</i>, 42 NY2d
538, 545 [1977]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Whether consumers of a defendant's goods or
services primarily associate such goods or services with those provided by a
foreign plaintiff is an inquiry that will, of necessity, vary with the facts of
each case. Accordingly, we cannot&#8212;and do not&#8212;provide an exhaustive
list of the factors relevant to such an inquiry. That said, some factors that
would be relevant include evidence that the defendant intentionally associated
its goods with those of the foreign plaintiff in the minds of the public, such
as public statements or advertising stating or implying a connection with the
foreign plaintiff; direct evidence, such as consumer surveys, indicating that
consumers of defendant's goods or services believe them to be associated with
the plaintiff; and evidence of actual overlap between customers of the New York
defendant and the foreign plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If the customers of a New York defendant do not
identify a mark with the foreign plaintiff, then no use is being made of the plaintiff's
goodwill, and <a name=Document1zzSDUNumber24></a>no cause of action lies under
New York common law for unfair competition. As a result, to prevail against
defendants on an unfair competition theory under New York law, ITC would have
to show first, as an independent prerequisite, that defendants appropriated
(i.e., deliberately copied), ITC's Bukhara mark or dress for their New York
restaurants. If they successfully make this showing, plaintiffs would then have
to establish that the relevant consumer market for New York's Bukhara restaurant
primarily associates the Bukhara mark or dress with those Bukhara restaurants
owned and operated by ITC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span

answered in accordance with this opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>�Well-known marks

the New York Court of Appeals opinion not included in the excerpt above, the
court addressed the terminological ambiguity over the correct name of the

<p class=Blockquote>There is some ambiguity regarding the proper name for what
has been variously called the &quot;famous marks doctrine,&quot; the
&quot;well-known marks doctrine&quot; <a name=Document1zzSDUNumber25></a>and
the &quot;famous mark doctrine&quot; (<i>see e.g.</i> 5 McCarthy on Trademarks
and Unfair Competition � 29:4 [4th ed 2007] [using the above names
interchangeably]). Apparently, the use of &quot;well-known&quot; in place of
&quot;famous&quot; took hold after the Lanham Act was amended by passage of the
Federal Trademark Anti-Dilution Act of 2006, which uses &quot;famous&quot; as a
term of art (<i>see </i>15 USC � 1125 [c]). At any rate, &quot;famous&quot; and
&quot;well-known,&quot; &quot;mark&quot; and &quot;marks,&quot; have been used
interchangeably to describe the putative doctrine, and no distinction is
intended by our choice of words here.</p>

Zobmondo has established that collections of bizarre questions beginning with
the words �would you rather� were posed in printed media before Falls Media
began using the phrase as a mark. But this does not establish that there is no

consumers to be part of a �WOULD YOU RATHER ... ?� game of questions.</p>

Zobmondo argues that its trademark applications were filed by Horn before he
had obtained legal advice about the distinctiveness of marks. Maybe so, but
this is a contested fact, and, whatever might be the conclusion on that after
trial and findings of fact, for purposes of summary judgment we must give all
reasonable inferences in favor of Falls Media. For these summary judgment
purposes, Falls Media is entitled to the inference that Zobmondo's trademark
applications are to a degree an admission that at the time Zobmondo viewed the
mark as suggestive.</p>

the use of the false designation of origin occurred �willfully and with intent
to deceive.� <i>Ibid.</i> As a result, �[a]lmost no reported decision can be

The deleterious effects of false advertising were described by one commentator
as follows: �[A] campaign of false advertising may completely discredit the
product of an industry, destroy the confidence of consumers and impair a
communal or trade good will. Less tangible but nevertheless real is the injury
suffered by the honest dealer who finds it necessary to meet the price
competition of inferior goods, glamorously misdescribed by the unscrupulous
merchant. The competition of a liar is always dangerous even though the exact
injury may not be susceptible of precise proof.� Handler, Unfair Competition,

The common-law tort of passing off has been described as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Beginning in about 1803, English and American common law
slowly developed an offshoot of the tort of fraud and deceit and called it
�passing off� or �palming off.� Simply stated, passing off as a tort consists
of one passing off his goods as the goods of another. In 1842 Lord Langdale
wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>� �I think that the principle on which both the courts of
law and equity proceed is very well understood. A man is not to sell his own

Consistent with the common-law background of � 43(a), the Second Circuit has
said that proof of secondary meaning is required to establish a claim that the
defendant has traded on the plaintiff's good will by falsely representing that
his goods are those of the plaintiff. See, <i>e.g., Crescent Tool Co. v.
Kilborn &amp; Bishop Co.,</i> 247 F. 299 (1917). To my knowledge, however, the
Second Circuit has not explained why �inherent distinctiveness� is not an
appropriate substitute for proof of secondary meaning in a trade dress case.
Most of the cases in which the Second Circuit has said that secondary meaning
is required did not involve findings of inherent distinctiveness. For example,
in <i>Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc.,</i> 652 F.2d 299 (1981),
cert. denied, 455 U.S. 909, 102 S.Ct. 1257, 71 L.Ed.2d 448 (1982), the product
at issue&#8212;a velcro belt&#8212;was functional and lacked �any distinctive,
unique or non-functional mark or feature.� 652 F.2d, at 305. Similarly, in <i>Stormy
Clime Ltd. v. ProGroup, Inc.,</i> 809 F.2d 971, 977 (1987), the court described
functionality as a continuum, and placed the contested rainjacket closer to the
functional end than to the distinctive end. Although the court described the
lightweight bag in <i>LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart Corp.,</i> 754 F.2d 71 (1985),
as having a distinctive appearance and concluded that the District Court's
finding of nonfunctionality was not clearly erroneous, <i>id.,</i> at 74, it
did not explain why secondary meaning was also required in such a case.</p>

The Senate Report elaborated on these two goals:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�The purpose underlying any trade-mark statute is twofold.
One is to protect the public so it may be confident that, in purchasing a
product bearing a particular trade-mark which it favorably knows, it will get
the product which it asks for and wants to get. Secondly, where the owner of a
trade-mark has spent energy, time, and money in presenting to the public the
product, he is protected in his investment from its misappropriation by pirates
and cheats. This is the well-established rule of law protecting both the public
and the trade-mark owner.� S.Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1946).</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>By protecting trademarks, Congress hoped �to protect
the public from deceit, to foster fair competition, and to secure to the
business community the advantages of reputation and good will by preventing
their diversion from those who have created them to those who have not. This is
the end to which this bill is directed.� <i>Id.</i>, at 4.</p>

Forty years later, the USTA Trademark Review Commission assessed the state of
trademark law. The conclusion that it reached serves as a testimonial to the
success of the Act in achieving its goal of uniformity: �The federal courts now
decide, under federal law, all but a few trademark disputes. State trademark
law and state courts are less influential than ever. Today the Lanham Act is
the paramount source of trademark law in the United States, as interpreted
almost exclusively by the federal courts.� Trademark Review Commission, 77

As the Senate Report explained, revision of � 43(a) is designed �to codify the
interpretation it has been given by the courts. Because Section 43(a) of the
Act fills an important gap in federal unfair competition law, the committee
expects the courts to continue to interpret the section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�As written, Section 43(a) appears to deal only with false
descriptions or representations and false designations of geographic origin.
Since its enactment in 1946, however, it has been widely interpreted as creating,
in essence, a federal law of unfair competition. For example, it has been
applied to cases involving the infringement of unregistered marks, violations
of trade dress and certain nonfunctional configurations of goods and actionable
false advertising claims.� S.Rep. No. 100&#8211;515, p. 40 (1988) U.S.Code

law protects the public by making consumers confident that they can identify

The phrase �secondary meaning� originally arose in the context of word marks,
where it served to distinguish the source-identifying meaning from the
ordinary, or �primary,� meaning of the word. �Secondary meaning� has since come
to refer to the acquired, source-identifying meaning of a nonword mark as well.
It is often a misnomer in that context, since nonword marks ordinarily have no
�primary� meaning. Clarity might well be served by using the term �acquired
meaning� in both the word-mark and the nonword-mark contexts-but in this
opinion we follow what has become the conventional terminology.</p>

One commentator has noted that marks consisting of symbols and designs are
typically arbitrary with respect to their associated goods and services where
the marks are �nonrepresentational�:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Nonverbal and nonrepresentational designs and figures are
perfectly acceptable as trademarks. Indeed, they have the advantage of being
totally arbitrary, and so cannot be descriptive of the goods or services. The
only problem which may be encountered is the question of whether such designs
or figures are regarded by the public as identifying indicia or merely as
decorations. Especially is this true of such simple figures as rectangles,
diamonds, circles, triangles, or lines.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>LOUIS ALTMAN &amp; MALLA POLLACK, 3 CALLMAN ON UNFAIR
COMPETITION, TRADEMARKS AND MONOPOLIES � 18:24 (4th ed.2010) (footnotes
omitted). Under this reasoning, nonverbal marks&#8212;even though
�arbitrary�&#8212;must still be shown to serve as identifying indicia.
Professor McCarthy appears to share the view that such marks are arbitrary when
they are nonrepresentational. <i>See</i> 1 MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS � 7:36, at
7&#8211;91 (�A picture that is merely a representation of the goods themselves
is regarded as merely descriptive of the goods.�).</p>

As noted above, the district court omitted discussion of the fourth factor,
which by its terms applies only when a party seeks trademark protection for a
background design typically accompanied by words. <i>See Amazing Spaces,</i>
665 F.Supp.2d at 736. Similarly, we will not consider the fourth <i>Seabrook
Foods</i> factor.</p>

The Second Circuit has also used a related test that asks �whether [the mark]
is �likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.� � <i>Knitwaves,
Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd.,</i> 71 F.3d 996, 1008 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting <i>Duraco
Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters.,</i> 40 F.3d 1431, 1449 (3d Cir.1994)).
Although the <i>Knitwaves</i> court quoted the <i>Duraco Products</i> court for
part of its test, it rejected the requirements that the product configuration
�be �unusual and memorable� and �conceptually separable from the product.� � <i>Id.</i>
at 1009 n. 6 (quoting <i>Duraco Prods.,</i> 40 F.3d at 1449); <i>see also
Stuart Hall Co. v. Ampad Corp.,</i> 51 F.3d 780, 787&#8211;88 (8th Cir.1995)
(rejecting the <i>Duraco Products</i> test as inconsistent with <i>Two Pesos</i>
by imposing additional, non-statutory requirements). The First Circuit has, in
turn, criticized the <i>Knitwaves</i> test as inconsistent with <i>Two Pesos</i>
because it fails to keep the inherent distinctiveness inquiry separate from the
secondary meaning inquiry. <i>See I.P. Lund Trading,</i> 163 F.3d at 41. This
case does not require us to delve into the propriety of these variations on the
<i>Seabrook Foods</i> test, and we do not do so.</p>

We note, of course, that the <i>Wal&#8211;Mart</i> Court was urged by the
respondent in that case and by the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> to
adopt the <i>Seabrook Foods</i> test writ large for product design but declined
to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 213&#8211;14, 120 S.Ct. 1339. The Court's concern was
that �[s]uch a test would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of
an anticompetitive strike suit.� <i>Id.</i> at 214, 120 S.Ct. 1339. However, as
discussed below, we are of the opinion that the relevant portions of the <i>Seabrook
Foods</i> test do provide a basis for summary disposition in this case. Because
we conclude that the Star Symbol is not inherently distinctive under the <i>Seabrook
Foods</i> test, we do not address whether it constitutes a �reasonably clear test,�
<i>id.</i> at 213, such that it would be preferable to the <i>Abercrombie</i>
test in the ordinary trademark or service mark dispute.</p>

The interrelationship between these inquiries is also reflected in Professor
McCarthy's discussion of common geometric shapes:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Most common geometric shapes are regarded as not being
inherently distinctive, in view of the common use of such shapes in all areas
of advertising. Thus, such ordinary shapes as circles, ovals, squares, etc.,
either when used alone or as a background for a word mark, cannot function as a
separate mark unless (1) the shape is likely to create a commercial impression
on the buyer separate from the word mark or any other indicia and (2) the shape
is proven to have secondary meaning.... The rationale is that such designs have
been so widely and commonly used as mere decorative graphic elements that the
origin-indicating ability of such designs has been diminished.</p>

The parties dispute the scope of the �relevant market�&#8212;specifically,
whether the district court correctly considered use of a similar or identical
star design beyond the self-storage service industry. Amazing Spaces contends
that we should limit our analysis to the self-storage services industry, while
Metro argues that we may take into account uses of star designs in a larger
context. The second <i>Seabrook Foods </i>factor refers to uniqueness or
unusualness �in a particular field,� 568 F.2d at 1344, and the Second Circuit
has stated that a stylized design may be protectable when it �is not
commonplace but rather unique or unusual in the relevant market,� <i>Star
Indus.,</i> 412 F.3d at 382. Similarly, the third factor refers to whether a
mark is commonly used as ornamentation for a �particular class of goods.� <i>Seabrook
Foods,</i> 568 F.2d at 1344. In contrast, the First Circuit, in considering
whether a red heart on the chest of a teddy bear was inherently distinctive,
appeared to consider the broader use of red hearts in determining whether the
use at issue was unique or unusual. <i>See Wiley,</i> 762 F.2d at 142 (�[T]he
record contains so many examples of use of a red heart motif on teddy bears and
other stuffed animals,<i> not to mention all manner of other toys and
paraphernalia,</i> that no reasonable argument on this point can be made.�
(emphasis added)). The rule in the RESTATEMENT asks whether, �because of the
nature of the designation and <i>the context in which it is used,</i>
prospective purchasers are likely to perceive it as a designation that ...
identifies goods or services produced or sponsored by a particular person.�
RESTATEMENT � 13(a), at 104 (emphasis added). It further explains that</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[c]ommonplace symbols and designs are not inherently
distinctive since their appearance on numerous products makes it unlikely that
consumers will view them as distinctive of the goods or services of a
particular seller. Thus, unless the symbol or design is striking, unusual, or
otherwise likely to differentiate the products of a particular producer, the
designation is not inherently distinctive.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> � 13 cmt. d, at 107. Finally, and most
importantly, the Lanham Act defines �service mark� as a mark used �to identify
and distinguish the services of one person ... from the services of others and
to indicate the source of the services.� Lanham Act � 45, 15 U.S.C. � 1127.
Because a mark must distinguish one person's services from another, we agree
that our inquiry is whether the Star Symbol identifies and distinguishes
Amazing Spaces's self-storage services from others' self-storage services. This
does not mean, however, that we must blind ourselves to uses beyond the
self-storage services industry: the fact that the same or a similar star is
used in countless other ways certainly bears on whether it is �likely that
prospective purchasers will perceive [a given star design] as an indication of
source� within a particular industry because a �[c]ommonplace symbol[']s ...
appearance on numerous products makes it unlikely that consumers will view [it]
as distinctive of the goods or services of a particular seller.� RESTATEMENT �

Under this analysis, use by third parties of a design bears on whether the
design is inherently distinctive, not merely whether the design �is a �strong�
or a �weak� [ ]mark.� <i>Exxon Corp. v. Tex. Motor Exchange of Houston, Inc.,</i>
628 F.2d 500, 504 (5th Cir.1980); <i>cf. Union Nat'l Bank of Tex., Laredo,
Tex.,</i> 909 F.2d at 848 n. 25 (noting that widespread industry use can render
a mark not inherently distinctive, but third-party use otherwise typically

This is what differentiates the Star Symbol from the examples of registered
marks containing stars that Amazing Spaces cites to support the protectability
of five-pointed stars. The Dallas Cowboys star is stylized through the
inclusion of a white border. The star in the Wal&#8211;Mart registration is a
plain, five-pointed star, but the registered mark consists of more than just
the star&#8212;the mark is the words �Wal� and �Mart� on either side of the
star. The LanChile Airlines star is set against a circle that is 50% filled in,
and it is adjacent to the words �LanChile Airlines.� Finally, the USA Truck
mark is a complex design consisting of a white star within a blue circle, set
against a white rectangle with blue borders and a red stripe running across the
middle. Each of these marks contains elements distinguishing it from the
commonplace stars in the record. <i>See Union Nat'l Bank of Tex., Laredo, Tex.,</i>
909 F.2d at 848 n. 25 (noting that the appropriate inquiry is whether the mark
as a whole is protectable, not whether its component parts are individually
protectable (citing <i>Estate of P.D. Beckwith v. Comm'r of Patents,</i> 252
U.S. 538, 40 S.Ct. 414, 64 L.Ed. 705 (1919))).</p>

It is well known that the law of �functionality� has been applied in both a
�utilitarian� sense and in terms of �aesthetics.� See e.g., Vuitton et Fils
S.A. v. J. Young Enterprises, Inc., 644 F.2d 769, 210 USPQ 351 (9th Cir. 1981);
International Order of Job's Daughters v. Lindeburg and Co., 633 F.2d 912, 208
USPQ 718 (9th Cir. 1980); Famolare, Inc. v. Melville Corp., 472 F.Supp. 738,
203 USPQ 68 (D.Hawaii 1979). Recognition of this provides an explanation for
the statement that, �the term �functional� is not to be treated as synonymous
with the literal significance of the term �utilitarian�.� J.C. Penney Co. v.
H.D. Lee Mercantile Co., 120 F.2d 949, 954, 50 USPQ 165, 170 (8th Cir. 1941).
It will be so treated, however, where the issue is one of �utilitarian
functionality� and not �aesthetic functionality.� The PTO does not argue in this
case that appellant's container configuration is aesthetically functional,
notwithstanding appellant's argument that its design was adopted, in part, for
aesthetic reasons.</p>

It is interesting to note that appellant also owns design patent 238,655 for the
design in issue, which, at least presumptively, indicates that the design is
not de jure functional. See In re Schilling, 421 F.2d 747, 750, 164 USPQ 576,
578 (CCPA 1970); In re Garbo, 48 CCPA 845, 848, 287 F.2d 192, 193-94, 129 USPQ

Perhaps the solicitor was of the same opinion. Continually referencing �the
container,� he concluded that, � �Essentially functional� subject matter is
just that-it doesn't matter whether it results in a competitive edge or not.
Either way, essentially functional subject matter is not registrable.�</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>We have refrained from using phrases such as
�essentially functional,� �primarily functional,� and �dictated primarily by
functional considerations� to denote the legal consequence, all of which use
the word �functional� in the lay sense of the term. If, in the legal sense, a
particular design is functional, such adverbs as �essentially� and �primarily�
are without meaning. Either a design is functional (de jure) or it is not.</p>

<i>TrafFix</i> suggests that there may be a requirement under <i>Qualitex</i>

Talking Rain argues that its bottle design, which by definition serves as a
holder of liquid, is merely �de facto� functional. But the bottle does more
than hold liquid. Specifically, its grip area makes the bottle easier to hold
than other bottles. Thus, the bottle is �de jure� functional. <i>See Leatherman

The Draft Restatement's Illustrations expressly reject <i>Pagliero.</i>
Illustration 6 reads as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote><i>A</i> manufactures china. Among the products marketed by
<i>A</i> is a set of china bearing a particular �overall� pattern covering the
entire upper surface of each dish. Evidence indicates that aesthetic factors
play an important role in the purchase of china, that <i>A</i>'s design is
attractive to a significant number of consumers, and that the number of
alternative patterns is virtually unlimited. In the absence of evidence
indicating that similarly attractive �overall� patterns are unavailable to

read as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 6, <i>A</i>'s
design consists solely of a thin gold band placed around the rim of each dish.
Evidence indicates that a significant number of consumers prefer china
decorated with only a gold rim band. Because the number of alternative designs
available to satisfy the aesthetic desires of these prospective purchasers is
extremely limited, the rim design is functional under the rule stated in this
Section.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>8. <i>A</i> is the first seller to market candy intended
for Valentine's Day in heart-shaped boxes. Evidence indicates that the shape of
the box is an important factor in the appeal of the product to a significant
number of consumers. Because there are no alternative designs capable of
satisfying the aesthetic desires of these prospective purchasers, the design of
the box is functional under the rule stated in this Section.</p>

In 1938, the Restatement of Torts stated that �[a] feature of goods is
functional ... if it affects their purpose, action or performance, or the
facility or economy of processing, handling or using them; it is non-functional
if it does not have any of such effects.� Restatement of Torts � 742 (1938). In
the official comment to that Section, the Restatement explained several ways in
which goods or their features might be functional. With regard to �goods [that]
are bought largely for their aesthetic value,� the Restatement suggested that
�their features may be functional because they definitely contribute to that
value and thus aid the performance of an object for which the goods are
intended.� <i>Id.</i> � 742, cmt. a. This was the first time that a commentator
had proposed that an aesthetic product feature might be functional. <i>See</i>

The doctrine of aesthetic functionality remains controversial in our sister
circuits, which have applied the doctrine in varying ways (and some not at
all). For example, the Seventh Circuit has applied the doctrine of aesthetic
functionality liberally, holding that �[f]ashion is a form of function.� <i>See
Jay Franco &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Franek,</i> 615 F.3d 855, 860 (7th Cir. 2010).
The Sixth Circuit recently discussed the doctrine, but made clear that it has
not yet decided whether or not to adopt it. <i>See Maker's Mark Distillery,
Inc. v. Diageo N. Am., Inc.,</i> 679 F.3d 410, 417&#8211;19 (6th Cir. 2012).
The Ninth Circuit has applied the doctrine inconsistently. <i>See</i> 1
McCarthy on Trademarks � 7:80 (4th ed.) (collecting cases). The Fifth Circuit
rejects the doctrine of aesthetic functionality entirely. <i>Bd. of Supervisors
for La. State Univ. Agric. &amp; Mech. Coll. v. Smack Apparel Co.,</i> 550 F.3d
465, 487&#8211;88 (5th Cir. 2008) (arguing that the Supreme Court has
recognized the aesthetic functionality doctrine only in <i>dicta,</i> and that
therefore the Fifth Circuit's long-standing rejection of the doctrine was not

The intellectual property protection of fashion design has been for years a
subject of controversy among commentators. Some have proposed working within
the confines of the current intellectual property system, while others have
advocated that fashion design may be an appropriate area for <i>sui generis</i>
statutory protection. <i>See generally</i> C. Scott Hemphill &amp; Jeannie Suk,
<i>The Law, Culture, and Economics of Fashion,</i> 61 Stan. L.Rev. 1147 (2009);
<i>see also id.</i> at 1184&#8211;90. (Indeed, suggested legislation creating
such protection has been considered several times by Congress, although not
adopted. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Design Piracy Prohibition Act, H.R.2033, 110th Cong.
� 2(c) (2007); Design Piracy Prohibition Act, S.1957, 110th Cong. � 2(c)
(2007).) Still other commentators have suggested that intellectual property
protection of fashion design would be damaging to the industry and should be
avoided. <i>See</i> Kal Raustiala &amp; Christopher Sprigman, <i>The Piracy
Paradox: Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design,</i> 92 Va.

The trademark system, in this way, stands in sharp contrast to the copyright
system. Copyright, unlike trademark, rewards creativity and originality even if
they interfere with the rights of an existing copyright holder. In the
copyright system there is a defense to infringement known as �independent
creation�: if a writer or musician, through the creative process, independently
arrives at an arrangement of words or notes that is the subject of a copyright,
he may market the result of his creativity despite the existing copyright. <i>See
Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co.,</i> 499 U.S. 340, 346, 111 S.Ct.
1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (requesting that the reader �assume that two
poets, each ignorant of the other, compose identical poems. Neither work is
novel, yet both are original and, hence, copyrightable�); <i>Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. v. Colgate&#8211;Palmolive Co.,</i> 199 F.3d 74, 77&#8211;78 (2d
Cir.1999). The trademark system, unlike the copyright system, aims to prevent
consumer confusion even at the expense of a manufacturer's creativity: in
trademark, if a branding specialist produces a mark that is identical to one
already trademarked by another individual or corporation, he must �go back to
the drawing board.� <i>See Blendco, Inc. v. Conagra Foods, Inc.,</i> 132
Fed.Appx. 520, 523 (5th Cir.2005) (although defendant's allegedly independent
creation of infringing mark tended to show that infringement was not willful,
defendant remained liable for damages); <i>Tuccillo v. Geisha NYC, LLC,</i> 635

Compare the much more sensible approach of District Judge Dorsey in the
District of Connecticut. In <i>New Colt Holding Corp. v. RJG Holdings of
Florida, Inc</i>., 312 F. Supp. 2d 195, 219 (D. Conn. 2004), the defendant
produced working replicas of plaintiff�s historic revolvers, in particular, the
Colt Peacemaker that plaintiff had been producing since 1873.&nbsp; The
plaintiff claimed the appearance of the revolver as protectable trade
dress.&nbsp; In response to the defendant�s argument that this trade dress was
aesthetically functional, Judge Dorsey explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' revolver is aesthetically
functional because they and other replica makers would no longer be able to
make replicas of the revolvers in question and they would no longer be able to
meet the �consumer need� of those such as cowboy action shooters who seek
historically accurate revolvers but cannot afford to purchase Plaintiffs'
revolvers. The argument is baseless. Assuming that Plaintiffs' trade dress is
otherwise protectable, the fact that such protection would shut down a replica
industry that is infringing Plaintiffs' trade dress is not a reason to find
aesthetic functionality.</p>

The Gilson treatise explains why the difference between the two categories
might matter:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The test for determining whether a mark is deceptive under
Section 2(a) is now the same as that for determining whether a mark is
primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive under Section 2(e)(3). The
difference comes with respect to registrability: Geographically deceptive marks
cannot be registered on either the Principal or Supplemental Register, while
primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks may be registered on
the Principal Register if the marks became distinctive of the goods or services
before December 8, 1993, and they may be registered on the Supplemental Register
if they have been in use in commerce since before December 8, 1993</p>

In our earlier order outlining the applicable law, the statement that the
perceptions of the general public are irrelevant refers to the ultimate legal
determination. It does not foreclose evidence of general perception. If, for
example, numerous dictionary definitions unanimously included a usage
characterization indicating a term is offensive, contemptuous, etc. that could
be evidence of the general perception of a term and could serve to support a
finding that the referenced group finds the term to be disparaging.</p>

Respondent�s position that the term REDSKINS has a separate meaning as the name
of a football team does not affect the first prong of the test because even as
the name of the football team it retains the meaning Native American. <i>See
infra</i> discussion of <i>Squaw Valley</i>, 80 USPQ2d 1264.</p>

In the <i>Harjo</i> case, on appeal, the District Court noted its concern about
the breadth of the issues presented noting: �Under the broad sweep of the
TTAB�s logic, no professional sports team that uses Native American imagery
would be permitted to keep their trademarks if the team�s fans or the media
took any action or made any remark that could be construed as insulting to
Native Americans. The Court cannot accept such an expansive doctrine;
particularly when premised on a finding that is not supported by any
substantial evidence. ... This is undoubtedly a �test case� that seeks to use
federal trademark litigation to obtain social goals.� <i>Pro-Football, Inc. v.
Harjo</i>, 68 USPQ2d at 1254, 1262. In contrast, this case presents a much
narrower issue and pertains only to the word REDSKINS. With regard to the
District Court�s observation about �social goals,� the underlying purpose of
this portion of the Trademark Act is, in effect, a social goal as legislated by
Congress, to keep matter that would disparage others off of the register. The
statutory requirement to remove disparaging matter from the register is not
obfuscated in the present case by peripheral issues.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<div id=ftn123>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref123" name="_ftn123" title=""><span

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[123]</span></span></span></a>
There is no case in our review where a term found to be a racial slur in
general was found not to be disparaging when used in the context of specific
services. The District Court in <i>Harjo</i> noted that �[t]he ultimate legal
inquiry is whether the six trademarks at issue may disparage Native Americans
when used in connection with Pro-Football�s services and during the relevant
time frame . . . [t]he ultimate legal inquiry is not whether the term
�redskins� is a pejorative term for Native Americans.� <i>Pro-Football, Inc. v.
Harjo</i>, 68 USPQ2d at 1252. This does not mean that if the record shows that
the term is pejorative, or a racial slur, that such a showing could not add to
the evidence supporting a finding that a substantial composite of the
referenced group find it disparaging, even when used solely with the recited
services. Moreover, if a term is found to be a racial slur, then it may be
possible to find the term disparaging in the context of the specific services
without evidence as to the specific services. In <i>Squaw Valley</i>, in making
a determination regarding the second prong of the disparagement test, the Board
relied on evidence that showed the �opinions of Native Americans regarding the
term are not limited to particular contexts.� <i>Squaw Valley</i>, 80 USPQ2d at
1276.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>Thus, if it is shown that a term is generally
disparaging, e.g., a racial slur, in any context, that includes the specific
context of the subject goods or services, and to that extent the comment by the
District Court as to the ultimate legal determination does not limit the
avenues by which a deciding court or tribunal arrives there. <i>See Heeb</i>,
89 USPQ2d at 1077 (�[A] term is considered to be disparaging by a substantial
composite of the referenced group, regardless of context, including in
connection with applicant�s identified goods and services.�)</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>As noted by the Board in <i>Squaw Valley</i>, in the
context of an <i>ex parte</i> proceeding we are by necessity limited to
inferential evidence. In the context of an <i>inter partes</i> proceeding, the
parties are not so limited and may present direct evidence, but that does not
render indirect evidence non probative. In particular, with a claim of
disparagement of a referenced group brought by individuals, the individual
plaintiffs may testify as to their perceptions regarding a term and the context
of the specific services, but to prove it is disparaging to a substantial
composite of the group, more general evidence can be probative. The
hypothetical evidentiary dilemma posed by the Board in <i>Squaw Valley</i>, the
difficulty of finding statements about use in connection with paperclips, is
also applicable to the <i>inter partes</i> context. <i>Squaw Valley</i>, 80
USPQ2d at 1277 n. 9. Thus, just as in an <i>ex parte</i> context where a term
may be found to be generally disparaging in any context and prohibited from
registration for a specific context, even absent evidence of the referenced
group making a statement as to that specific context, such an evidentiary
record may also be sufficient in an <i>inter partes</i> case.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>Respondent�s expert, Dr. Ronald Butters (discussed <i>infra</i>),
sheds some light on this issue. On the one hand he testifies that disparagement
is tied to intent when considering the term redskins, which includes the
context of use, but that the word nigger is inherently disparaging regardless
of context and presumably intent.� Thus, if the evidence regarding the inherent
nature of the term is strong�, that would be probative of disparagement in any
context to the perception of the referenced group within the context of the
specific services without direct evidence.</p>

Mr. Barnhart and Dr. Butters offered conclusions that the term ��redskin(s)�
has taken on a secondary meaning as the name of respondent�s team�. However,
this evidence goes to the first prong of the test where it is found and
conceded that the asserted �secondary meaning� retains the ��core meaning�
Native American. Because REDSKINS used in connection with respondent�s services
while meaning a football team, retains its �core meaning� identifying a �race
of people,� the meanings are not legally separate for the purposes of
determining disparagement under Section 2(a).</p>

This ownership test is not for the purpose of establishing the �use in
commerce� jurisdictional predicate of the Lanham Act. <i>See, e.g., Univ. of

This ownership requirement parallels the statutory definition of �trademark�:
�any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof ... used by a
person ... to identify and distinguish his or her goods ... from those
manufactured or sold by others ....� 15 U.S.C. � 1127. The Seventh Circuit has
held that a higher quantum of use may be necessary to establish ownership
rights under common law than under the statute because the notice function of
registration is lacking. <i>See Zazu Designs v. L'Oreal, S.A.,</i> 979 F.2d
499, 503-04 (7th Cir.1992). In addition, the continuity of a user's commercial
activities in connection with the mark is also relevant to determining whether
use is sufficient to establish common law ownership. <i>Circuit City Stores,
Inc. v. CarMax, Inc.,</i> 165 F.3d 1047, 1054-55 (6th Cir.1999) (�A party
establishes a common law right to a trademark only by demonstrating that its
use of the mark was �deliberate and continuous, not sporadic, casual or
transitory.� �).</p>

1289, 1293, 1993 WL 270522 (N.D.Cal.1993) for the proposition that there must
be a sale in order to satisfy the �use in commerce� requirement. <i>Future
Domain,</i> however, turned not on the <i>existence</i> of sales but whether
the extent of the purported mark owner's activities created a public
association between the mark and the product. There, the court determined that
a computer software manufacturer's promotion of a mark at a trade show&#8212;where
at most 7,000 persons actually received or requested information about the mark
and where no orders were taken&#8212;was not sufficient to create such an
association. <i>Id.</i> at 1293-95.</p>

Courts applying the �totality of circumstances� approach routinely have found
evidence of a few sales of goods to which the mark had been affixed
insufficient to establish trademark ownership. For example, in <i>Zazu Designs,</i>
979 F.2d at 503-04, the plaintiff hair salon had sold a few bottles of shampoo
bearing the mark �Zazu� both over the counter and mailed over state lines. The
court found that such limited sales �neither link the Zazu mark with [the
plaintiff's] product in the minds of consumers nor put other producers on
notice.� <i>Id.</i> at 503.</p>

In his lengthy dissent, Justice Stevens expressed his dismay that the decision
of a single trademark examiner in an ex parte proceeding a decade earlier,
followed by the registrant�s perfunctory filing of a declaration of
incontestability, could somehow prevent the Court from striking from the
Principal Register an �inherently unregistrable� mark.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>Park
�N Fly</i>, 469 U.S. at 206&#8211;07 (Stevens, J., dissenting).&nbsp; He also
added his own opinion of trademark quality at the PTO for good measure. <i>See
id</i>. at 212 (�No matter how dedicated and how competent administrators may be,
the possibility of error is always present, especially in nonadversary
proceedings.� (footnote omitted)). In a footnote to this statement, Justice
Stevens quoted a PTO official who testified to Congress that �at any one time,
about 7 percent of our 25 million documents are either missing or misfiled.� <i>Id</i>.

May registrants take advantage of their rights under Lanham Act � 43(a),
dealing with unregistered marks, to claim profits and damages even where the
registrant did not provide statutory notice?&nbsp; McCarthy suggests that the
answer is no:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The more problematic question is whether a registrant who
proves infringement under both � 32(1) (registered mark) and � 43(a)
(unregistered mark) can avoid the notice limitation imposed by � 29 by claiming
all of its damages fall under the � 43(a) count. A strict reading of the
statutory language of � 29 would, in the author's opinion, lead to the
conclusion that such a registrant cannot avoid the � 29 damage limitation by
using � 43(a). Section 29 does not distinguish between the kind of statutory
infringement that a registrant proves. Rather, � 29 simply states that no
profits and damages shall be recovered �under the provisions of this Act�
unless statutory or actual notice was given.</p>

The Lanham Act does not explicitly state that the benefits of � 7(c) should be
available only to applications filed on or after the effective date of the

on the one hand and the registration date creating constructive notice [under �
22] on the other hand, limiting the later to a case where �the application for
registration is filed before the effective date of the Trademark Law Revision

Section 44 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1126 (1982), permits qualified
foreign applicants who own a registered mark in their country of origin to
obtain a U.S. trademark registration without alleging actual use in U.S.
commerce. If a U.S. application is filed within six months of the filing of the
foreign application, such U.S. registration will be accorded the same force and
effect as if filed in the United States on the same date on which the
application was first filed in the foreign country. The statutory scheme set
forth in � 44 is in place to lower barriers to entry and assist foreign
applicants in establishing business goodwill in the United States. Person's Co.
does not assert rights under � 44, which if properly applied, might have been
used to secure priority over Christman.</p>

There are no other cases that directly guide us here. Although international
trademark law has recognized both the territoriality principle and the
exception for famous and well-known marks since 1925, remarkably, no case
addressed meaningfully the exception before the district court's decision
below. Since that decision, only one case has confronted the issue. <i>Empresa
Cubana del Tabaca v. Culbro Corp.,</i> 70 U.S.P.Q.2d 1650, 2004 WL 602295

Although the term �famous marks� is often used to describe marks that qualify
for protection under the federal anti-dilution statute, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. �
1125(c), the �famous marks� doctrine is, in fact, a different and distinct
�legal concept under which a trademark or service mark is protected within a
nation if it is well known in that nation even though the mark is not actually
used or registered in that nation,� 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition,</i> � 29.2, at 29&#8211;164 (4th ed.2002).
Thus, the famous marks doctrine might more aptly be described as the famous foreign
marks doctrine. It is in this latter sense that we reference the famous marks
doctrine on this appeal.</p>

The �territoriality principle� stands in contrast to the so-called
�universality principle,� which posits that �if a trademark [is] lawfully

transported to another country where the exclusive right to the mark was held
by someone other than the owner of the merchandise.� <i>Osawa &amp; Co. v. B

copier of an article overtly and explicitly misrepresents its source[, for
example], where [a] defendant . . . substituted its product for plaintiff's
when customers specifically asked for plaintiff's product&quot; (<i>Remco
Indus., Inc. v Toyomenka, Inc.</i>, 286 F Supp 948, 954 [SD NY 1968], <i>affd </i>397
F2d 977 [2d Cir 1968] [citation omitted]; <i>see also Shaw v Time-Life Records</i>,
38 NY2d 201, 206 [1975] [defendant &quot;could not 'palm off' its records as
being the personal work of&quot; plaintiff under New York unfair competition
law]).</p>
