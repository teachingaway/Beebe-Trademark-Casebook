of Publicity </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The right of publicity protects a person�s identity against unauthorized
commercial exploitation.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>J.
Thomas McCarthy, The Rights of Publicity and Privacy</span> �1:3 (2d ed. Apr.
2014) (defining the right of publicity as �the inherent right of every human
being to control the commercial use of his or her identity�).&nbsp; There is no
federal right of publicity, though as we will see below, Lanham Act � 43(a), 15
U.S.C. � 1125(a), may form the basis for a cause of action akin to one that
protects publicity rights.&nbsp; Right of publicity claims are typically
pursued under state common law or state statutory law.&nbsp; Thirty-one of the
fifty states provide some form of right of publicity protection. Eight states
provide both common law and statutory protection,<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[1]</span></span></span></a> thirteen states provide only
common law protection,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[2]</span></span></span></a>
and ten states provide only statutory protection.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[3]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; Because of their
importance to the entertainment and media industries, and because their
differences are typical of the differences among the laws of the many states, California
and New York�s schemes of publicity rights protection are detailed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But before delving into the specifics of the right of
publicity, it may be worthwhile to ask: why should we protect a person�s
identity from unauthorized commercial exploitation?&nbsp; Borrowing from
trademark law, should we do so simply to prevent false endorsements that may
mislead consumers as to who is actually endorsing a product?&nbsp; <i>See
generally</i> Stacey L. Dogan &amp; Mark A. Lemley, <i>What the Right of
Publicity Can Learn from Trademark Law</i>, 58 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Stan.
L. Rev</span>. 1161 (2006).&nbsp; Or are there further, independent
justifications?&nbsp; Some commentators have proposed moral or ethical rationales
for the right of publicity, based on an individual�s human right to privacy or on
an individual�s right to autonomous self-definition&#8212;so that a sportsmen
opposed to alcohol should not have to see his identity used to promote
alcoholic beverages.&nbsp; <i>But see O�Brien v. Pabst Sales Co</i>., 124 F.2d
167 (5th Cir. 1941) (denying football player Davy O�Brien�s privacy-based right
of publicity claim against a beer producer).&nbsp; Others have proposed a
Lockean justification for the right of publicity, in that the unauthorized
exploitation of someone�s identity constitutes a misappropriation of the fruits
of the labor of him who created that identity.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Michael Madow, <i>Private
Ownership of Public Image</i>, 81 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Cal. L.
Rev</span>. 127 (1993) (discussing but not endorsing this view).&nbsp;
Commentators have also proposed economic justifications for the right of
publicity, based on the proposition that the right of publicity provides an
economic incentive to celebrities to do more and better of whatever it is that
makes them celebrities, or that the right of publicity prevents �congestion
externalities,� i.e., the dilution of the distinctiveness of a celebrity�s
identity that might occur if that identity is associated with too many products
or services.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>William M.
Landes &amp; Richard A. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property
Law</span> 222-228 (2003).&nbsp; (In what sense is antidilution law essentially
a right of publicity scheme of protection for brand names?).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which of these rationales for the right of publicity strikes
you as the most or least persuasive?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

generally understood to be based on the individual�s right to privacy.&nbsp;
Accordingly, New York law does not provide for the descendibilty of the right
of publicity, which ceases in New York with the death of the individual.&nbsp;
By contrast, California�s statute, also excerpted below, is generally
understood to conceive of the right of publicity as a property right, which is
descendible for 70 years after the death of the individual. <span

Commentators routinely declare California�s right of publicity to be freely assignable,
while the New York case law has not clearly established the assignability of
the right in New York, but recent scholarship has suggested that the
alienability of the right of publicity is considerably more complicated across
the states.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Jennifer E. Rothman, <i>The Inalienable Right of

<p class=OpinionCitation>California Civil Code �� 3344 &amp; 3344.1. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>� 3344. Use of another's name, voice, signature, photograph,
or likeness for advertising or selling or soliciting purposes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) Any person who knowingly uses another's name, voice,
signature, photograph, or likeness, in any manner, on or in products,
merchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or soliciting
purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or services, without such person's
prior consent, or, in the case of a minor, the prior consent of his parent or
legal guardian, shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or
persons injured as a result thereof. In addition, in any action brought under
this section, the person who violated the section shall be liable to the
injured party or parties in an amount equal to the greater of seven hundred
fifty dollars ($750) or the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result
of the unauthorized use, and any profits from the unauthorized use that are
attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual
damages. In establishing such profits, the injured party or parties are
required to present proof only of the gross revenue attributable to such use,
and the person who violated this section is required to prove his or her
deductible expenses. Punitive damages may also be awarded to the injured party
or parties. The prevailing party in any action under this section shall also be
entitled to attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) As used in this section, �photograph� means any
photograph or photographic reproduction, still or moving, or any videotape or
live television transmission, of any person, such that the person is readily
identifiable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(1) A person shall be deemed to be
readily identifiable from a photograph when one who views the photograph with
the naked eye can reasonably determine that the person depicted in the
photograph is the same person who is complaining of its unauthorized use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(2) If the photograph includes more
than one person so identifiable, then the person or persons complaining of the
use shall be represented as individuals rather than solely as members of a
definable group represented in the photograph. A definable group includes, but
is not limited to, the following examples: a crowd at any sporting event, a
crowd in any street or public building, the audience at any theatrical or stage
production, a glee club, or a baseball team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(3) A person or persons shall be
considered to be represented as members of a definable group if they are
represented in the photograph solely as a result of being present at the time
the photograph was taken and have not been singled out as individuals in any
manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(c) Where a photograph or likeness of an employee of the
person using the photograph or likeness appearing in the advertisement or other
publication prepared by or in behalf of the user is only incidental, and not
essential, to the purpose of the publication in which it appears, there shall
arise a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence that
the failure to obtain the consent of the employee was not a knowing use of the
employee's photograph or likeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(d) For purposes of this section, a use of a name, voice,
signature, photograph, or likeness in connection with any news, public affairs,
or sports broadcast or account, or any political campaign, shall not constitute
a use for which consent is required under subdivision (a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(e) The use of a name, voice, signature, photograph, or
likeness in a commercial medium shall not constitute a use for which consent is
required under subdivision (a) solely because the material containing such use
is commercially sponsored or contains paid advertising. Rather it shall be a
question of fact whether or not the use of the person's name, voice, signature,
photograph, or likeness was so directly connected with the commercial
sponsorship or with the paid advertising as to constitute a use for which
consent is required under subdivision (a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(f) Nothing in this section shall apply to the owners or
employees of any medium used for advertising, including, but not limited to,
newspapers, magazines, radio and television networks and stations, cable
television systems, billboards, and transit ads, by whom any advertisement or
solicitation in violation of this section is published or disseminated, unless
it is established that such owners or employees had knowledge of the
unauthorized use of the person's name, voice, signature, photograph, or
likeness as prohibited by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(g) The remedies provided for in this section are cumulative
and shall be in addition to any others provided for by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>� 3344.1. Deceased personality's name, voice, signature,
photograph, or likeness; unauthorized use; damages and profits from use;
protected uses; persons entitled to exercise rights; successors in interest or
licensees; registration of claim</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a)(2) For purposes of this subdivision, a play, book,
magazine, newspaper, musical composition, audiovisual work, radio or television
program, single and original work of art, work of political or newsworthy
value, or an advertisement or commercial announcement for any of these works,
shall not be considered a product, article of merchandise, good, or service if
it is fictional or nonfictional entertainment, or a dramatic, literary, or
musical work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(j) For purposes of this section, the use of a name, voice,

<h2><a name="_Toc392010760">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right of Publicity
Case Law</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Provided below are opinions from two significant right of
publicity cases.&nbsp; The first, older case is <i>White v. Samsung Electronics
America, Inc</i>., 971 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1992), which addressed television
hostess Vanna White�s claims that a series of Samsung advertisement�s featuring
a robot likeness of her violated her intellectual property rights.&nbsp;
Excerpted below is the Ninth Circuit�s majority opinion in the case and Judge
Kozinski�s dissent from a denial of <i>en banc</i> review of that majority
opinion.&nbsp; The second case is of much more recent vintage and was issued on
the same day as <i>Brown v. Electronic Arts</i>, 724 F.3d 1235 (9th Cir. 2013),
which, you will recall from Part III.C.2 above, rejected retired football
player Jim Brown�s Lanham Act � 43(a) claim against a video game producer who
used his likeness in a video game.&nbsp; By contrast, in <i>In re NCAA
Student&#8211;Athlete Name &amp; Likeness Licensing Litigation</i>, 724 F.3d 1268
(9th Cir. 2013), the court addressed a California Civil Code � 3344 claim
against the video game producer brought by a one-time college football player.&nbsp;
As you will see, the California right of publicity claim was more successful
than Jim Brown�s Lanham Act � 43(a) claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you read through the <i>White v. Samsung</i> opinions,
consider the following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you are persuaded by the simple false endorsement
justification for right of publicity protection, then does <i>White v. Samsung</i>
support that justification?&nbsp; Does Samsung�s homage to Vanna White
constitute false endorsement?&nbsp; How might a court properly determine the
answer to this latter question?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In <i>Midler v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 849 F.2d 460 (9th Cir.1988)
and <i>Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc.,</i> 978 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir.1992), the
defendants employed impersonators to mimic the singing styles of Bette Midler
and Tom Waits, respectively, both of whom adamantly refuse to allow their art
to be used to sell goods and services.&nbsp; Defendants were found liable under
Lanham Act � 43(a) in both cases.&nbsp; If you are persuaded by Judge
Kozinski�s dissent, then how would you rule in <i>Midler</i> and <i>Waits</i>?</p>

<p class=MsoHeading7><a name="_Toc392010761">White v. Samsung Electronics
America, Inc.</a></p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>971 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1992)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>GOODWIN, Senior Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case involves a promotional �fame and fortune�
dispute. In running a particular advertisement without Vanna White's
permission, defendants Samsung Electronics America, Inc. (Samsung) and David
Deutsch Associates, Inc. (Deutsch) attempted to capitalize on White's fame to
enhance their fortune. White sued, alleging infringement of various intellectual
property rights, but the district court granted summary judgment in favor of
the defendants. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff Vanna White is the hostess of �Wheel of
Fortune,� one of the most popular game shows in television history. An
estimated forty million people watch the program daily. Capitalizing on the
fame which her participation in the show has bestowed on her, White markets her
identity to various advertisers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The dispute in this case arose out of a series of
advertisements prepared for Samsung by Deutsch. The series ran in at least half
a dozen publications with widespread, and in some cases national, circulation.
Each of the advertisements in the series followed the same theme. Each depicted
a current item from popular culture and a Samsung electronic product. Each was
set in the twenty-first century and conveyed the message that the Samsung product
would still be in use by that time. By hypothesizing outrageous future outcomes
for the cultural items, the ads created humorous effects. For example, one
lampooned current popular notions of an unhealthy diet by depicting a raw steak
with the caption: �Revealed to be health food. 2010 A.D.� Another depicted
irreverent �news�-show host Morton Downey Jr. in front of an American flag with
the caption: �Presidential candidate. 2008 A.D.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The advertisement which prompted the current
dispute was for Samsung video-cassette recorders (VCRs). The ad depicted a
robot, dressed in a wig, gown, and jewelry which Deutsch consciously selected
to resemble White's hair and dress. The robot was posed next to a game board
which is instantly recognizable as the Wheel of Fortune game show set, in a
stance for which White is famous. The caption of the ad read: �Longest-running
game show. 2012 A.D.� Defendants referred to the ad as the �Vanna White� ad.
Unlike the other celebrities used in the campaign, White neither consented to
the ads nor was she paid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Following the circulation of the robot ad, White
sued Samsung and Deutsch in federal district court under: (1) California Civil
Code � 3344; (2) the California common law right of publicity; and (3) � 43(a)
of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a). The district court granted summary
judgment against White on each of her claims. White now appeals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><b>I. Section 3344</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> White first argues that the district court erred in
rejecting her claim under section 3344. Section 3344(a) provides, in pertinent
part, that �[a]ny person who knowingly uses another's name, voice, signature,
photograph, or likeness, in any manner, ... for purposes of advertising or
selling, ... without such person's prior consent ... shall be liable for any
damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> White argues that the Samsung advertisement used
her �likeness� in contravention of section 3344. In <i>Midler v. Ford Motor
Co.,</i> 849 F.2d 460 (9th Cir.1988), this court rejected Bette Midler's
section 3344 claim concerning a Ford television commercial in which a Midler
�sound-alike� sang a song which Midler had made famous. In rejecting Midler's
claim, this court noted that �[t]he defendants did not use Midler's name or
anything else whose use is prohibited by the statute. The voice they used was
[another person's], not hers. The term �likeness' refers to a visual image not
a vocal imitation.� <i>Id.</i> at 463.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, Samsung and Deutsch used a robot with
mechanical features, and not, for example, a manikin molded to White's precise
features. Without deciding for all purposes when a caricature or
impressionistic resemblance might become a �likeness,� we agree with the
district court that the robot at issue here was not White's �likeness� within
the meaning of section 3344. Accordingly, we affirm the court's dismissal of
White's section 3344 claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><b>II. Right of Publicity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> White next argues that the district court erred in
granting summary judgment to defendants on White's common law right of
publicity claim. In <i>Eastwood v. Superior Court,</i> 149 Cal.App.3d 409, 198
Cal.Rptr. 342 (1983), the California court of appeal stated that the common law
right of publicity cause of action �may be pleaded by alleging (1) the
defendant's use of the plaintiff's identity; (2) the appropriation of
plaintiff's name or likeness to defendant's advantage, commercially or
otherwise; (3) lack of consent; and (4) resulting injury.� <i>Id.</i> at 417,
198 Cal.Rptr. 342 (citing Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) � 117, pp.
804&#8211;807). The district court dismissed White's claim for failure to
satisfy <i>Eastwood's</i> second prong, reasoning that defendants had not
appropriated White's �name or likeness� with their robot ad. We agree that the
robot ad did not make use of White's name or likeness. However, the common law
right of publicity is not so confined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Eastwood</i> court did not hold that the
right of publicity cause of action could be pleaded only by alleging an
appropriation of name or likeness. <i>Eastwood</i> involved an unauthorized use
of photographs of Clint Eastwood and of his name. Accordingly, the <i>Eastwood</i>
court had no occasion to consider the extent beyond the use of name or likeness
to which the right of publicity reaches. That court held only that the right of
publicity cause of action �may be� pleaded by alleging, <i>inter alia,</i>
appropriation of name or likeness, not that the action may be pleaded <i>only</i>
in those terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The �name or likeness� formulation referred to in <i>Eastwood</i>
originated not as an element of the right of publicity cause of action, but as
a description of the types of cases in which the cause of action had been
recognized. The source of this formulation is Prosser, <i>Privacy,</i> 48
Cal.L.Rev. 383, 401&#8211;07 (1960), one of the earliest and most enduring
articulations of the common law right of publicity cause of action. In looking
at the case law to that point, Prosser recognized that right of publicity cases
involved one of two basic factual scenarios: name appropriation, and picture or
other likeness appropriation. <i>Id.</i> at 401&#8211;02, nn. 156&#8211;57.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even though Prosser focused on appropriations of
name or likeness in discussing the right of publicity, he noted that �[i]t is
not impossible that there might be appropriation of the plaintiff's identity,
as by impersonation, without the use of either his name or his likeness, and
that this would be an invasion of his right of privacy.� <i>Id.</i> at 401, n.
155.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[4]</span></span></span></a> At the time Prosser wrote, he
noted however, that �[n]o such case appears to have arisen.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Since Prosser's early formulation, the case law has
borne out his insight that the right of publicity is not limited to the
appropriation of name or likeness. In <i>Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co.,</i> 498 F.2d 821 (9th Cir.1974), the defendant had used a
photograph of the plaintiff's race car in a television commercial. Although the
plaintiff appeared driving the car in the photograph, his features were not
visible. Even though the defendant had not appropriated the plaintiff's name or
likeness, this court held that plaintiff's California right of publicity claim
should reach the jury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Midler,</i> this court held that, even though
the defendants had not used Midler's name or likeness, Midler had stated a
claim for violation of her California common law right of publicity because
�the defendants ... for their own profit in selling their product did
appropriate part of her identity� by using a Midler sound-alike. <i>Id.</i> at
463&#8211;64.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets,
Inc.,</i> 698 F.2d 831 (6th Cir.1983), the defendant had marketed portable
toilets under the brand name �Here's Johnny�&#8212;Johnny Carson's signature
�Tonight Show� introduction&#8212;without Carson's permission. The district
court had dismissed Carson's Michigan common law right of publicity claim
because the defendants had not used Carson's �name or likeness.� <i>Id.</i> at
835. In reversing the district court, the sixth circuit found �the district
court's conception of the right of publicity ... too narrow� and held that the
right was implicated because the defendant had appropriated Carson's identity
by using, <i>inter alia,</i> the phrase �Here's Johnny.� <i>Id.</i> at
835&#8211;37.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These cases teach not only that the common law
right of publicity reaches means of appropriation other than name or likeness,
but that the specific means of appropriation are relevant only for determining
whether the defendant has in fact appropriated the plaintiff's identity. The
right of publicity does not require that appropriations of identity be
accomplished through particular means to be actionable. It is noteworthy that the
<i>Midler</i> and <i>Carson</i> defendants not only avoided using the
plaintiff's name or likeness, but they also avoided appropriating the
celebrity's voice, signature, and photograph. The photograph in <i>Motschenbacher</i>
did include the plaintiff, but because the plaintiff was not visible the driver
could have been an actor or dummy and the analysis in the case would have been
the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the defendants in these cases avoided the
most obvious means of appropriating the plaintiffs' identities, each of their
actions directly implicated the commercial interests which the right of
publicity is designed to protect. As the <i>Carson</i> court explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[t]he right of publicity has developed to protect the
commercial interest of celebrities in their identities. The theory of the right
is that a celebrity's identity can be valuable in the promotion of products,
and the celebrity has an interest that may be protected from the unauthorized
commercial exploitation of that identity.... If the celebrity's identity is
commercially exploited, there has been an invasion of his right whether or not
his �name or likeness� is used.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Carson,</i> 698 F.2d at 835. It is not important <i>how</i>
the defendant has appropriated the plaintiff's identity, but <i>whether</i> the
defendant has done so. <i>Motschenbacher, Midler,</i> and <i>Carson</i> teach
the impossibility of treating the right of publicity as guarding only against a
laundry list of specific means of appropriating identity. A rule which says
that the right of publicity can be infringed only through the use of nine
different methods of appropriating identity merely challenges the clever
advertising strategist to come up with the tenth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Indeed, if we treated the means of appropriation as
dispositive in our analysis of the right of publicity, we would not only weaken
the right but effectively eviscerate it. The right would fail to protect those
plaintiffs most in need of its protection. Advertisers use celebrities to
promote their products. The more popular the celebrity, the greater the number
of people who recognize her, and the greater the visibility for the product.
The identities of the most popular celebrities are not only the most attractive
for advertisers, but also the easiest to evoke without resorting to obvious
means such as name, likeness, or voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Consider a hypothetical advertisement which depicts
a mechanical robot with male features, an African&#8211;American complexion,
and a bald head. The robot is wearing black hightop Air Jordan basketball
sneakers, and a red basketball uniform with black trim, baggy shorts, and the
number 23 (though not revealing �Bulls� or �Jordan� lettering). The ad depicts
the robot dunking a basketball one-handed, stiff-armed, legs extended like open
scissors, and tongue hanging out. Now envision that this ad is run on
television during professional basketball games. Considered individually, the
robot's physical attributes, its dress, and its stance tell us little. Taken
together, they lead to the only conclusion that any sports viewer who has
registered a discernible pulse in the past five years would reach: the ad is
about Michael Jordan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Viewed separately, the individual aspects of the
advertisement in the present case say little. Viewed together, they leave
little doubt about the celebrity the ad is meant to depict. The female-shaped
robot is wearing a long gown, blond wig, and large jewelry. Vanna White dresses
exactly like this at times, but so do many other women. The robot is in the
process of turning a block letter on a game-board. Vanna White dresses like
this while turning letters on a game-board but perhaps similarly attired
Scrabble-playing women do this as well. The robot is standing on what looks to
be the Wheel of Fortune game show set. Vanna White dresses like this, turns
letters, and does this on the Wheel of Fortune game show. She is the only one.
Indeed, defendants themselves referred to their ad as the �Vanna White� ad. We
are not surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Television and other media create marketable
celebrity identity value. Considerable energy and ingenuity are expended by
those who have achieved celebrity value to exploit it for profit. The law
protects the celebrity's sole right to exploit this value whether the celebrity
has achieved her fame out of rare ability, dumb luck, or a combination thereof.
We decline Samsung and Deutch's invitation to permit the evisceration of the
common law right of publicity through means as facile as those in this case.
Because White has alleged facts showing that Samsung and Deutsch had
appropriated her identity, the district court erred by rejecting, on summary
judgment, White's common law right of publicity claim.</p>

<p class=Centered><b>III. The Lanham Act</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> White's final argument is that the district court
erred in denying her claim under � 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1125(a). The version of section 43(a) applicable to this case<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

that �[a]ny person who shall ... use, in connection with any goods or services
... any false description or representation ... shall be liable to a civil
action ... by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by
the use of any such false description or designation.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To prevail on her Lanham Act claim, White is
required to show that in running the robot ad, Samsung and Deutsch created a
likelihood of confusion, <i>Academy of Motion Picture Arts v. Creative House,</i>
944 F.2d 1446, 1454 (9th Cir.1991); <i>Toho Co. Ltd. v. Sears Roebuck &amp;
Co.,</i> 645 F.2d 788, 790 (9th Cir.1981) <i>New West Corp. v. NYM Co. of
California,</i> 595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir.1979), over whether White was
endorsing Samsung's VCRs. <i>HMH Publishing Co. v. Brincat,</i> 504 F.2d 713
(9th Cir.1974); <i>Allen v. National Video, Inc.,</i> 610 F.Supp. 612
(D.C.N.Y.1985).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This circuit recognizes several different
multi-factor tests for determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists. <i>See
Academy,</i> 944 F.2d at 1454, n. 3. None of these tests is correct to the
exclusion of the others. <i>Eclipse Associates Ltd. v. Data General Corp.,</i>
894 F.2d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir.1990). Normally, in reviewing the district court's
decision, this court will look to the particular test that the district court
used. <i>Academy,</i> 944 F.2d at 1454, n. 3; <i>Eclipse,</i> 894 F.2d at
1117&#8211;1118. However, because the district court in this case apparently
did not use any of the multi-factor tests in making its likelihood of confusion
determination, and because this case involves an appeal from summary judgment
and we review de novo the district court's determination, we will look for
guidance to the 8&#8211;factor test enunciated in <i>AMF, Inc. v. Sleekcraft
Boats,</i> 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.1979). According to <i>AMF,</i> factors
relevant to a likelihood of confusion include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(1) strength of the plaintiff's
mark;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(2) relatedness of the goods;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(3) similarity of the marks;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(4) evidence of actual confusion;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(5) marketing channels used;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(6) likely degree of purchaser
care;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(7) defendant's intent in selecting
the mark;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>(8) likelihood of expansion of the
product lines.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>599 F.2d at 348&#8211;49. We turn now to consider
White's claim in light of each factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In cases involving confusion over endorsement by a
celebrity plaintiff, �mark� means the celebrity's persona. <i>See Allen,</i>
610 F.Supp. at 627. The �strength� of the mark refers to the level of
recognition the celebrity enjoys among members of society. <i>See Academy,</i>
944 F.2d at 1455. If Vanna White is unknown to the segment of the public at
whom Samsung's robot ad was directed, then that segment could not be confused
as to whether she was endorsing Samsung VCRs. Conversely, if White is
well-known, this would allow the possibility of a likelihood of confusion. For
the purposes of the <i>Sleekcraft</i> test, White's �mark,� or celebrity
identity, is strong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In cases concerning confusion over celebrity
endorsement, the plaintiff's �goods� concern the reasons for or source of the
plaintiff's fame. Because White's fame is based on her televised performances,
her �goods� are closely related to Samsung's VCRs. Indeed, the ad itself
reinforced the relationship by informing its readers that they would be taping
the �longest-running game show� on Samsung's VCRs well into the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The third factor, �similarity of the marks,� both
supports and contradicts a finding of likelihood of confusion. On the one hand,
all of the aspects of the robot ad identify White; on the other, the figure is
quite clearly a robot, not a human. This ambiguity means that we must look to
the other factors for resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fourth factor does not favor White's claim
because she has presented no evidence of actual confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Fifth, however, White has appeared in the same
stance as the robot from the ad in numerous magazines, including the covers of
some. Magazines were used as the marketing channels for the robot ad. This
factor cuts toward a likelihood of confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Sixth, consumers are not likely to be particularly
careful in determining who endorses VCRs, making confusion as to their
endorsement more likely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Concerning the seventh factor, �defendant's
intent,� the district court found that, in running the robot ad, the defendants
had intended a spoof of the �Wheel of Fortune.� The relevant question is
whether the defendants �intended to profit by confusing consumers� concerning
the endorsement of Samsung VCRs. <i>Toho,</i> 645 F.2d 788. We do not disagree
that defendants intended to spoof Vanna White and �Wheel of Fortune.� That does
not preclude, however, the possibility that defendants also intended to confuse
consumers regarding endorsement. The robot ad was one of a series of ads run by
defendants which followed the same theme. Another ad in the series depicted
Morton Downey Jr. as a presidential candidate in the year 2008. Doubtless,
defendants intended to spoof presidential elections and Mr. Downey through this
ad. Consumers, however, would likely believe, and would be correct in so
believing, that Mr. Downey was paid for his permission and was endorsing
Samsung products. Looking at the series of advertisements as a whole, a jury
could reasonably conclude that beneath the surface humor of the series lay an
intent to persuade consumers that celebrity Vanna White, like celebrity Downey,
was endorsing Samsung products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, the eighth factor, �likelihood of expansion
of the product lines,� does not appear apposite to a celebrity endorsement case
such as this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Application of the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors to
this case indicates that the district court erred in rejecting White's Lanham
Act claim at the summary judgment stage. In so concluding, we emphasize two
facts, however. First, construing the motion papers in White's favor, as we
must, we hold only that White has raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning
a likelihood of confusion as to her endorsement. <i>Cohen v. Paramount Pictures
Corp.,</i> 845 F.2d 851, 852&#8211;53 (9th Cir.1988). Whether White's Lanham
Act claim should succeed is a matter for the jury. Second, we stress that we
reach this conclusion in light of the peculiar facts of this case. In
particular, we note that the robot ad identifies White and was part of a series
of ads in which other celebrities participated and were paid for their
endorsement of Samsung's products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><b>IV. The Parody Defense</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In defense, defendants cite a number of cases for
the proposition that their robot ad constituted protected speech. The only
cases they cite which are even remotely relevant to this case are <i>Hustler Magazine
v. Falwell,</i> 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988) and <i>L.L.
Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc.,</i> 811 F.2d 26 (1st Cir.1987). Those
cases involved parodies of advertisements run for the purpose of poking fun at
Jerry Falwell and L.L. Bean, respectively. This case involves a true
advertisement run for the purpose of selling Samsung VCRs. The ad's spoof of
Vanna White and Wheel of Fortune is subservient and only tangentially related
to the ad's primary message: �buy Samsung VCRs.� Defendants' parody arguments
are better addressed to non-commercial parodies.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[6]</span></span></span></a>
The difference between a �parody� and a �knock-off� is the difference between
fun and profit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, for celebrity exploitation advertising to be
effective, the advertisement must evoke the celebrity's identity. The more
effective the evocation, the better the advertisement. If, as Samsung claims,
its ad was based on a �generic� game-show hostess and not on Vanna White, the
ad would not have violated anyone's right of publicity, but it would also not
have been as humorous or as effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, even if some forms of expressive activity,
such as parody, do rely on identity evocation, the first amendment hurdle will
bar most right of publicity actions against those activities. <i>Cf. Falwell,</i>
485 U.S. at 46, 108 S.Ct. at 876. In the case of commercial advertising,
however, the first amendment hurdle is not so high. <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp;
Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York,</i> 447 U.S. 557, 566, 100
S.Ct. 2343, 2351, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). Realizing this, Samsung attempts to
elevate its ad above the status of garden-variety commercial speech by pointing
to the ad's parody of Vanna White. Samsung's argument is unavailing. <i>See
Board of Trustees, State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox,</i> 492 U.S. 469, 474&#8211;75,
109 S.Ct. 3028, 3031, 106 L.Ed.2d 388 (1988); <i>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products
Corp.,</i> 463 U.S. 60, 67&#8211;68, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 2880&#8211;81, 77 L.Ed.2d
469 (1983). Unless the first amendment bars all right of publicity
actions&#8212;and it does not, <i>see Zachini v. Scripps&#8211;Howard
Broadcasting Co.,</i> 433 U.S. 562, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 53 L.Ed.2d 965
(1977)&#8212;then it does not bar this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Something very dangerous is going on here. Private
property, including intellectual property, is essential to our way of life. It
provides an incentive for investment and innovation; it stimulates the
flourishing of our culture; it protects the moral entitlements of people to the
fruits of their labors. But reducing too much to private property can be bad
medicine. Private land, for instance, is far more useful if separated from
other private land by public streets, roads and highways. Public parks, utility
rights-of-way and sewers reduce the amount of land in private hands, but vastly
enhance the value of the property that remains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> So too it is with intellectual property.
Overprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it.
Creativity is impossible without a rich public domain. Nothing today, likely
nothing since we tamed fire, is genuinely new: Culture, like science and
technology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those
who came before. Overprotection stifles the very creative forces it's supposed
to nurture.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span

Concerned about what it sees as a wrong done to Vanna White, the panel majority
erects a property right of remarkable and dangerous breadth: Under the
majority's opinion, it's now a tort for advertisers to <i>remind</i> the public
of a celebrity. Not to use a celebrity's name, voice, signature or likeness;
not to imply the celebrity endorses a product; but simply to evoke the
celebrity's image in the public's mind. This Orwellian notion withdraws far
more from the public domain than prudence and common sense allow. It conflicts
with the Copyright Act and the Copyright Clause. It raises serious First
Amendment problems. It's bad law, and it deserves a long, hard second look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Samsung ran an ad campaign promoting its consumer
electronics. Each ad depicted a Samsung product and a humorous prediction: One
showed a raw steak with the caption �Revealed to be health food. 2010 A.D.�
Another showed Morton Downey, Jr. in front of an American flag with the caption
�Presidential candidate. 2008 A.D.�<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[18]</span></span></span></a>
The ads were meant to convey&#8212;humorously&#8212;that Samsung products would
still be in use twenty years from now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The ad that spawned this litigation starred a robot
dressed in a wig, gown and jewelry reminiscent of Vanna White's hair and dress;
the robot was posed next to a Wheel-of-Fortune-like game board. <i>See</i>
Appendix. The caption read �Longest-running game show. 2012 A.D.� The gag here,
I take it, was that Samsung would still be around when White had been replaced
by a robot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Perhaps failing to see the humor, White sued,
alleging Samsung infringed her right of publicity by �appropriating� her �identity.�
Under California law, White has the exclusive right to use her name, likeness,
signature and voice for commercial purposes. Cal.Civ.Code � 3344(a); <i>Eastwood
v. Superior Court,</i> 149 Cal.App.3d 409, 417, 198 Cal.Rptr. 342, 347 (1983).
But Samsung didn't use her name, voice or signature, and it certainly didn't
use her likeness. The ad just wouldn't have been funny had it depicted White or
someone who resembled her&#8212;the whole joke was that the game show host(ess)
was a robot, not a real person. No one seeing the ad could have thought this
was supposed to be White in 2012.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district judge quite reasonably held that,
because Samsung didn't use White's name, likeness, voice or signature, it didn't
violate her right of publicity. 971 F.2d at 1396-97. Not so, says the panel
majority: The California right of publicity can't possibly be limited to name
and likeness. If it were, the majority reasons, a �clever advertising
strategist� could avoid using White's name or likeness but nevertheless remind
people of her with impunity, �effectively eviscerat[ing]� her rights. To
prevent this �evisceration,� the panel majority holds that the right of
publicity must extend beyond name and likeness, to any �appropriation� of
White's �identity�&#8212;anything that �evoke[s]� her personality. <i>Id.</i>
at 1398-99.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But what does �evisceration� mean in intellectual
property law? Intellectual property rights aren't like some constitutional
rights, absolute guarantees protected against all kinds of interference, subtle
as well as blatant.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[19]</span></span></span></a>
They cast no penumbras, emit no emanations: The very point of intellectual
property laws is that they protect only against certain specific kinds of
appropriation. I can't publish unauthorized copies of, say, <i>Presumed
Innocent;</i> I can't make a movie out of it. But I'm perfectly free to write a
book about an idealistic young prosecutor on trial for a crime he didn't
commit.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[20]</span></span></span></a>
So what if I got the idea from <i>Presumed Innocent?</i> So what if it reminds
readers of the original? Have I �eviscerated� Scott Turow's intellectual
property rights? Certainly not. All creators draw in part on the work of those
who came before, referring to it, building on it, poking fun at it; we call
this creativity, not piracy.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span

style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority isn't, in fact, preventing the
�evisceration� of Vanna White's existing rights; it's creating a new and much
broader property right, a right unknown in California law.<a href="#_ftn22"

font-family:Cambria'>[22]</span></span></span></a> It's replacing the existing
balance between the interests of the celebrity and those of the public by a
different balance, one substantially more favorable to the celebrity. Instead
of having an exclusive right in her name, likeness, signature or voice, every
famous person now has an exclusive right to <i>anything that reminds the viewer
of her.</i> After all, that's all Samsung did: It used an inanimate object to
remind people of White, to �evoke [her identity].� 971 F.2d at 1399.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Consider how sweeping this new right is. What is it
about the ad that makes people think of White? It's not the robot's wig,
clothes or jewelry; there must be ten million blond women (many of them
quasi-famous) who wear dresses and jewelry like White's. It's that the robot is
posed near the �Wheel of Fortune� game board. Remove the game board from the
ad, and no one would think of Vanna White. <i>See</i> Appendix. But once you
include the game board, anybody standing beside it-a brunette woman, a man
wearing women's clothes, a monkey in a wig and gown-would evoke White's image,
precisely the way the robot did. It's the �Wheel of Fortune� set, not the
robot's face or dress or jewelry that evokes White's image. The panel is giving
White an exclusive right not in what she looks like or who she is, but in what
she does for a living.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This is entirely the wrong place to strike the
balance. Intellectual property rights aren't free: They're imposed at the
expense of future creators and of the public at large. Where would we be if
Charles Lindbergh had an exclusive right in the concept of a heroic solo
aviator? If Arthur Conan Doyle had gotten a copyright in the idea of the
detective story, or Albert Einstein had patented the theory of relativity? If
every author and celebrity had been given the right to keep people from mocking
them or their work? Surely this would have made the world poorer, not richer,
culturally as well as economically.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This is why intellectual property law is full of
careful balances between what's set aside for the owner and what's left in the
public domain for the rest of us: The relatively short life of patents; the
longer, but finite, life of copyrights; copyright's idea-expression dichotomy;
the fair use doctrine; the prohibition on copyrighting facts; the compulsory
license of television broadcasts and musical compositions; federal preemption
of overbroad state intellectual property laws; the nominative use doctrine in
trademark law; the right to make soundalike recordings.<a href="#_ftn26"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[26]</span></span></span></a> All of these diminish an
intellectual property owner's rights. All let the public use something created
by someone else. But all are necessary to maintain a free environment in which
creative genius can flourish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The intellectual property right created by the
panel here has none of these essential limitations: No fair use exception; no
right to parody; no idea-expression dichotomy. It impoverishes the public
domain, to the detriment of future creators and the public at large. Instead of
well-defined, limited characteristics such as name, likeness or voice,
advertisers will now have to cope with vague claims of �appropriation of
identity,� claims often made by people with a wholly exaggerated sense of their
own fame and significance. <i>See</i> pp. 1512-13 &amp; notes 1-10 <i>supra.</i>
Future Vanna Whites might not get the chance to create their personae, because
their employers may fear some celebrity will claim the persona is too similar
to her own.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span

The public will be robbed of parodies of celebrities, and our culture will be
deprived of the valuable safety valve that parody and mockery create.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, consider the moral dimension, about which
the panel majority seems to have gotten so exercised. Saying Samsung
�appropriated� something of White's begs the question: <i>Should</i> White have
the exclusive right to something as broad and amorphous as her �identity�?
Samsung's ad didn't simply copy White's schtick-like all parody, it created
something new.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[28]</span></span></span></a>
True, Samsung did it to make money, but White does whatever she does to make
money, too; the majority talks of �the difference between fun and profit,� 971
F.2d at 1401, but in the entertainment industry fun <i>is</i> profit. Why is
Vanna White's right to exclusive for-profit use of her persona&#8212;a persona
that might not even be her own creation, but that of a writer, director or
producer&#8212;superior to Samsung's right to profit by creating its own
inventions? Why should she have such absolute rights to control the conduct of
others, unlimited by the idea-expression dichotomy or by the fair use doctrine?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To paraphrase only slightly <i>Feist Publications,
Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,</i> 499 U.S. 340 (1991), it may seem
unfair that much of the fruit of a creator's labor may be used by others
without compensation. But this is not some unforeseen byproduct of our
intellectual property system; it is the system's very essence. Intellectual
property law assures authors the right to their original expression, but
encourages others to build freely on the ideas that underlie it. This result is
neither unfair nor unfortunate: It is the means by which intellectual property
law advances the progress of science and art. We give authors certain exclusive
rights, but in exchange we get a richer public domain. The majority ignores
this wise teaching, and all of us are the poorer for it.<a href="#_ftn29"

<p class=CenteredBold>IV</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The panel, however, does more than misinterpret
California law: By refusing to recognize a parody exception to the right of
publicity, the panel directly contradicts the federal Copyright Act. Samsung
didn't merely parody Vanna White. It parodied Vanna White appearing in �Wheel
of Fortune,� a copyrighted television show, and parodies of copyrighted works
are governed by federal copyright law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Copyright law specifically gives the world at large
the right to make �fair use� parodies, parodies that don't borrow too much of
the original. <i>Fisher v. Dees,</i> 794 F.2d 432, 435 (9th Cir.1986).�</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>VI</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, I can't see how giving White the power to
keep others from evoking her image in the public's mind can be squared with the
First Amendment. Where does White get this right to control our thoughts? The
majority's creation goes way beyond the protection given a trademark or a
copyrighted work, or a person's name or likeness. All those things control one particular
way of expressing an idea, one way of referring to an object or a person. But
not allowing <i>any</i> means of reminding people of someone? That's a speech
restriction unparalleled in First Amendment law.<a href="#_ftn30"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> What's more, I doubt even a name-and-likeness-only
right of publicity can stand without a parody exception. The First Amendment
isn't just about religion or politics&#8212;it's also about protecting the free
development of our national culture. Parody, humor, irreverence are all vital
components of the marketplace of ideas. The last thing we need, the last thing
the First Amendment will tolerate, is a law that lets public figures keep
people from mocking them, or from �evok[ing]� their images in the mind of the
public. 971 F.2d at 1399.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority dismisses the First Amendment issue
out of hand because Samsung's ad was commercial speech. <i>Id.</i> at 1401
&amp; n. 3. So what? Commercial speech may be less protected by the First
Amendment than noncommercial speech, but less protected means protected
nonetheless. <i>CentralHudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n,</i>
447 U.S. 557, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). And there are very good
reasons for this. Commercial speech has a profound effect on our culture and
our attitudes. Neutral-seeming ads influence people's social and political
attitudes, and themselves arouse political controversy.<a href="#_ftn32"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In our pop culture, where salesmanship must be
entertaining and entertainment must sell, the line between the commercial and
noncommercial has not merely blurred; it has disappeared. Is the Samsung parody
any different from a parody on Saturday Night Live or in Spy Magazine? Both are
equally profit-motivated. Both use a celebrity's identity to sell things&#8212;one
to sell VCRs, the other to sell advertising. Both mock their subjects. Both try
to make people laugh. Both add something, perhaps something worthwhile and
memorable, perhaps not, to our culture. Both are things that the people being
portrayed might dearly want to suppress. <i>See</i> notes 1 &amp; 29 <i>supra.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Commercial speech is a significant, valuable part
of our national discourse. The Supreme Court has recognized as much, and has
insisted that lower courts carefully scrutinize commercial speech restrictions,
but the panel totally fails to do this. The panel majority doesn't even purport
to apply the <i>Central Hudson</i> test, which the Supreme Court devised
specifically for determining whether a commercial speech restriction is valid.<a
href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[35]</span></span></span></a> The majority doesn't ask, as
<i>Central Hudson</i> requires, whether the speech restriction is justified by
a substantial state interest. It doesn't ask whether the restriction directly
advances the interest. It doesn't ask whether the restriction is narrowly
tailored to the interest. <i>See id.</i> at 566.<a href="#_ftn36"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Process matters. The Supreme Court didn't set out
the <i>Central Hudson</i> test for its health. It devised the test because it
saw lower courts were giving the First Amendment short shrift when confronted
with commercial speech. <i>See Central Hudson,</i> 447 U.S. at 561-62, 567-68,
100 S.Ct. at 2348-49, 2352. The <i>Central Hudson</i> test was an attempt to
constrain lower courts' discretion, to focus judges' thinking on the important issues&#8212;how
strong the state interest is, how broad the regulation is, whether a narrower
regulation would work just as well. If the Court wanted to leave these matters
to judges' gut feelings, to nifty lines about �the difference between fun and
profit,� 971 F.2d at 1401, it could have done so with much less effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Maybe applying the test would have convinced the
majority to change its mind; maybe going through the factors would have shown
that its rule was too broad, or the reasons for protecting White's �identity�
too tenuous. Maybe not. But we shouldn't thumb our nose at the Supreme Court by
just refusing to apply its test.</p>

Appeals for the Hollywood Circuit. Millions of people toil in the shadow of the
law we make, and much of their livelihood is made possible by the existence of
intellectual property rights. But much of their livelihood&#8212;and much of
the vibrancy of our culture&#8212;also depends on the existence of other

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Video games are entitled to the full protections of
the First Amendment, because �[l]ike the protected books, plays, and movies
that preceded them, video games communicate ideas&#8212;and even social
messages&#8212;through many familiar literary devices (such as characters,
dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such
as the player's interaction with the virtual world).� <i>Brown v. Entm't

Such rights are not absolute, and states may recognize the right of publicity
to a degree consistent with the First Amendment. <i>Zacchini v.
Scripps&#8211;Howard Broad. Co.,</i> 433 U.S. 562, 574&#8211;75, 97 S.Ct. 2849,
53 L.Ed.2d 965 (1977). In this case, we must balance the right of publicity of
a former college football player against the asserted First Amendment right of
a video game developer to use his likeness in its expressive works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court concluded that the game
developer, Electronic Arts (�EA�), had no First Amendment defense against the
right-of-publicity claims of the football player, Samuel Keller. We affirm.
Under the �transformative use� test developed by the California Supreme Court,
EA's use does not qualify for First Amendment protection as a matter of law
because it literally recreates Keller in the very setting in which he has
achieved renown. The other First Amendment defenses asserted by EA do not
defeat Keller's claims either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Samuel Keller was the starting quarterback for
Arizona State University in 2005 before he transferred to the University of
Nebraska, where he played during the 2007 season. EA is the producer of the <i>NCAA
Football</i> series of video games, which allow users to control avatars
representing college football players as those avatars participate in simulated
games. In <i>NCAA Football,</i> EA seeks to replicate each school's entire team
as accurately as possible. Every real football player on each team included in
the game has a corresponding avatar in the game with the player's actual jersey
number and virtually identical height, weight, build, skin tone, hair color,
and home state. EA attempts to match any unique, highly identifiable playing
behaviors by sending detailed questionnaires to team equipment managers.
Additionally, EA creates realistic virtual versions of actual stadiums;
populates them with the virtual athletes, coaches, cheerleaders, and fans
realistically rendered by EA's graphic artists; and incorporates realistic
sounds such as the crunch of the players' pads and the roar of the crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> EA's game differs from reality in that EA omits the
players' names on their jerseys and assigns each player a home town that is
different from the actual player's home town. However, users of the video game
may upload rosters of names obtained from third parties so that the names do
appear on the jerseys. In such cases, EA allows images from the game containing
athletes' real names to be posted on its website by users. Users can further
alter reality by entering �Dynasty� mode, where the user assumes a head coach's
responsibilities for a college program for up to thirty seasons, including
recruiting players from a randomly generated pool of high school athletes, or
�Campus Legend� mode, where the user controls a virtual player from high school
through college, making choices relating to practices, academics, and social
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the 2005 edition of the game, the virtual
starting quarterback for Arizona State wears number 9, as did Keller, and has
the same height, weight, skin tone, hair color, hair style, handedness, home
state, play style (pocket passer), visor preference, facial features, and
school year as Keller. In the 2008 edition, the virtual quarterback for
Nebraska has these same characteristics, though the jersey number does not
match, presumably because Keller changed his number right before the season
started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Objecting to this use of his likeness, Keller filed
a putative class-action complaint in the Northern District of California
asserting, as relevant on appeal, that EA violated his right of publicity under
California Civil Code � 3344 and California common law.<a href="#_ftn40"

complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (�SLAPP�) under
California's anti-SLAPP statute, Cal.Civ.Proc.Code � 425.16, and the district
court denied the motion. We have jurisdiction over EA's appeal pursuant to 28
U.S.C. � 1291. <i>See Batzel v. Smith,</i> 333 F.3d 1018, 1024&#8211;26 (9th

that the anti-SLAPP statute is available in federal court. <i>Thomas v. Fry's

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span

First, the defendant must �make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff's suit
arises from an act by the defendant made in connection with a public issue in
furtherance of the defendant's right to free speech under the United States or
California Constitution.� <i>Batzel,</i> 333 F.3d at 1024. Keller does not
contest that EA has made this threshold showing. Indeed, there is no question
that �video games qualify for First Amendment protection,� <i>Entm't Merchs.
Ass'n,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2733, or that Keller's suit arises from EA's production
and distribution of <i>NCAA Football</i> in furtherance of EA's protected right
to express itself through video games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, we must evaluate whether the plaintiff has
�establish[ed] a reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail on his
or her ... claim.� <i>Batzel,</i> 333 F.3d at 1024. �The plaintiff must
demonstrate that the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a prima
facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence
submitted by plaintiff is credited.� <i>Metabolife Int'l, Inc. v. Wornick,</i>
264 F.3d 832, 840 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
statute �subjects to potential dismissal only those actions in which the
plaintiff cannot state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.� <i>Navellier
v. Sletten,</i> 29 Cal.4th 82, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703, 711 (2002)
(internal quotation marks omitted). EA did not contest before the district
court and does not contest here that Keller has stated a right-of-publicity
claim under California common and statutory law.<a href="#_ftn42"

affirmative defenses derived from the First Amendment: the �transformative use�
test, the <i>Rogers</i> test, the �public interest� test, and the �public
affairs� exemption. EA argues that, in light of these defenses, it is not
reasonably probable that Keller will prevail on his right-of-publicity claim.

transformative use defense in <i>Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup,
Inc.,</i> 25 Cal.4th 387, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d 797 (2001). The defense
is �a balancing test between the First Amendment and the right of publicity
based on whether the work in question adds significant creative elements so as
to be transformed into something more than a mere celebrity likeness or
imitation.� <i>Id.</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 799. The California
Supreme Court explained that �when a work contains significant transformative
elements, it is not only especially worthy of First Amendment protection, but
it is also less likely to interfere with the economic interest protected by the
right of publicity.� <i>Id.</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 808. The court
rejected the wholesale importation of the copyright �fair use� defense into
right-of-publicity claims, but recognized that some aspects of that defense are
�particularly pertinent.� <i>Id.; see</i> 17 U.S.C. � 107; <i>see also SOFA
Entm't, Inc. v. Dodger Prods., Inc.,</i> 709 F.3d 1273, 1277&#8211;78 (9th

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Comedy III</i> gives us at least five factors to
consider in determining whether a work is sufficiently transformative to obtain
First Amendment protection. <i>See</i> J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>The Rights of
Publicity and Privacy</i> � 8:72 (2d ed.2012). First, if �the celebrity
likeness is one of the �raw materials' from which an original work is
synthesized,� it is more likely to be transformative than if �the depiction or
imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in
question.� <i>Comedy III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 809. Second, the
work is protected if it is �primarily the defendant's own expression�&#8212;as
long as that expression is �something other than the likeness of the
celebrity.� <i>Id.</i> This factor requires an examination of whether a likely
purchaser's primary motivation is to buy a reproduction of the celebrity, or to
buy the expressive work of that artist. McCarthy, <i>supra,</i> � 8:72. Third,
to avoid making judgments concerning �the quality of the artistic
contribution,� a court should conduct an inquiry �more quantitative than
qualitative� and ask �whether the literal and imitative or the creative
elements predominate in the work.� <i>Comedy III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21
P.3d at 809. Fourth, the California Supreme Court indicated that �a subsidiary
inquiry� would be useful in close cases: whether �the marketability and
economic value of the challenged work derive primarily from the fame of the
celebrity depicted.� <i>Id.</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 810. Lastly,
the court indicated that �when an artist's skill and talent is manifestly
subordinated to the overall goal of creating a conventional portrait of a
celebrity so as to commercially exploit his or her fame,� the work is not
transformative. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have explained that �[o]nly if [a defendant] is
entitled to the [transformative] defense <i>as a matter of law</i> can it
prevail on its motion to strike,� because the California Supreme Court
�envisioned the application of the defense as a question of fact.� <i>Hilton,</i>
599 F.3d at 910. As a result, EA �is only entitled to the defense as a matter
of law if no trier of fact could reasonably conclude that the [game] [i]s not
transformative.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> California courts have applied the transformative
use test in relevant situations in four cases. First, in <i>Comedy III</i>
itself, the California Supreme Court applied the test to T-shirts and
lithographs bearing a likeness of The Three Stooges and concluded that it could
�discern no significant transformative or creative contribution.� <i>Id.</i>
106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 811. The court reasoned that the artist's
�undeniable skill is manifestly subordinated to the overall goal of creating
literal, conventional depictions of The Three Stooges so as to exploit their
fame.� <i>Id.</i> �[W]ere we to decide that [the artist's] depictions were
protected by the First Amendment,� the court continued, �we cannot perceive how
the right of publicity would remain a viable right other than in cases of
falsified celebrity endorsements.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, in <i>Winter v. DC Comics,</i> the
California Supreme Court applied the test to comic books containing characters
Johnny and Edgar Autumn, �depicted as villainous half-worm, half-human
offspring� but evoking two famous brothers, rockers Johnny and Edgar Winter. 30
Cal.4th 881, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 P.3d 473, 476 (2003). [<i>See relevant
images below</i>].&nbsp; The court held that �the comic books are
transformative and entitled to First Amendment protection.� <i>Id.</i> 134
Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 P.3d at 480. It reasoned that the comic books �are not just
conventional depictions of plaintiffs but contain significant expressive
content other than plaintiffs' mere likenesses.� <i>Id.</i> 134 Cal.Rptr.2d
634, 69 P.3d at 479. �To the extent the drawings of the Autumn brothers
resemble plaintiffs at all, they are distorted for purposes of lampoon, parody,
or caricature.� <i>Id.</i> Importantly, the court relied on the fact that the
brothers �are but cartoon characters ... in a larger story, which is itself
quite expressive.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Third, in <i>Kirby v. Sega of America, Inc.,</i>
the California Court of Appeal applied the transformative use test to a video
game in which the user controls the dancing of �Ulala,� a reporter from outer
space allegedly based on singer Kierin Kirby, whose � �signature� lyrical
expression ... is �ooh la la.� � 144 Cal.App.4th 47, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607,
609&#8211;10 (2006). [<i>See relevant images below</i>]. The court held that
�Ulala is more than a mere likeness or literal depiction of Kirby,� pointing to
Ulala's �extremely tall, slender computer-generated physique,� her �hairstyle
and primary costume,� her dance moves, and her role as �a space-age reporter in
the 25th century,� all of which were �unlike any public depiction of Kirby.� <i>Id.</i>
at 616. �As in <i>Winter,</i> Ulala is a �fanciful, creative character� who
exists in the context of a unique and expressive video game.� <i>Id.</i> at
618.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, in <i>No Doubt v. Activision Publishing,
Inc.,</i> the California Court of Appeal addressed Activision's <i>Band Hero</i>
video game. 192 Cal.App.4th 1018, 122 Cal.Rptr.3d 397, 400 (2011), <i>petition
for review denied,</i> 2011 Cal. LEXIS 6100 (Cal. June 8, 2011) (No. B223996).&nbsp;
[<i>See relevant images below</i>].&nbsp; In <i>Band Hero,</i> users simulate
performing in a rock band in time with popular songs. <i>Id.</i> at 401. Users
choose from a number of avatars, some of which represent actual rock stars,
including the members of the rock band No Doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 401. Activision
licensed No Doubt's likeness, but allegedly exceeded the scope of the license
by permitting users to manipulate the No Doubt avatars to play any song in the
game, solo or with members of other bands, and even to alter the avatars'
voices. <i>Id.</i> at 402. The court held that No Doubt's right of publicity
prevailed despite Activision's First Amendment defense because the game was not
�transformative� under the <i>Comedy III</i> test. It reasoned that the video
game characters were �literal recreations of the band members,� doing �the same
activity by which the band achieved and maintains its fame.� <i>Id.</i> at 411.
According to the court, the fact �that the avatars appear in the context of a
videogame that contains many other creative elements[ ] does not transform the
avatars into anything other than exact depictions of No Doubt's members doing
exactly what they do as celebrities.� <i>Id.</i> The court concluded that �the
expressive elements of the game remain manifestly subordinated to the overall
goal of creating a conventional portrait of No Doubt so as to commercially
exploit its fame.� <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have also had occasion to apply the
transformative use test. In <i>Hilton v. Hallmark Cards,</i> we applied the
test to a birthday card depicting Paris Hilton in a manner reminiscent of an
episode of Hilton's reality show <i>The Simple Life.</i> 599 F.3d at 899. [<i>See
relevant image below</i>].&nbsp; We observed some differences between the
episode and the card, but noted that �the basic setting is the same: we see
Paris Hilton, born to privilege, working as a waitress.� <i>Id.</i> at 911. We
reasoned that �[w]hen we compare Hallmark's card to the video game in <i>Kirby,</i>
which transported a 1990s singer (catchphrases and all) into the 25th century
and transmogrified her into a space-age reporter, ... the card falls far short
of the level of new expression added in the video game.� <i>Id.</i> As a
result, we concluded that �there is enough doubt as to whether Hallmark's card
is transformative under our case law that we cannot say Hallmark is entitled to
the defense as a matter of law.� <i>Id.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With these cases in mind as guidance, we conclude
that EA's use of Keller's likeness does not contain significant transformative
elements such that EA is entitled to the defense as a matter of law. The facts
of <i>No Doubt</i> are very similar to those here. EA is alleged to have
replicated Keller's physical characteristics in <i>NCAA Football,</i> just as
the members of No Doubt are realistically portrayed in <i>Band Hero.</i> Here,
as in <i>Band Hero,</i> users manipulate the characters in the performance of
the same activity for which they are known in real life&#8212;playing football
in this case, and performing in a rock band in <i>Band Hero.</i> The context in
which the activity occurs is also similarly realistic&#8212;real venues in <i>Band
Hero</i> and realistic depictions of actual football stadiums in <i>NCAA
Football.</i> As the district court found, Keller is represented as �what he
was: the starting quarterback for Arizona State� and Nebraska, and �the game's
setting is identical to where the public found [Keller] during his collegiate
career: on the football field.� <i>Keller v. Elec. Arts, Inc.,</i> No. C
09&#8211;1967 CW, 2010 WL 530108, at *5 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 8, 2010).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> EA argues that the district court erred in focusing
primarily on Keller's likeness and ignoring the transformative elements of the
game as a whole. Judge Thomas, our dissenting colleague, suggests the same. <i>See</i>
Dissent at 1285. We are unable to say that there was any error, particularly in
light of <i>No Doubt</i>, which reasoned much the same as the district court in
this case: �that the avatars appear in the context of a videogame that contains
many other creative elements[ ] does not transform the avatars into anything
other than exact depictions of No Doubt's members doing exactly what they do as
celebrities.� <i>No Doubt,</i> 122 Cal.Rptr.3d at 411.<a href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[45]</span></span></span></a> EA suggests that the fact
that <i>NCAA Football</i> users can alter the characteristics of the avatars in
the game is significant. Again, our dissenting colleague agrees. <i>See</i>
Dissent at 1286&#8211;87. In <i>No Doubt,</i> the California Court of Appeal
noted that <i>Band Hero</i> �d[id] not permit players to alter the No Doubt
avatars in any respect.� <i>Id.</i> at 410. The court went on to say that the
No Doubt avatars �remain at all times immutable images of the real celebrity
musicians, in stark contrast to the �fanciful, creative characters' in <i>Winter</i>
and <i>Kirby.</i>� <i>Id.</i> The court explained further:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;[I]t is the differences between <i>Kirby</i> and the instant
case ... which are determinative. In <i>Kirby,</i> the pop singer was portrayed
as an entirely new character&#8212;the space-age news reporter Ulala. In <i>Band
Hero,</i> by contrast, no matter what else occurs in the game during the
depiction of the No Doubt avatars, the avatars perform rock songs, the same
activity by which the band achieved and maintains its fame. Moreover, the
avatars perform those songs as literal recreations of the band members. That
the avatars can be manipulated to perform at fanciful venues including outer
space or to sing songs the real band would object to singing, or that the
avatars appear in the context of a videogame that contains many other creative
elements, does not transform the avatars into anything other than exact
depictions of No Doubt's members doing exactly what they do as celebrities.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 410&#8211;11. Judge Thomas says that
�[t]he Court of Appeal cited character immutability as a chief factor
distinguishing [<i>No Doubt</i> ] from <i>Winter</i> and <i>Kirby.</i>� Dissent
at 1287. Though No Doubt certainly mentioned the immutability of the avatars,
we do not read the California Court of Appeal's decision as turning on the
inability of users to alter the avatars. The key contrast with <i>Winter</i>
and <i>Kirby</i> was that in those games the public figures were transformed
into �fanciful, creative characters� or �portrayed as ... entirely new
character[s].� <i>No Doubt,</i> 122 Cal.Rptr.3d at 410. On this front, our case
is clearly aligned with <i>No Doubt,</i> not with <i>Winter</i> and <i>Kirby.</i>
We believe No Doubt offers a persuasive precedent that cannot be materially
distinguished from Keller's case.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Third Circuit came to the same conclusion in <i>Hart
v. Electronic Arts, Inc.,</i> 717 F. 3d 141 ( 3d Cir. 2013). In <i>Hart,</i> EA
faced a materially identical challenge under New Jersey right-of-publicity law,
brought by former Rutgers quarterback Ryan Hart. <i>See id.</i> at 163 n. 28 (�<i>Keller</i>
is simply [<i>Hart</i> ] incarnated in California.�). Though the Third Circuit
was tasked with interpreting New Jersey law, the court looked to the
transformative use test developed in California. <i>See id.</i> at 158 n. 23
(noting that the right-of-publicity laws are �strikingly similar ... and
protect similar interests� in New Jersey and California, and that �consequently
[ there is] no issue in applying balancing tests developed in California to New
Jersey�); <i>see also id.</i> at 165 (holding that �the Transformative Use Test
is the proper analytical framework to apply to cases such as the one at bar�).
Applying the test, the court held that �the <i>NCAA Football</i> ... games at
issue ... do not sufficiently transform [ Hart]'s identity to escape the right
of publicity claim,� reversing the district court's grant of summary judgment
to EA. <i>Id.</i> at 170.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we have, the Third Circuit considered the
potentially transformative nature of the game as a whole, <i>id.</i> at 166,
169, and the user's ability to alter avatar characteristics, <i>id.</i> at
166&#8211; 68. Asserting that �the lack of transformative context is even more
pronounced here than in <i>No Doubt,</i>� <i>id.</i> at 166, and that �the
ability to modify the avatar counts for little where the appeal of the game
lies in users' ability to play as, or alongside [,] their preferred players or
team,� <i>id.</i> at 168 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Third Circuit
agreed with us that these changes do not render the <i>NCAA Football</i> games
sufficiently transformative to defeat a right-of-publicity claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Judge Ambro dissented in <i>Hart,</i> concluding
that �the creative components of <i>NCAA Football</i> contain sufficient
expressive transformation to merit First Amendment protection.� <i>Id.</i> at
175 (Ambro, J., dissenting). But in critiquing the majority opinion, Judge
Ambro disregarded <i>No Doubt</i> and <i>Kirby</i> because �they were not
decided by the architect of the Transformative Use Test, the Supreme Court of
California.� <i>Id.</i> at 172 n. 4. He thus �d [id] not attempt to explain or
distinguish the[se cases'] holdings except to note that [he] believe[s] <i>No
Doubt,</i> which focused on individual depictions rather than the work in its
entirety, was wrongly decided in light of the prior precedent in <i>Comedy III</i>
and <i>Winter.</i>� <i>Id.</i> We recognize that we are bound only by the
decisions of a state's highest court and not by decisions of the state's
intermediate appellate court when considering statelaw issues sitting in
diversity jurisdiction. <i>See In re Kirkland,</i> 915 F.2d 1236, 1238&#8211;39
(9th Cir.1990). Nonetheless, where there is no binding precedent from the
state's highest court, we �must predict how the highest state court would
decide the issue using <i>intermediate appellate court decisions,</i> decisions
from other jurisdictions, statutes, treatises, and restatements as guidance.� <i>Id.</i>
at 1239 (emphasis added). As stated above, we believe <i>No Doubt</i> in
particular provides persuasive guidance. We do not believe <i>No Doubt</i> to
be inconsistent with the California Supreme Court's relevant decisions, and we
will not disregard a well-reasoned decision from a state's intermediate
appellate court in this context. Like the majority in <i>Hart,</i> we rely
substantially on <i>No Doubt,</i> and believe we are correct to do so.</p>

Circuit case balancing First Amendment rights against claims under the Lanham
Act. 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir.1989). The case involved a suit brought by the famous
performer Ginger Rogers against the producers and distributors of <i>Ginger and
Fred,</i> a movie about two fictional Italian cabaret performers who imitated
Rogers and her frequent performing partner Fred Astaire. <i>Id.</i> at
996&#8211;97. Rogers alleged both a violation of the Lanham Act for creating
the false impression that she endorsed the film and infringement of her common
law right of publicity. <i>Id.</i> at 997.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Rogers</i> court recognized that �[m]ovies,
plays, books, and songs are all indisputably works of artistic expression and
deserve protection,� but that �[t]he purchaser of a book, like the purchaser of
a can of peas, has a right not to be misled as to the source of the product.� <i>Id.</i>
�Consumers of artistic works thus have a dual interest: They have an interest
in not being misled and they also have an interest in enjoying the results of
the author's freedom of expression.� <i>Id.</i> at 998. The <i>Rogers</i> court
determined that titles of artistic or literary works were less likely to be
misleading than �the names of ordinary commercial products,� and thus that
Lanham Act protections applied with less rigor when considering titles of
artistic or literary works than when considering ordinary products. <i>Id.</i>
at 999&#8211;1000. The court concluded that �in general the Act should be
construed to apply to artistic works only where the public interest in avoiding
consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression.� <i>Id.</i>
at 999. The court therefore held:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the context of allegedly misleading titles using a
celebrity's name, that balance will normally not support application of the
[Lanham] Act unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work
whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly
misleads as to the source or the content of the work.</p>

depiction of East Los Angeles, violating the club's trademark right to that
logo. 547 F.3d 1095, 1096&#8211;98 (9th Cir.2008). We held that Rock Star's use
of the logo and trade dress was protected by the First Amendment and that it
therefore could not be held liable under the Lanham Act. <i>Id.</i> at
1099&#8211;1101. In so doing, we extended the Rogers test slightly, noting that
�[a]lthough this test traditionally applies to uses of a trademark in the title
of an artistic work, there is no principled reason why it ought not also apply
to the use of a trademark in the body of the work.� <i>Id.</i> at 1099.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, EA argues that we should extend this
test, created to evaluate Lanham Act claims, to apply to right-of-publicity
claims because it is �less prone to misinterpretation� and �more protective of
free expression� than the transformative use defense. Although we acknowledge
that there is some overlap between the transformative use test formulated by
the California Supreme Court and the <i>Rogers</i> test, we disagree that the <i>Rogers</i>
test should be imported wholesale for right-of-publicity claims. Our conclusion
on this point is consistent with the Third Circuit's rejection of EA's
identical argument in <i>Hart. See Hart,</i> 717 F. 3d at 154&#8211; 58. As the
history and development of the <i>Rogers</i> test makes clear, it was designed
to protect consumers from the risk of consumer confusion&#8212;the hallmark
element of a Lanham Act claim. <i>See Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co.,</i> 292 F.3d
1139, 1149 (9th Cir.2002). The right of publicity, on the other hand, does not
primarily seek to prevent consumer confusion. <i>See Hart,</i> 717 F. 3d at 158
(�[ T]he right of publicity does not implicate the potential for consumer
confusion....�). Rather, it primarily �protects a form of intellectual property
[in one's person] that society deems to have some social utility.� <i>Comedy
III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 804. As the California Supreme Court
has explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Often considerable money, time and energy are needed to
develop one's prominence in a particular field. Years of labor may be required
before one's skill, reputation, notoriety or virtues are sufficiently developed
to permit an economic return through some medium of commercial promotion. For
some, the investment may eventually create considerable commercial value in
one's identity.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 804&#8211;05
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The right of publicity protects the <i>celebrity,</i>
not the <i>consumer.</i> Keller's publicity claim is not founded on an
allegation that consumers are being illegally misled into believing that he is
endorsing EA or its products. Indeed, he would be hard-pressed to support such
an allegation absent evidence that EA explicitly misled consumers into holding
such a belief. <i>See Brown v. Elec. Arts,</i> 724 F.3d at 1242&#8211;43, 2013
WL 3927736, at *4 (holding under the <i>Rogers</i> test that, since �Brown's
likeness is artistically relevant to the [<i>Madden NFL</i> ] games and there
are no alleged facts to support the claim that EA explicitly misled consumers
as to Brown's involvement with the games,� �the public interest in free
expression outweighs the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion�).
Instead, Keller's claim is that EA has appropriated, without permission and
without providing compensation, his talent and years of hard work on the
football field. The reasoning of the <i>Rogers</i> and <i>Mattel</i>
courts&#8212;that artistic and literary works should be protected unless they
explicitly mislead consumers&#8212;is simply not responsive to Keller's
asserted interests here. <i>Cf. Hart,</i> 717 F. 3d at 157 (�Effectively, [EA]
argues that [Hart] should be unable to assert a claim for appropriating his
likeness as a football player precisely because his likeness was used for a
game about football. Adopting this line of reasoning threatens to turn the
right of publicity on its head.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We recognize that <i>Rogers</i> also dealt with a
right-of-publicity claim-one under Oregon law&#8212;and applied a modified
version of its Lanham Act test in order to adapt to that particular context:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In light of the Oregon Court's concern for the protection
of free expression, ... the right of publicity [would not] bar the use of a
celebrity's name in a movie title unless the title was �wholly unrelated� to
the movie or was �simply a disguised commercial advertisement for the sale of
goods or services.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>875 F.2d at 1004. However, the <i>Rogers</i> court was
faced with a situation in which the �Oregon Courts ... [had] not determined the
scope of the common law right of publicity in that state.� <i>Id.</i> at 1002.
In the absence of clear state-law precedent, the <i>Rogers</i> court was
�obliged to engage in the uncertain task of predicting what the New York courts
would predict the Oregon courts would rule as to the contours of a right of
publicity under Oregon law.� <i>Id.</i> In light of <i>Comedy III</i> and its
progeny, we are faced with no such uncertain task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Lastly, we note that the only circuit court to
import the <i>Rogers</i> test into the publicity arena, the Sixth Circuit, has
done so inconsistently. In <i>Parks v. LaFace Records,</i> the Sixth Circuit
indicated that the <i>Rogers</i> test was appropriate for right-of-publicity
claims, noting that the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition had endorsed
use of the test in that context. 329 F.3d 437, 461 (6th Cir.2003) (citing <i>Restatement
(Third) of Unfair Competition</i> � 47 cmt. c). Subsequently, in <i>ETW Corp.
v. Jireh Publishing, Inc.,</i> the court acknowledged the <i>Parks</i> decision
but did not apply the <i>Rogers</i> test to the Ohio right-of-publicity claim
in question. 332 F.3d at 915, 936 &amp; n. 17 (6th Cir.2003). Instead, the
court applied a balancing test from comment d in the <i>Restatement</i>
(analyzing �the substantiality and market effect of the use of the celebrity's
image ... in light of the informational and creative content�), as well as the
transformative use test from <i>Comedy III. Id.</i> at 937&#8211;38; <i>see
Hart,</i> 717 F. 3d at 157 (�We find Parks to be less than persuasive [as to
the applicability of the Rogers test to right-of-publicity cases] given&nbsp;
that&nbsp; just&nbsp; over&nbsp; a&nbsp; month&nbsp; later&nbsp; another&nbsp;
panel&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sixth&nbsp; Circuit&nbsp; decided [<i>ETW</i> ],
a right of publicity case where the Circuit applied the Transformative Use
Test.�). Similarly, the Tenth Circuit in <i>Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League
Baseball Players Ass'n,</i> 95 F.3d 959 (10th Cir.1996), and the Eighth Circuit
in <i>C.B.C. Distribution and Marketing, Inc. v. Major League Baseball Advanced
Media, L.P.,</i> 505 F.3d 818 (8th Cir.2007), rejected the <i>Rogers</i> test
in favor of a flexible case-by-case approach that takes into account the
celebrity's interest in retaining his or her publicity and the public's
interest in free expression. Therefore, we decline EA's invitation to extend
the <i>Rogers</i> test to right-of-publicity claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> California has developed two additional defenses
aimed at protecting the reporting of factual information under state law. One
of these defenses only applies to common law right-of-publicity claims while
the other only applies to statutory right-of-publicity claims. <i>Montana v.
San Jose Mercury News, Inc.,</i> 34 Cal.App.4th 790, 40 Cal.Rptr.2d 639, 640
(1995). Liability will not lie for common law right-of-publicity claims for the
�publication of matters in the public interest.� <i>Id.</i> at 640&#8211;41.
Similarly, liability will not lie for statutory right-of-publicity claims for
the �use of a name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in connection
with any news, public affairs, or sports broadcast or account, or any political
campaign.� Cal. Civ.Code � 3344(d). Although these defenses are based on First
Amendment concerns, <i>Gill v. Hearst Publ'g Co.,</i> 40 Cal.2d 224, 253 P.2d
441, 443&#8211;44 (1953), they are not coextensive with the Federal
Constitution, <i>New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ'g, Inc.,</i> 971 F.2d
302, 310 n. 10 (9th Cir.1992), and their application is thus a matter of state
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> EA argues that these defenses give it the right to
�incorporate athletes' names, statistics, and other biographical information�
into its expressive works, as the defenses were �designed to create �extra
breathing space� for the use of a person's name in connection with matters of
public interest.� Keller responds that the right of publicity yields to free
use of a public figure's likeness only to the extent reasonably required to
report information to the public or publish factual data, and that the defenses
apply only to broadcasts or accounts of public affairs, not to EA's <i>NCAA
Football</i> games, which do not contain or constitute such reporting about
Keller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> California courts have generally analyzed the
common law defense and the statutory defense separately, but it is clear that
both defenses protect only the act of publishing or reporting. By its terms, �
3344(d) is limited to a �broadcast or account,� and we have confirmed that the
common law defense is about a publication or reporting of newsworthy items. <i>Hilton,</i>
599 F.3d at 912. However, most of the discussion by California courts pertains
to whether the subject matter of the communication is of �public interest� or
related to �news� or �public affairs,� leaving little guidance as to when the
communication constitutes a publication or reporting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For instance, in <i>Dora v. Frontline Video, Inc.,</i>
a wellknown surfer sued the producer of a documentary on surfing entitled �The
Legends of Malibu,� claiming misappropriation of his name and likeness. 15
Cal.App.4th 536, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 790, 791 (1993). The court held that the
documentary was protected because it was �a fair comment on real life events
which have caught the popular imagination.� <i>Id.</i> at 792 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The court explained that surfing �has created a
lifestyle that influences speech, behavior, dress, and entertainment,� has had
�an economic impact,� and �has also had a significant influence on the popular
culture,� such that �[i]t would be difficult to conclude that a surfing
documentary does not fall within the category of public affairs.� <i>Id.</i> at
794&#8211;95. Similarly, in <i>Gionfriddo v. Major League Baseball,</i> retired
professional baseball players alleged that Major League Baseball violated their
right of publicity by displaying �factual data concerning the players, their
performance statistics, and verbal descriptions and video depictions of their play�
in game programs and on its website. 94 Cal.App.4th 400, 114 Cal.Rptr.2d 307,
314 (2001). The court reasoned that �[t]he recitation and discussion of factual
data concerning the athletic performance of these plaintiffs command a
substantial public interest, and, therefore, is a form of expression due
substantial constitutional protection.� <i>Id.</i> at 315. And in <i>Montana v.
San Jose Mercury News, Inc.,</i> former NFL quarterback Joe Montana brought a
right-of-publicity action against a newspaper for selling posters containing
previously published pages from the newspaper depicting the many Super Bowl
victories by Montana and the San Francisco 49ers. <i>Montana,</i> 40
Cal.Rptr.2d at 639&#8211;40. The court found that �[p]osters portraying the
49'ers' [sic] victories are ... a form of public interest presentation to which
protection must be extended.� <i>Id.</i> at 641 (internal quotation marks
omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We think that, unlike in <i>Gionfriddo, Montana</i>,
and <i>Dora,</i> EA is not publishing or reporting factual data. EA's video
game is a means by which users can play their own virtual football games, not a
means for obtaining information about real-world football games. Although EA
has incorporated certain actual player information into the game (height,
weight, etc.), its case is considerably weakened by its decision not to include
the athletes' names along with their likenesses and statistical data. EA can
hardly be considered to be �reporting� on Keller's career at Arizona State and Nebraska
when it is not even using Keller's name in connection with his avatar in the
game. Put simply, EA's interactive game is not a publication of facts about
college football; it is a game, not a reference source. These state law
defenses, therefore, do not apply.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span

use of the likenesses of college athletes like Samuel Keller in its video games
is not, as a matter of law, protected by the First Amendment. We reject EA's

protect EA's use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the creative and transformative elements of
Electronic Arts' <i>NCAA Football</i> video game series predominate over the

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As expressive works, video games are entitled to
First Amendment protection. <i>Brown v. Entm't Merchs. Ass'n,</i>
&#8211;&#8211;&#8211; U.S. &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;, 131 S.Ct. 2729 (2011).
The First Amendment affords additional protection to <i>NCAA Football</i>
because it involves a subject of substantial public interest: collegiate
football. <i>Moore v. Univ. of Notre Dame,</i> 968 F.Supp. 1330, 1337
(N.D.Ind.1997). Because football is a matter of public interest, the use of the
images of athletes is entitled to constitutional protection, even if profits
are involved. <i>Montana v. San Jose Mercury News, Inc.,</i> 34 Cal.App.4th
790, 40 Cal.Rptr.2d 639, 643 n. 2 (1995); <i>see also</i> Cal. Civ.Code �
3344(d) (exempting from liability the �use of a name ... or likeness in
connection with any ... public affairs, or sports broadcast or account�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Where it is recognized, the tort of appropriation
is a creature of common law or statute, depending on the jurisdiction. However,
the right to compensation for the misappropriation for commercial use of one's
image or celebrity is far from absolute. In every jurisdiction, any right of
publicity must be balanced against the constitutional protection afforded by
the First Amendment. Courts have employed a variety of methods in balancing the
rights. <i>See, e.g., Doe v. TCI Cablevision,</i> 110 S.W.3d 363, 374 (Mo.2003)
(en banc). The California Supreme Court applies a �transformative use� test it
formulated in <i>Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc.,</i> 25
Cal.4th 387, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d 797 (2001).<a href="#_ftn51"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the majority properly notes, the transformative
use defense is �a balancing test between the First Amendment and the right of
publicity based on whether the work in question adds significant creative
elements so as to be transformed into something more than a mere celebrity
likeness<b> </b>or imitation.� <i>Comedy III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d
at 799. The rationale for the test, as the majority notes, is that �when a work
contains significant transformative elements, it is not only especially worthy
of First Amendment protection, but it is also less likely to interfere with the
economic interest protected by the right of publicity.� <i>Id.</i> 106
Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 808.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The five considerations articulated in <i>Comedy
III,</i> and cited by the majority, are whether: (1) the celebrity likeness is
one of the raw materials from which an original work is synthesized; (2) the
work is primarily the defendant's own expression if the expression is something
other than the likeness of the celebrity; (3) the literal and imitative or
creative elements predominate in the work; (4) the marketability and economic
value of the challenged work derives primarily from the fame of the celebrity
depicted; and (5) an artist's skill and talent has been manifestly subordinated
to the overall goal of creating a conventional portrait of a celebrity so as to
commercially exploit the celebrity's fame. <i>Id.</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21
P.3d at 809&#8211;10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although these considerations are often distilled
as analytical factors, Justice Mosk was careful in <i>Comedy III</i> not to
label them as such. Indeed, the focus of <i>Comedy III</i> is a more holistic
examination of whether the transformative and creative elements of a particular
work predominate over commercially based literal or imitative depictions. The
distinction is critical, because excessive deconstruction of <i>Comedy III</i>
can lead to misapplication of the test. And it is at this juncture that I must
respectfully part ways with my colleagues in the majority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority confines its inquiry to how a single
athlete's likeness is represented in the video game, rather than examining the
transformative and creative elements in the video game as a whole. In my view,
this approach contradicts the holistic analysis required by the transformative
use test. <i>See Hart v. Elec. Arts, Inc.,</i> 717 F. 3d 141, 170&#8211; 76 (
3d Cir. 2013) (Ambro, J., dissenting).<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[52]</span></span></span></a>
The salient question is whether the entire work is transformative, and whether
the transformative elements predominate, rather than whether an individual
persona or image has been altered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When EA's <i>NCAA Football</i> video game series is
examined carefully, and put in proper context, I conclude that the creative and
transformative elements of the games predominate over the commercial use of the
likenesses of the athletes within the games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first step in conducting a balancing is to
examine the creative work at issue. At its essence, EA's <i>NCAA Football</i>
is a work of interactive historical fiction. Although the game changes from
year to year, its most popular features predominately involve role-playing by
the gamer. For example, a player can create a virtual image of himself as a
potential college football player. The virtual player decides which position he
would like to play, then participates in a series of �tryouts� or competes in
an entire high school season to gauge his skill. Based on his performance, the
virtual player is ranked and available to play at select colleges. The player
chooses among the colleges, then assumes the role of a college football player.
He also selects a major, the amount of time he wishes to spend on social
activities, and practice&#8212;all of which may affect the virtual player's
performance. He then plays his position on the college team. In some versions
of the game, in another mode, the virtual player can engage in a competition
for the Heisman Trophy. In another popular mode, the gamer becomes a virtual
coach. The coach scouts, recruits, and develops entirely fictional players for
his team. The coach can then promote the team's evolution over decades of
seasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The college teams that are supplied in the game do
replicate the actual college teams for that season, including virtual athletes
who bear the statistical and physical dimensions of the actual college
athletes. But, unlike their professional football counterparts in the <i>Madden
NFL</i> series, the NCAA football players in these games are not identified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The gamers can also change their abilities,
appearances, and physical characteristics at will. Keller's impressive physical
likeness can be morphed by the gamer into an overweight and slow virtual
athlete, with anemic passing ability. And the gamer can create new virtual
players out of whole cloth. Players can change teams. The gamer could pit Sam
Keller against himself, or a stronger or weaker version of himself, on a
different team. Or the gamer could play the game endlessly without ever
encountering Keller's avatar. In the simulated games, the gamer controls not
only the conduct of the game, but the weather, crowd noise, mascots, and other
environmental factors. Of course, one may play the game leaving the players
unaltered, pitting team against team. But, in this context as well, the work is
one of historic fiction. The gamer controls the teams, players, and games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying the <i>Comedy III</i> considerations to <i>NCAA
Football</i> in proper holistic context, the considerations favor First
Amendment protection. The athletic likenesses are but one of the raw materials
from which the broader game is constructed. The work, considered as a whole, is
primarily one of EA's own expression. The creative and transformative elements
predominate over the commercial use of likenesses. The marketability and
economic value of the game comes from the creative elements within, not from
the pure commercial exploitation of a celebrity image. The game is not a
conventional portrait of a celebrity, but a work consisting of many creative
and transformative elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The video game at issue is much akin to the
creations the California Supreme Court found protected in <i>Winter v. DC
Comics,</i> 30 Cal.4th 881, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 P.3d 473, 476 (2003), where
the two fabled guitarists Johnny and Edgar Winter were easily identifiable, but
depicted as chimeras. It is also consistent with the California Court of
Appeal's decision in <i>Kirby v. Sega of America, Inc.,</i> 144 Cal.App.4th 47,
50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607, 609&#8211;10 (2006), where a character easily identified as
singer Kierin Kirby, more popularly known as Lady Miss Kier, was transformed
into a � �fanciful, creative character� who exists in the context of a unique
and expressive video game.� <i>Id.</i> at 618. So, too, are the virtual players
who populate the world of the <i>NCAA Football</i> series.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>No Doubt v. Activision Publishing, Inc.,</i> 192
Cal.App.4th 1018, 122 Cal.Rptr.3d 397 (2011), is not to the contrary. The
literal representations in <i>No Doubt</i> were not, and could not be,
transformed in any way. Indeed, in <i>No Doubt,</i> the bandmembers posed for
motion-capture photography to allow reproduction of their likenesses, <i>id.</i>
at 402, and the Court of Appeal underscored the fact that the video game did
not �permit players to alter the No Doubt avatars in any respect� and the
avatars remained �at all times immutable images of the real celebrity
musicians,� <i>id.</i> at 410. The Court of Appeal cited character immutability
as a chief factor distinguishing that case from <i>Winter</i> and <i>Kirby. Id.</i>
Unlike the avatars in <i>No Doubt,</i> the virtual players in NCAA Football are
completely mutable and changeable at the whim of the gamer. The majority places
great reliance on <i>No Doubt</i> as support for its proposition that the
initial placement of realistic avatars in the game overcomes the First
Amendment's protection, but the Court of Appeal in <i>No Doubt</i> rejected
such a cramped construction, noting that �even literal reproductions of
celebrities may be �transformed� into expressive works based on the context
into which the celebrity image is placed.� <i>Id.</i> at 410 (citing <i>Comedy
III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 797).<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53"

style='color:gray'>]</span> Unlike the majority, I would not punish EA for the
realism of its games and for the skill of the artists who created realistic
settings for the football games. Majority op. at 1279 n. 10. That the lifelike
roar of the crowd and the crunch of pads contribute to the gamer's experience
demonstrates how little of <i>NCAA Football</i> is driven by the particular
likeness of Sam Keller, or any of the other plaintiffs, rather than by the
game's artistic elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In short, considering the creative elements alone
in this case satisfies the transformative use test in favor of First Amendment
protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CenteredBold>B</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although one could leave the analysis with an
examination of the transformative and creative aspects of the game, a true
balancing requires an inquiry as to the other side of the scales: the publicity
right at stake. Here, as well, the <i>NCAA Football</i> video game series can
be distinguished from the traditional right of publicity cases, both from a
quantitative and a qualitative perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a quantitative matter, <i>NCAA Football</i> is
different from other right of publicity cases in the sheer number of virtual
actors involved. Most right of publicity cases involve either one celebrity, or
a finite and defined group of celebrities. <i>Comedy III</i> involved literal
likenesses of the Three Stooges. <i>Hilton v. Hallmark Cards,</i> 599 F.3d 894,
909&#8211;12 (9th Cir.2009), involved the literal likeness of Paris Hilton. <i>Winter</i>
involved the images of the rock star brother duo. <i>Kirby</i> involved the
likeness of one singer. <i>No Doubt</i> focused on the likenesses of the
members of a specific legendary band.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In contrast, <i>NCAA Football</i> includes not just
Sam Keller, but thousands of virtual actors. This consideration is of
particular significance when we examine, as instructed by <i>Comedy III,</i>
whether the source of the product marketability comes from creative elements or
from pure exploitation of a celebrity image. 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at
810. There is not, at this stage of the litigation, any evidence as to the
personal marketing power of Sam Keller, as distinguished from the appeal of the
creative aspects of the product. Regardless, the sheer number of athletes
involved inevitably diminish the significance of the publicity right at issue. <i>Comedy
III</i> involved literal depictions of the Three Stooges on lithographs and
T-shirts. <i>Winter</i> involved characters depicted in a comic strip. <i>Kirby</i>
and <i>No Doubt</i> involved pivotal characters in a video game. The commercial
image of the celebrities in each case was central to the production, and its
contact with the consumer was immediate and unavoidable. In contrast, one could
play <i>NCAA Football</i> thousands of times without ever encountering a
particular avatar. In context of the collective, an individual's publicity
right is relatively insignificant. Put another way, if an anonymous virtual
player is tackled in an imaginary video game and no one notices, is there any
right of publicity infringed at all?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The sheer quantity of the virtual players in the
game underscores the inappropriateness of analyzing the right of publicity
through the lens of one likeness only. Only when the creative work is
considered in complete context can a proper analysis be conducted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a qualitative matter, the essence of <i>NCAA
Football</i> is founded on publicly available data, which is not protected by
any individual publicity rights. It is true that EA solicits and receives
information directly from colleges and universities. But the information is
hardly proprietary. Personal vital statistics for players are found in college
programs and media guides. Likewise, playing statistics are easily available.
In this respect, the information used by EA is indistinguishable from the
information used in fantasy athletic leagues, for which the First Amendment
provides protection, <i>C.B.C. Distribution &amp; Mktg., Inc. v. Major League
Baseball Advanced Media, L.P.,</i> 505 F.3d 818, 823&#8211;24 (8th Cir.2007),
or much beloved statistical board games, such as Strat&#8211;O&#8211;Matic. An
athlete's right of publicity simply does not encompass publicly available
statistical data. <i>See, e.g., IMS Health Inc. v. Sorrell,</i> 630 F.3d 263,
271&#8211;72 (2d Cir.2010) (�The First Amendment protects �[e]ven dry
information, devoid of advocacy, political relevance, or artistic expression.�
� (quoting <i>Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley,</i> 273 F.3d 429, 446 (2d
Cir.2001)) (alteration in original)).<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[54]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Further, the structure of the game is not founded
on exploitation of an individual's publicity rights. The players are
unidentified and anonymous. It is true that third-party software is available
to quickly identify the players, but that is not part of the EA package. And
the fact that the players can be identified by the knowledgeable user by their
position, team, and statistics is somewhat beside the point. The issue is
whether the marketability of the product is driven by an individual celebrity,
or by the game itself. <i>Comedy III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 810.
Player anonymity, while certainly not a complete defense, bears on the question
of how we balance the right of publicity against the First Amendment. This
feature of the game places it in stark contrast with <i>No Doubt,</i> where the
whole point of the enterprise was the successful commercial exploitation of the
specifically identified, world-famous musicians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, as a qualitative matter, the publicity
rights of college athletes are remarkably restricted. This consideration is
critical because the �right to exploit commercially one's celebrity is
primarily an economic right.� <i>Gionfriddo v. Major League Baseball,</i> 94
Cal.App.4th 400, 114 Cal.Rptr.2d 307, 318 (2001). NCAA rules prohibit athletes
from benefitting economically from any success on the field. NCAA Bylaw 12.5
specifically prohibits commercial licensing of an NCAA athlete's name or
picture. NCAA, <i>2012&#8211;13 NCAA Division I Manual</i> � 12.5.2.1 (2012).
Before being allowed to compete each year, all Division I NCAA athletes must
sign a contract stating that they understand the prohibition on licensing and
affirming that they have not violated any amateurism rules. In short, even if
an athlete wished to license his image to EA, the athlete could not do so
without destroying amateur status. Thus, an individual college athlete's right
of publicity is extraordinarily circumscribed and, in practical reality,
nonexistent.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[55]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, even apart from consideration of
transformative elements, examination of the right of publicity in question also
resolves the balance in favor of the First Amendment. The quantity of players
involved dilutes the commercial impact of any particular player and the scope
of the publicity right is significantly reduced by the fact that: (1) a player
cannot own the individual, publicly available statistics on which the game is
based; (2) the players are not identified in the game; and (3) NCAA college athletes
do not have the right to license their names and likenesses, even if they chose
to do so.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span

<p class=CenteredBold>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Given the proper application of the transformative
use test, Keller is unlikely to prevail. The balance of interests falls
squarely on the side of the First Amendment. The stakes are not small. The
logical consequence of the majority view is that all realistic depictions of
actual persons, no matter how incidental, are protected by a state law right of
publicity regardless of the creative context. This logic jeopardizes the
creative use of historic figures in motion pictures, books, and sound
recordings. Absent the use of actual footage, the motion picture <i>Forrest
Gump</i> might as well be just a box of chocolates. Without its historical
characters, <i>Midnight in Paris</i> would be reduced to a pedestrian domestic
squabble. The majority's holding that creative use of realistic images and
personas does not satisfy the transformative use test cannot be reconciled with
the many cases affording such works First Amendment protection.<a href="#_ftn57"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[57]</span></span></span></a> I respectfully disagree with
this potentially dangerous and out-of-context interpretation of the
transformative use test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

In warning of a first amendment chill to expressive conduct, the dissent reads
this decision too broadly. <i>See Dissent</i> at 1407. This case concerns only
the market which exists in our society for the exploitation of celebrity to
sell products, and an attempt to take a free ride on a celebrity's celebrity
value. Commercial advertising which relies on celebrity fame is different from
other forms of expressive activity in two crucial ways.</p>

In the words of Sir Isaac Newton, �[i]f I have seen further it is by standing
on [the shoulders] of Giants.� Letter to Robert Hooke, Feb. 5, 1675/1676.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Newton himself may have borrowed this phrase from Bernard of
Chartres, who said something similar in the early twelfth century. Bernard in
turn may have snatched it from Priscian, a sixth century grammarian. <i>See
Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Paperback Software Int'l,</i> 740 F.Supp. 37, 77 n. 3

In fact, in the one California case raising the issue, the three state Supreme
Court Justices who discussed this theory expressed serious doubts about it. <i>Guglielmi
v. Spelling-Goldberg Prods.,</i> 25 Cal.3d 860, 864 n. 5, 160 Cal.Rptr. 352,
355 n. 5, 603 P.2d 454, 457 n. 5 (1979) (Bird, C.J., concurring) (expressing
skepticism about finding a property right to a celebrity's �personality�
because it is �difficult to discern any easily applied definition for this
amorphous term�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither have we previously interpreted California law to
cover pure �identity.� <i>Midler v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 849 F.2d 460 (9th
Cir.1988), and <i>Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc.,</i> 978 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir.1992),
dealt with appropriation of a celebrity's voice. <i>See id.</i> at 1100-01
(imitation of singing style, rather than voice, doesn't violate the right of
publicity).</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><i>Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i>
498 F.2d 821 (9th Cir.1974), stressed that, though the plaintiff's likeness
wasn't directly recognizable by itself, the surrounding circumstances would
have made viewers think the likeness was the plaintiff's. <i>Id.</i> at 827; <i>see
also Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.,</i> 51 Cal.3d 120, 138, 271
Cal.Rptr. 146, 157, 793 P.2d 479, 490 (1990) (construing <i>Motschenbacher</i>

Some viewers might have inferred White was endorsing the product, but that's a
different story. The right of publicity isn't aimed at or limited to false
endorsements, <i>Eastwood v. Superior Court,</i> 149 Cal.App.3d 409, 419-20,
198 Cal.Rptr. 342, 348 (1983); that's what the Lanham Act is for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note also that the majority's rule applies even to
advertisements that unintentionally remind people of someone. California law is
crystal clear that the common-law right of publicity may be violated even by
unintentional appropriations. <i>Id.</i> at 417 n. 6, 198 Cal.Rptr. at 346 n.
6; <i>Fairfield v. American Photocopy Equipment Co.,</i> 138 Cal.App.2d 82, 87,

Once the right of publicity is extended beyond specific physical
characteristics, this will become a recurring problem: Outside name, likeness
and voice, the things that most reliably remind the public of celebrities are
the actions or roles they're famous for. A commercial with an astronaut setting
foot on the moon would evoke the image of Neil Armstrong. Any masked man on
horseback would remind people (over a certain age) of Clayton Moore. And any
number of songs&#8212;�My Way,� �Yellow Submarine,� �Like a Virgin,� �Beat It,�
�Michael, Row the Boat Ashore,� to name only a few&#8212;instantly evoke an
image of the person or group who made them famous, regardless of who is
singing.</p>

If Christian Slater, star of �Heathers,� �Pump up the Volume,� �Kuffs,� and
�Untamed Heart�&#8212;and alleged Jack Nicholson clone&#8212;appears in a

Slater, 26 talk about Slater's alleged similarities to Nicholson. Apparently
it's his nasal wisecracks and killer smiles, St. Petersburg Times, Jan. 10,

Just compare the majority's holding to the intellectual property laws upheld by
the Supreme Court. The Copyright Act is constitutional precisely because of the
fair use doctrine and the idea-expression dichotomy, <i>Harper &amp; Row v.
Nation Enterprises,</i> 471 U.S. 539, 560, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 2230, 85 L.Ed.2d 588
(1985), two features conspicuously absent from the majority's doctrine. The
right of publicity at issue in <i>Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.,</i>
433 U.S. 562, 576, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 2857-58, 53 L.Ed.2d 965 (1977), was only the
right to �broadcast of petitioner's entire performance,� not �the unauthorized
use of another's name for purposes of trade.� <i>Id.</i> Even the statute
upheld in <i>San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic

The majority's failure to recognize a parody exception to the right of
publicity would apply equally to parodies of politicians as of actresses.
Consider the case of Wok Fast, a Los Angeles Chinese food delivery service,
which put up a billboard with a picture of then-L.A. Police Chief Daryl Gates
and the text �When you can't leave the office. Or won't.� (This was an allusion
to Chief Gates's refusal to retire despite pressure from Mayor Tom Bradley.)
Gates forced the restaurant to take the billboard down by threatening a right
of publicity lawsuit. Leslie Berger, <i>He Did Leave the Office-And Now Sign

compared to the public figures in other California right-of-publicity cases all
mitigate in favor of finding that the EA's First Amendment rights outweigh
Keller's right of publicity. <i>See</i> Dissent at 1286&#8211;88. These facts
are not irrelevant to the analysis&#8212;they all can be considered in the
framework of the five considerations from <i>Comedy III</i> laid out
above&#8212;but the fact is that EA elected to use avatars that mimic real
college football players for a reason. If EA did not think there was value in
having an avatar designed to mimic each individual player, it would not go to
the lengths it does to achieve realism in this regard. Having chosen to use the
players' likenesses, EA cannot now hide behind the numerosity of its potential
offenses or the alleged unimportance of any one individual player.</p>

EA further argues that <i>No Doubt</i> is distinguishable because the video
game company in that case entered into a license agreement which it allegedly
breached. However, the California Court of Appeal did not rely on breach of
contract in its analysis of whether the game was transformative. 122
Cal.Rptr.3d at 412 n. 7. Keller asserts here that EA contracted away its First
Amendment rights in a licensing agreement with the NCAA that purportedly
prohibited the use of athlete likenesses. However, in light of our conclusion
that EA is not entitled to a First Amendment defense as a matter of law, we
need not reach this issue and leave it for the district court to address in the
first instance on remand should the finder of fact determine in post-SLAPP
proceedings that EA's use is transformative.</p>

In dissent, Judge Thomas suggests that this case is distinguishable from other
right-to-publicity cases because �an individual college athlete's right of
publicity is extraordinarily circumscribed and, in practical reality,
nonexistent� because �NCAA rules prohibit athletes from benefitting
economically from any success on the field.� Dissent at 1289. Judge Thomas
commendably addresses the fairness of this structure, <i>see</i> Dissent at
1289 n. 5, but setting fairness aside, the fact is that college athletes are
not indefinitely bound by NCAA rules. Once an athlete graduates from college,
for instance, the athlete can capitalize on his success on the field during
college in any number of ways. EA's use of a college athlete's likeness
interferes with the athlete's right to capitalize on his athletic success once
he is beyond the dominion of NCAA rule.</p>

Judge Thomas asserts that �[t]he logical consequence of the majority view is
that all realistic depictions of actual persons, no matter how incidental, are
protected by a state law right of publicity regardless of the creative
context,� �jeopardiz[ing] the creative use of historic figures in motion
pictures, books, and sound recordings.� Dissent at 1290. We reject the notion
that our holding has such broad consequences. As discussed above, one of the
factors identified in <i>Comedy III</i> �requires an examination of whether a
likely purchaser's primary motivation is to buy a reproduction of the
celebrity, or to buy the expressive work of that artist.� McCarthy, <i>supra,</i>
� 8:72; <i>see Comedy III,</i> 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 809. Certainly
this leaves room for distinguishing between this case&#8212;where we have
emphasized EA's primary emphasis on reproducing reality&#8212;and cases involving
other kinds of expressive works.</p>

Keller argues that EA never asked the district court to apply <i>Rogers</i> and
has therefore waived the issue on appeal. Although it could have been more
explicit, EA's anti-SLAPP motion did cite <i>Rogers</i> and argue that Keller
had not alleged that his likeness was �wholly unrelated� to the content of the
video game or a �disguised commercial advertisement,� the two prongs of the <i>Rogers</i>
test.</p>

We similarly reject Judge Thomas's argument that Keller's right-of-publicity
claim should give way to the First Amendment in light of the fact that �the
essence of <i>NCAA Football</i> is founded on publicly available data.� Dissent
at 1288. Judge Thomas compares <i>NCAA Football</i> to the fantasy baseball
products that the Eighth Circuit deemed protected by the First Amendment in the
face of a right-of-publicity claim in <i>C.B.C. Distribution and Marketing,</i>
505 F.3d at 823&#8211;24. Dissent at 1288. But there is a big difference
between a video game like <i>NCAA Football</i> and fantasy baseball products
like those at issue in <i>C.B.C.</i> Those products merely �incorporate[d] the
names along with performance and biographical data of actual major league
baseball players.� <i>Id.</i> at 820. <i>NCAA Football,</i> on the other hand,
uses virtual likenesses of actual college football players. It is seemingly
true that each likeness is generated largely from publicly available
data&#8212;though, as Judge Thomas acknowledges, EA solicits certain
information directly from schools&#8212;but finding this fact dispositive would
neuter the right of publicity in our digital world. Computer programmers with
the appropriate expertise can create a realistic likeness of any celebrity
using only publicly available data. If EA creates a virtual likeness of Tom
Brady using only publicly available data&#8212;public images and videos of
Brady&#8212;does EA have free reign to use that likeness in commercials without
violating Brady's right of publicity? We think not, and thus must reject Judge
Thomas's point about the public availability of much of the data used given
that EA produced and used actual likenesses of the athletes involved.</p>

I agree with the majority that the test articulated in <i>Rogers v. Grimaldi,</i>
875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir.1989), should not be employed in this context. The <i>Rogers</i>
test is appropriately applied in Lanham Act cases, where the primary concern is
with the danger of consumer confusion when a work is depicted as something it
is not. 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1). However, the right of publicity is an economic
right to use the value of one own's celebrity. <i>Zacchini v. Scripps&#8211;Howard
Broad. Co.,</i> 433 U.S. 562, 576&#8211;77, 97 S.Ct. 2849, 53 L.Ed.2d 965
(1977). Therefore, a more nuanced balancing is required. In our context, I
believe the transformative use test&#8212;if correctly applied to the work as a
whole&#8212;provides the proper analytical framework.</p>

Of course, to the extent that the Court of Appeal's opinion in <i>No Doubt</i>
may be read to be in tension with the transformative use test as articulated by
the California Supreme Court in <i>Comedy III</i> and <i>Winter,</i> it must
yield.</p>

Contrary to the majority's suggestion, I do not claim that any use of a
likeness founded on publicly available information is transformative. Majority
op. 1283&#8211;84 n. 12. The majority's analogy to a commercial featuring Tom
Brady is inapposite for at least two reasons: (1) a commercial is not
interactive in the same way that <i>NCAA Football</i> is, and (2) Brady's
marketing power is well established, while that of the plaintiffs is not.</p>

The issue of whether this structure is fair to the student athlete is beyond
the scope of this appeal, but forms a significant backdrop to the discussion.
The NCAA received revenues of $871.6 million in fiscal year 2011&#8211;12, with
81% of the money coming from television and marketing fees. However, few
college athletes will ever receive any professional compensation. The NCAA
reports that in 2011, there were 67,887 college football players. Of those,
15,086 were senior players, and only 255 athletes were drafted for a
professional team. Thus, only 1.7% of seniors received any subsequent
professional economic compensation for their athletic endeavors. NCAA, <i>Estimated
Probability of Competing in Athletics Beyond the High School Interscholastic
Level</i> (2011), <i>available at</i> http:// www. ncaa. org/ wps/ wcm/
connect/ public/ ncaa/ pdfs/ 2011/ 2011+ probability+ of+ going+ pro.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And participation in college football can come at a terrible
cost. The NCAA reports that, during a recent five-year period, college football
players suffered 41,000 injuries, including 23 non-fatal catastrophic injuries
and 11 fatalities from indirect catastrophic injuries. NCAA, <i>Football
Injuries: Data From the 2004/05 to 2008/09 Seasons, available at</i> http://

While acknowledging that these considerations are relevant to the <i>Comedy III</i>
analysis, the majority says EA's use of realistic likenesses demonstrates that
it sees �value in having an avatar designed to mimic each individual player.�
Majority op. at 1276 n. 7. But the same is true of any right of publicity case.
The defendants in <i>Winter</i> saw value in using comic book characters that
resembled the Winter brothers. Andy Warhol&#8212;whose portraits were discussed
in <i>Comedy III</i>&#8212;saw value in using images of celebrities such as
Marilyn Monroe. In those cases, the products' marketability derives primarily
from the creative elements, not from a pure commercial exploitation of a
celebrity image. The same is true of <i>NCAA Football.</i></p>
