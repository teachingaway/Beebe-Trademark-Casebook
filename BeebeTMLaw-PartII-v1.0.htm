<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this Part, we consider the infringement of trademark
rights under certain sections of the Lanham Act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>� 32, 15 U.S.C. � 1114 (likelihood of confusion with respect to
registered marks)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>� 43(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) (likelihood of confusion with
respect to registered or unregistered marks)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>� 43(c), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c) (likelihood of dilution with respect
to registered or unregistered marks)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>� 43(d), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d) (�cybersquatting� of registered or
unregistered marks)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the test for likelihood of confusion under � 32 is
now essentially the same as the test for likelihood of confusion under � 43(a),
and courts often cite to case law under one section interchangeably with case
law under the other.&nbsp; When owners of registered marks plead likelihood of
confusion, they typically do so under both � 32 and � 43(a) in the event that
some defect is discovered in their registration.&nbsp; Such plaintiffs may also
plead under both sections in order to avail themselves of the slightly broader
language of � 43(a), though, again, courts typically treat � 32 and
�&nbsp;43(a) as essentially interchangeable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courts have set forth the elements of a trademark
infringement claim in a variety of ways.&nbsp; For example, with respect to a
claim based on a likelihood of confusion under either or both of � 32 and �
43(a), courts have stated:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>�[T]o succeed in a Lanham Act suit for trademark infringement, a
plaintiff has two obstacles to overcome: the plaintiff must prove that its mark
is entitled to protection and, even more important, that the defendant's use of
its own mark will likely cause confusion with plaintiff's mark.� <i>Gruner +
Jahr USA Publ'g v. Meredith Corp</i>., 991 F.2d 1072, 1074 (2d Cir.1993).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>�To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1114, a party must prove: (1) that it has a protectible
ownership interest in the mark; and (2) that the defendant�s use of the mark is
likely to cause consumer confusion.�&nbsp; <i>Network Automation, Inc. v.
Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc</i>., 638 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2011)
(citations omitted).</p>

</span></span>�To establish trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, a
plaintiff must prove: (1) that it owns a valid mark; (2) that the defendant
used the mark �in commerce� and without plaintiff�s authorization; (3) that the
defendant used the mark (or an imitation of it) �in connection with the sale,
offering for sale, distribution, or advertising� of goods or services; and (4)
that the defendant�s use of the mark is likely to confuse consumers.� <i>Rosetta

style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>�Both infringement and false designation of origin have five
elements. To prevail under either cause of action, the trademark holder must
prove: (1) that it possesses a mark; (2) that the [opposing party] used the
mark; (3) that the [opposing party's] use of the mark occurred �in commerce�;
(4) that the [opposing party] used the mark �in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, distribution, or advertising� of goods or services; and (5) that the
[opposing party] used the mark in a manner likely to confuse consumers.� Lamparello
v. Falwell, 420 F.3d 309, 313 (4th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). </p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Though the enumerations vary in their level of detail,
these statements of the elements of a likelihood of confusion claim are all
essentially the same. The plaintiff must prove that (1) it possesses exclusive
rights in a mark and (2) the defendant has infringed those exclusive
rights.&nbsp; Our focus in Part II was on the first of these two basic
elements&#8212;whether there is a property right.&nbsp; Our focus in this Part
is on the second of these elements&#8212;whether that right has been infringed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We begin in Part II.A by reviewing the requirement that, in
order to be liable for trademark infringement, a defendant must �use in
commerce� the plaintiff�s mark �in connection with the sale�of any goods or
services.�&nbsp; We then turn in Part II.B to forms of infringement that are
based on the likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source or sponsorship
of the defendant�s goods.&nbsp; In Part II.C, we consider forms of infringement
that are not based on consumer confusion, most notably trademark
dilution.&nbsp; In Part II.D, we turn to forms of relief for cybersquatting.&nbsp;
Finally, in Part II.E, we review the doctrine of secondary liability in
trademark law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc392164803"><a name="_Toc388442212">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Actionable Use Requirement</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Part I.C above, we addressed the requirement that a
trademark owner �use in commerce� the mark in order to establish rights in the
mark.&nbsp; Here, we consider the �use in commerce� requirement as applied not
to owners, but to unauthorized users.&nbsp; We do so because of the statutory
language, shown in italics, in Lanham Act �&nbsp;32 and �&nbsp;43(a):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lanham Act � 32, 15 U.S.C. � 1114</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) Any person who shall, without the consent of the
registrant-- (a) <i>use in commerce</i> any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or
colorable imitation of a registered mark <i>in connection with the sale,
offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services</i> on
or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive�shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for
the remedies hereinafter provided.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Lanham Act � 43(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) Any person who, <i>on or in connection with any goods
or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce</i> any word, term,
name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation
of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading
representation of fact, which--(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive�shall be liable in a civil action by any person who
believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Thus, for a defendant to be found liable, � 32 requires
a showing that the defendant made a �use in commerce� of the plaintiff�s mark �in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of
any goods or services,<i>�</i> and � 43(a) requires that the defendant �use[]
in commerce� the plaintiff�s mark �in connection </p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>with any goods or services, or any container for goods.�&nbsp;
(Lanham Act � 43(c), addressing trademark dilution, similarly requires a
showing that the defendant made a �use of a mark or trade name in commerce.� 15
U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1).&nbsp; See Comment 2 at the conclusion of Part II.A.2 for a
discussion of this language). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courts have analyzed the �use in commerce� language
differently from how they�ve analyzed the �in connection with� language.&nbsp;
We turn first to the question of defendant�s �use in commerce.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392164804"><a name="_Toc388442213">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant�s
�Use in Commerce�</a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is clear enough that the various infringement sections of
the Lanham Act all require a showing that the defendant has made a �use in
commerce,� if only to satisfy the constitutional limitation on Congressional
power,&nbsp; but what constitutes such a �use in commerce�?&nbsp; As we
discussed in Part I.C, Lanham Act � 45, 15 U.S.C. � 1127, offers a definition
of this phrase:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The term �use in commerce� means the bona fide use of a
mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in
a mark. For purposes of this Act, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in
commerce&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) on goods when--</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(A) it is placed in any manner on
the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the
tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such
placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their
sale, and</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(B)the goods are sold or
transported in commerce, and </p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or
advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce, or the
services are rendered in more than one State or in the United States and a
foreign country and the person rendering the services is engaged in commerce in
connection with the services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The obvious problem, however, is that this definition
appears to describe the kind of �use in commerce� necessary to establish
trademark rights rather than the kind of �use in commerce� necessary to
infringe those rights.&nbsp; In the opinion below, <i>Rescuecom Corp. v. Google
Inc</i>., 562 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2009), the Second Circuit went to great lengths
to arrive at this rather straightforward understanding of the � 45 definition
of �use in commerce.�&nbsp; It felt the need thoroughly to consider the issue
because in a previous opinion, <i>1&#8211;800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com,
Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 400 (2d Cir.2005), it had somehow failed to recognize that �
45 was designed to address only the conduct of trademark owners rather than
that of trademark infringers.&nbsp; <i>Rescuecom</i> became one long, extended
effort in trying to maintain appearances.&nbsp; In reading through <i>Rescuecom</i>,
consider the following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>What is the underlying policy concern that is animating this technical,
even rather pedantic debate about the meaning of �use in commerce�?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Has the Second Circuit explicitly overruled its previous decision
in <i>1-800 Contacts</i>?&nbsp; What is the status of <i>Rescuecom</i>�s
Appendix?&nbsp; What does it mean that, as the <i>Rescuecom</i> opinion
explains, �[t]he judges of the <i>1&#8211;800</i> panel have read this Appendix
and have authorized us to state that they agree with it�?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If a search engine user enters the word �Apple� and receives
advertisements for Android phones, has the search engine itself made a �use in
commerce� of Apple�s mark?&nbsp; Asked perhaps another way, if a restaurant has
given written instructions to its employees to respond to a consumer�s order
for Pepsi with the statement �We offer Coke�, has the restaurant made a �use in
commerce� of the Pepsi mark that could be the basis for an infringement cause
of action?</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>LEVAL, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>1</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appeal by Plaintiff Rescuecom Corp. from a judgment
of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York
(Mordue, <i>Chief Judge)</i> dismissing its action against Google, Inc., under
Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
Rescuecom's Complaint alleges that Google is liable under �� 32 and 43 of the
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �� 1114 &amp; 1125, for infringement, false designation
of origin, and dilution of Rescuecom's eponymous trademark. The district court
believed the dismissal of the action was compelled by our holding in <i>1&#8211;800
Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com, Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 400 (2d Cir.2005) (�<i>1&#8211;800</i>�),
because, according to the district court's understanding of that opinion, Rescuecom
failed to allege that Google's use of its mark was a �use in commerce� within
the meaning of � 45 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1127. We believe this
misunderstood the holding of <i>1&#8211;800.</i> While we express no view as to
whether Rescuecom can prove a Lanham Act violation, an actionable claim is
adequately alleged in its pleadings. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment
dismissing the action and remand for further proceedings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>2</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As this appeal follows the grant of a motion to
dismiss, we must take as true the facts alleged in the Complaint and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of Rescuecom. <i>Lentell v. Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., Inc.,</i> 396 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2005). Rescuecom is a national
computer service franchising company that offers on-site computer services and
sales. Rescuecom conducts a substantial amount of business over the Internet
and receives between 17,000 to 30,000 visitors to its website each month. It
also advertises over the Internet, using many web-based services, including
those offered by Google. Since 1998, �Rescuecom� has been a registered federal trademark,
and there is no dispute as to its validity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>3</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Google operates a popular Internet search engine,
which users access by visiting www. google. com. Using Google's website, a
person searching for the website of a particular entity in trade (or simply for
information about it) can enter that entity's name or trademark into Google's
search engine and launch a search. Google's proprietary system responds to such
a search request in two ways. First, Google provides a list of links to
websites, ordered in what Google deems to be of descending relevance to the
user's search terms based on its proprietary algorithms. Google's search engine
assists the public not only in obtaining information about a provider, but also
in purchasing products and services. If a prospective purchaser, looking for
goods or services of a particular provider, enters the provider's trademark as
a search term on Google's website and clicks to activate a search, within
seconds, the Google search engine will provide on the searcher's computer
screen a link to the webpage maintained by that provider (as well as a host of
other links to sites that Google's program determines to be relevant to the
search term entered). By clicking on the link of the provider, the searcher
will be directed to the provider's website, where the searcher can obtain
information supplied by the provider about its products and services and can
perhaps also make purchases from the provider by placing orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>4</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The second way Google responds to a search request
is by showing context-based advertising. When a searcher uses Google's search
engine by submitting a search term, Google may place advertisements on the
user's screen. Google will do so if an advertiser, having determined that its
ad is likely to be of interest to a searcher who enters the particular term,
has purchased from Google the placement of its ad on the screen of the searcher
who entered that search term. What Google places on the searcher's screen is
more than simply an advertisement. It is also a link to the advertiser's
website, so that in response to such an ad, if the searcher clicks on the link,
he will open the advertiser's website, which offers not only additional
information about the advertiser, but also perhaps the option to purchase the
goods and services of the advertiser over the Internet. Google uses at least
two programs to offer such context-based links: AdWords and Keyword Suggestion
Tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>5</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> AdWords is Google's program through which
advertisers purchase terms (or keywords). When entered as a search term, the
keyword triggers the appearance of the advertiser's ad and link. An
advertiser's purchase of a particular term causes the advertiser's ad and link
to be displayed on the user's screen whenever a searcher launches a Google
search based on the purchased search term.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[1]</span></span></span></a>
Advertisers pay Google based on the number of times Internet users �click� on
the advertisement, so as to link to the advertiser's website. For example,
using Google's AdWords, Company Y, a company engaged in the business of furnace
repair, can cause Google to display its advertisement and link whenever a user
of Google launches a search based on the search term, �furnace repair.� Company
Y can also cause its ad and link to appear whenever a user searches for the
term �Company X,� a competitor of Company Y in the furnace repair business.
Thus, whenever a searcher interested in purchasing furnace repair services from
Company X launches a search of the term X (Company X's trademark), an ad and
link would appear on the searcher's screen, inviting the searcher to the
furnace repair services of X's competitor, Company Y. And if the searcher
clicked on Company Y's link, Company Y's website would open on the searcher's
screen, and the searcher might be able to order or purchase Company Y's furnace
repair services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>6</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to AdWords, Google also employs Keyword
Suggestion Tool, a program that recommends keywords to advertisers to be
purchased. The program is designed to improve the effectiveness of advertising
by helping advertisers identify keywords related to their area of commerce,
resulting in the placement of their ads before users who are likely to be
responsive to it. Thus, continuing the example given above, if Company Y
employed Google's Keyword Suggestion Tool, the Tool might suggest to Company Y
that it purchase not only the term �furnace repair� but also the term �X,� its
competitor's brand name and trademark, so that Y's ad would appear on the
screen of a searcher who searched Company X's trademark, seeking Company X's
website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>7</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Once an advertiser buys a particular keyword,
Google links the keyword to that advertiser's advertisement. The advertisements
consist of a combination of content and a link to the advertiser's webpage.
Google displays these advertisements on the search result page either in the
right margin or in a horizontal band immediately above the column of relevance-based
search results. These advertisements are generally associated with a label,
which says �sponsored link.� Rescuecom alleges, however, that a user might
easily be misled to believe that the advertisements which appear on the screen
are in fact part of the relevance-based search result and that the appearance
of a competitor's ad and link in response to a searcher's search for Rescuecom
is likely to cause trademark confusion as to affiliation, origin, sponsorship,
or approval of service. This can occur, according to the Complaint, because
Google fails to label the ads in a manner which would clearly identify them as
purchased ads rather than search results. The Complaint alleges that when the
sponsored links appear in a horizontal bar at the top of the search results,
they may appear to the searcher to be the first, and therefore the most relevant,
entries responding to the search, as opposed to paid advertisements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>8</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Google's objective in its AdWords and Keyword
Suggestion Tool programs is to sell keywords to advertisers. Rescuecom alleges
that Google makes 97% of its revenue from selling advertisements through its
AdWords program. Google therefore has an economic incentive to increase the
number of advertisements and links that appear for every term entered into its
search engine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>9</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Many of Rescuecom's competitors advertise on the
Internet. Through its Keyword Suggestion Tool, Google has recommended the
Rescuecom trademark to Rescuecom's competitors as a search term to be
purchased. Rescuecom's competitors, some responding to Google's recommendation,
have purchased Rescuecom's trademark as a keyword in Google's AdWords program,
so that whenever a user launches a search for the term �Rescuecom,� seeking to
be connected to Rescuecom's website, the competitors' advertisement and link
will appear on the searcher's screen. This practice allegedly allows
Rescuecom's competitors to deceive and divert users searching for Rescuecom's
website. According to Rescuecom's allegations, when a Google user launches a
search for the term �Rescuecom� because the searcher wishes to purchase
Rescuecom's services, links to websites of its competitors will appear on the
searcher's screen in a manner likely to cause the searcher to believe
mistakenly that a competitor's advertisement (and website link) is sponsored
by, endorsed by, approved by, or affiliated with Rescuecom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>10</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The District Court granted Google's 12(b)(6) motion
and dismissed Rescuecom's claims. The court believed that our <i>1&#8211;800</i>
decision compels the conclusion that Google's allegedly infringing activity
does not involve use of Rescuecom's mark in commerce, which is an essential
element of an action under the Lanham Act. The district court explained its
decision saying that even if Google employed Rescuecom's mark in a manner
likely to cause confusion or deceive searchers into believing that competitors
are affiliated with Rescuecom and its mark, so that they believe the services
of Rescuecom's competitors are those of Rescuecom, Google's actions are not a
�use in commerce� under the Lanham Act because the competitor's advertisements
triggered by Google's programs did not exhibit Rescuecom's trademark. The court
rejected the argument that Google �used� Rescuecom's mark in recommending and
selling it as a keyword to trigger competitor's advertisements because the
court read <i>1&#8211;800</i> to compel the conclusion that this was an
internal use and therefore cannot be a �use in commerce� under the Lanham Act.</p>

Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>I. Google's Use of Rescuecom's Mark Was a �Use in
Commerce�</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>12</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our court ruled in <i>1&#8211;800</i> that a
complaint fails to state a claim under the Lanham Act unless it alleges that
the defendant has made �use in commerce� of the plaintiff's trademark as the
term �use in commerce� is defined in 15 U.S.C. � 1127. The district court
believed that this case was on all fours with <i>1&#8211;800,</i> and that its
dismissal was required for the same reasons as given in <i>1&#8211;800.</i> We
believe the cases are materially different. The allegations of Rescuecom's
complaint adequately plead a use in commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>13</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>1&#8211;800,</i> the plaintiff alleged that
the defendant infringed the plaintiff's trademark through its proprietary
software, which the defendant freely distributed to computer users who would
download and install the program on their computer. The program provided
contextually relevant advertising to the user by generating pop-up advertisements
to the user depending on the website or search term the user entered in his
browser. <i>Id.</i> at 404&#8211;05. For example, if a user typed �eye care�
into his browser, the defendant's program would randomly display a pop-up
advertisement of a company engaged in the field of eye care. Similarly, if the
searcher launched a search for a particular company engaged in eye care, the
defendant's program would display the pop-up ad of a company associated with
eye care. <i>See id.</i> at 412. The pop-up ad appeared in a separate browser
window from the website the user accessed, and the defendant's brand was
displayed in the window frame surrounding the ad, so that there was no
confusion as to the nature of the pop-up as an advertisement, nor as to the
fact that the defendant, not the trademark owner, was responsible for
displaying the ad, in response to the particular term searched. <i>Id.</i> at
405.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>14</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Sections 32 and 43 of the Act, which we also refer
to by their codified designations, 15 U.S.C. �� 1114 &amp; 1125, <i>inter alia,</i>
impose liability for unpermitted �use in commerce� of another's mark which is
�likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,� � 1114, �as to
the affiliation ... or as to the origin, sponsorship or approval of his or her
goods [or] services ... by another person.� � 1125(a)(1)(A). The <i>1&#8211;800</i>
opinion looked to the definition of the term �use in commerce� provided in � 45
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1127. That definition provides in part that �a mark
shall be deemed to be in use in commerce ... (2) on services when it is used or
displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered
in commerce.� 15 U.S.C. � 1127.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[2]</span></span></span></a>
Our court found that the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant made a
�use in commerce� of the plaintiff's mark, within that definition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>15</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the outset, we note two significant aspects of
our holding in <i>1&#8211;800,</i> which distinguish it from the present case.
A key element of our court's decision in <i>1&#8211;800</i> was that under the
plaintiff's allegations, the defendant did not use, reproduce, or display the
plaintiff's mark <i>at all.</i> The search term that was alleged to trigger the
pop-up ad was the plaintiff's <i>website address. 1&#8211;800</i> noted,
notwithstanding the similarities between the website address and the mark, that
the website address was not used or claimed by the plaintiff as a trademark.
Thus, the transactions alleged to be infringing were not transactions involving
use of the plaintiff's trademark. <i>Id.</i> at 408&#8211;09.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[3]</span></span></span></a> <i>1&#8211;800</i> suggested
in dictum that is highly relevant to our case that had the defendant used the
plaintiff's <i>trademark</i> as the trigger to pop-up an advertisement, such
conduct might, depending on other elements, have been actionable. 414 F.3d at
409 &amp; n. 11.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>16</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, as an alternate basis for its decision, <i>1&#8211;800</i>
explained why the defendant's program, which might randomly trigger pop-up
advertisements upon a searcher's input of the plaintiff's website address, did
not constitute a �use in commerce,� as defined in � 1127. <i>Id.</i> at
408&#8211;09. In explaining why the plaintiff's mark was not �used or displayed
in the sale or advertising of services,� <i>1&#8211;800</i> pointed out that,
under the defendant's program, advertisers could not request or purchase
keywords to trigger their ads. <i>Id.</i> at 409, 412. Even if an advertiser
wanted to display its advertisement to a searcher using the plaintiff's
trademark as a search term, the defendant's program did not offer this
possibility. In fact, the defendant �did not disclose the proprietary contents
of [its] directory to its advertising clients....� <i>Id.</i> at 409. In
addition to not selling trademarks of others to its customers to trigger these
ads, the defendant did not �otherwise manipulate which category-related advertisement
will pop up in response to any particular terms on the internal directory.� <i>Id.</i>
at 411. The display of a particular advertisement was controlled by the
category associated with the website or keyword, rather than the website or
keyword itself. The defendant's program relied upon categorical associations
such as �eye care� to select a pop-up ad randomly from a predefined list of ads
appropriate to that category. To the extent that an advertisement for a
competitor of the plaintiff was displayed when a user opened the plaintiff's
website, the trigger to display the ad was not based on the defendant's sale or
recommendation of a particular trademark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>17</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The present case contrasts starkly with those
important aspects of the <i>1&#8211;800</i> decision. First, in contrast to <i>1&#8211;800,</i>
where we emphasized that the defendant made no use whatsoever of the
plaintiff's trademark, here what Google is recommending and selling to its
advertisers is Rescuecom's trademark. Second, in contrast with the facts of <i>1&#8211;800</i>
where the defendant did not �use or display,� much less sell, trademarks as
search terms to its advertisers, here Google displays, offers, and sells
Rescuecom's mark to Google's advertising customers when selling its advertising
services. In addition, Google encourages the purchase of Rescuecom's mark
through its Keyword Suggestion Tool. Google's utilization of Rescuecom's mark
fits literally within the terms specified by 15 U.S.C. � 1127. According to the
Complaint, Google uses and sells Rescuecom's mark �in the sale ... of [Google's
advertising] services ... rendered in commerce.� � 1127.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>18</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Google, supported by amici, argues that <i>1&#8211;800</i>
suggests that the inclusion of a trademark in an internal computer directory
cannot constitute trademark use. Several district court decisions in this
Circuit appear to have reached this conclusion. <i>See e.g., S &amp; L
Vitamins, Inc. v. Australian Gold, Inc.,</i> 521 F.Supp.2d 188, 199&#8211;202
(E.D.N.Y.2007) (holding that use of a trademark in metadata did not constitute
trademark use within the meaning of the Lanham Act because the use �is strictly
internal and not communicated to the public�); <i>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v.
Mediplan Health Consulting, Inc.,</i> 425 F.Supp.2d 402, 415 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (holding
that the internal use of a keyword to trigger advertisements did not qualify as
trademark use). This over-reads the <i>1&#8211;800</i> decision. First,
regardless of whether Google's use of Rescuecom's mark in its internal search
algorithm could constitute an actionable trademark use, Google's recommendation
and sale of Rescuecom's mark to its advertising customers are not internal
uses. Furthermore, <i>1&#8211;800</i> did not imply that use of a trademark in
a software program's internal directory precludes a finding of trademark use.
Rather, influenced by the fact that the defendant was not using the plaintiff's
trademark at all, much less using it as the basis of a commercial transaction,
the court asserted that the particular use before it did not constitute a use
in commerce. <i>See 1&#8211;800,</i> 414 F.3d at 409&#8211;12. We did not imply
in <i>1&#8211;800</i> that an alleged infringer's use of a trademark in an
internal software program insulates the alleged infringer from a charge of
infringement, no matter how likely the use is to cause confusion in the
marketplace. If we were to adopt Google and its amici's argument, the operators
of search engines would be free to use trademarks in ways designed to deceive
and cause consumer confusion.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[4]</span></span></span></a>
This is surely neither within the intention nor the letter of the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>19</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Google and its amici contend further that its use
of the Rescuecom trademark is no different from that of a retail vendor who
uses �product placement� to allow one vender to benefit from a competitors'
name recognition. An example of product placement occurs when a store-brand
generic product is placed next to a trademarked product to induce a customer
who specifically sought out the trademarked product to consider the typically
less expensive, generic brand as an alternative. <i>See 1&#8211;800,</i> 414
F.3d at 411. Google's argument misses the point. From the fact that proper,
non-deceptive product placement does not result in liability under the Lanham
Act, it does not follow that the label �product placement� is a magic shield
against liability, so that even a deceptive plan of product placement designed
to confuse consumers would similarly escape liability. It is not by reason of
absence of a use of a mark in commerce that benign product placement escapes
liability; it escapes liability because it is a benign practice which does not
cause a likelihood of consumer confusion. In contrast, if a retail seller were
to be paid by an off-brand purveyor to arrange product display and delivery in
such a way that customers seeking to purchase a famous brand would receive the
off-brand, believing they had gotten the brand they were seeking, we see no
reason to believe the practice would escape liability merely because it could
claim the mantle of �product placement.� The practices attributed to Google by
the Complaint, which at this stage we must accept as true, are significantly
different from benign product placement that does not violate the Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>20</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Unlike the practices discussed in <i>1&#8211;800,</i>
the practices here attributed to Google by Rescuecom's complaint are that
Google has made use in commerce of Rescuecom's mark. Needless to say, a
defendant must do more than use another's mark in commerce to violate the
Lanham Act. The gist of a Lanham Act violation is an unauthorized use, which
�is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the
affiliation, ... or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of ... goods
[or] services.� <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a); <i>Estee Lauder Inc. v. The
Gap, Inc.,</i> 108 F.3d 1503, 1508&#8211;09 (2d Cir.1997). We have no idea
whether Rescuecom can prove that Google's use of Rescuecom's trademark in its
AdWords program causes likelihood of confusion or mistake. Rescuecom has
alleged that it does, in that would-be purchasers (or explorers) of its
services who search for its website on Google are misleadingly directed to the
ads and websites of its competitors in a manner which leads them to believe
mistakenly that these ads or websites are sponsored by, or affiliated with Rescuecom.
This is particularly so, Rescuecom alleges, when the advertiser's link appears
in a horizontal band at the top of the list of search results in a manner which
makes it appear to be the most relevant search result and not an advertisement.
What Rescuecom alleges is that by the manner of Google's display of sponsored
links of competing brands in response to a search for Rescuecom's brand name
(which fails adequately to identify the sponsored link as an advertisement,
rather than a relevant search result), Google creates a likelihood of consumer
confusion as to trademarks. If the searcher sees a different brand name as the
top entry in response to the search for �Rescuecom,� the searcher is likely to
believe mistakenly that the different name which appears is affiliated with the
brand name sought in the search and will not suspect, because the fact is not
adequately signaled by Google's presentation, that this is not the most
relevant response to the search. Whether Google's actual practice is in fact
benign or confusing is not for us to judge at this time. We consider at the
12(b)(6) stage only what is alleged in the Complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>21</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>23</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>1&#8211;800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com,
Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 400 (2d Cir.2005) ( �<i>1&#8211;800</i>�), our court
followed the reasoning of two district court opinions from other circuits, <i>U&#8211;Haul
Int'l, Inc. v. WhenU.com, Inc.,</i> 279 F.Supp.2d 723 (E.D.Va.2003) and <i>Wells
Fargo &amp; Co., v. WhenU.com, Inc.,</i> 293 F.Supp.2d 734 (E.D.Mich.2003),
which dismissed suits on virtually identical claims against the same defendant.
Those two district courts ruled that the defendant's conduct was not actionable
under �� 32 &amp; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � � 1114 &amp; 1125(a),
even assuming that conduct caused likelihood of trademark confusion, because
the defendant had not made a �use in commerce� of the plaintiff's mark, within
the definition of that phrase set forth in � 45 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1127. In quoting definitional language of � 1127 that is crucial to their
holdings, however, <i>U&#8211;Haul</i> and <i>Wells Fargo</i> overlooked and
omitted portions of the statutory text which make clear that the definition provided
in � 1127 was not intended by Congress to apply in the manner that the decisions
assumed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>24</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our court's ruling in <i>1&#8211;800</i> that the
Plaintiff had failed to plead a viable claim under �� 1114 &amp; 1125(a) was
justified by numerous good reasons and was undoubtedly the correct result. In
addition to the questionable ground derived from the district court opinions,
which had overlooked key statutory text, our court's opinion cited other highly
persuasive reasons for dismissing the action&#8212;among them that the
plaintiff did not claim a trademark in the term that served as the basis for
the claim of infringement; nor did the defendant's actions cause any likelihood
of confusion, as is crucial for such a claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>25</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We proceed to explain how the district courts in <i>U&#8211;Haul</i>
and <i>Wells Fargo</i> adopted reasoning which overlooked crucial statutory
text that was incompatible with their ultimate conclusion�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>Deleted here is the court�s lengthy discussion of the
history of the phrase �use in commerce� in the Lanham Act and, in particular, of
the 1988 amendment to � 1127�s definition of �use in commerce�</i>].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>The Interpretation of � 1127's Definition of �Use in
Commerce � with Respect to Alleged Infringers</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>26</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In light of the preceding discussion, how should
courts today interpret the definition of �use in commerce� set forth in 15
U.S.C. � 1127, with respect to acts of infringement prescribed by �� 1114 and
1125(a)? The foregoing review of the evolution of the Act seems to us to make
clear that Congress did not intend that this definition apply to the sections
of the Lanham Act which define infringing conduct. The definition was rather
intended to apply to the sections which used the phrase in prescribing
eligibility for registration and for the Act's protections. However, Congress
does not enact intentions. It enacts statutes. And the process of enacting legislation
is of such complexity that understandably the words of statutes do not always
conform perfectly to the motivating intentions. This can create for courts
difficult problems of interpretation. Because pertinent amendments were passed
in 1962 and in 1988, and because the 1988 amendment did not change the
pre-existing parts of the definition in � 1127, but merely added a sentence, it
seems useful to approach the question of the current meaning in two steps.
First, what did this definition mean between 1962 and 1988&#8212;prior to the
1988 amendment? Then, how was the meaning changed by the 1988 amendment?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>27</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Between 1962 and 1988, notwithstanding the
likelihood shown by the legislative history that Congress <i>intended</i> the
definition to apply only to registration and qualification for benefits and not
to infringement, a court addressing the issue nonetheless would probably have
concluded that the section applied to alleged infringement, as well. Section
1127 states that its definitions apply �unless the contrary is plainly apparent
from the context.� One who considered the question at the time might well have
wondered why Congress would have provided this restrictive definition for acts
of trademark infringement with the consequence that deceptive and confusing
uses of another's mark with respect to goods would escape liability if the
conduct did not include the placement of the mark on goods or their containers,
displays, or sale documents, and with respect to services if the conduct did
not include the use or display of the mark in the sale or advertising of the
services. It is easy to imagine perniciously confusing conduct involving
another's mark which does not involve placement of the mark in the manner
specified in the definition. Nonetheless, in spite of those doubts, one could
not have said it was �plainly apparent from the context� that those restrictions
did not apply to sections defining infringement. In all probability, therefore,
a court construing the provision between 1962 and 1988 would have concluded
that in order to be actionable under �� 1114 or 1125(a) the allegedly
infringing conduct needed to include placement of the mark in the manner
specified in the definition of �use in commerce� in � 1127.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>28</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The next question is how the meaning of the � 1127
definition was changed by the 1988 amendment, which, as noted, left the
preexisting language about placement of the mark unchanged, but added a prior
sentence requiring that a �use in commerce� be �a bona fide use in the ordinary
course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.� While it is
�plainly apparent from the context� that the new first sentence cannot
reasonably apply to statutory sections defining infringing conduct, the
question remains whether the addition of this new sentence changed the meaning
of the second sentence of the definition without changing its words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>29</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We see at least two possible answers to the
question, neither of which is entirely satisfactory. One interpretation would
be that, by adding the new first sentence, Congress changed the meaning of the
second sentence of the definition to conform to the new first sentence, without
altering the words. The language of the definition, which, prior to the
addition of the new first sentence, would have been construed to apply both to
sections defining infringement, and to sections specifying eligibility for
registration, would change its meaning, despite the absence of any change in
its words, so that the entire definition now no longer applied to the sections
defining infringement. Change of meaning without change of words is obviously
problematic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>30</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The alternative solution would be to interpret the
two sentences of the statutory definition as of different scope. The second
sentence of the definition, which survived the 1988 amendment unchanged, would
retain its prior meaning and continue to apply as before the amendment to
sections defining infringement, as well as to sections relating to a mark
owner's eligibility for registration and for enjoyment of the protections of the
Act. The new first sentence, which plainly was not intended to apply to
infringements, would apply only to sections in the latter category&#8212;those
relating to an owner's eligibility to register its mark and enjoy the Act's
protection. Under this interpretation, liability for infringement under �� 1114
and 1125(a) would continue, as before 1988, to require a showing of the
infringer's placement of another's mark in the manner specified in the second
sentence of the � 1127 definition. It would not require a showing that the
alleged infringer made �bona fide use of the mark in the ordinary course of
trade, and not merely to reserve a right in the mark.� On the other hand,
eligibility of mark owners for registration and for the protections of the Act
would depend on their showing compliance with the requirements of both
sentences of the definition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'>31</span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We recognize that neither of the two available
solutions is altogether satisfactory. Each has advantages and disadvantages. At
least for this Circuit, especially given our prior <i>1&#8211;800</i>
precedent, which applied the second sentence of the definition to infringement,
the latter solution, according a different scope of application to the two
sentences of the definition, seems to be preferable.<a href="#_ftn6"

read this Appendix and have authorized us to state that they agree with it. At
the same time we note that the discussion in this Appendix does not affect the
result of this case. We assumed in the body of the opinion, in accordance with
the holding of <i>1&#8211;800,</i> that the requirements of the second sentence
of the definition of �use in commerce� in � 1127 apply to infringing conduct
and found that such use in commerce was adequately pleaded. The discussion in
this Appendix is therefore dictum and not a binding opinion of the court. It
would be helpful for Congress to study and clear up this ambiguity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tamasha
surrounding the question of the meaning of �use in commerce� when applied to
the defendant�s conduct, particularly in the search engine context, appears now
to have ended.&nbsp; In <i>Network Automation Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts
Inc</i>., 638 F.3d 1137 (9th Cir. 2011), the plaintiff sought a declaration of
non-infringement for its purchase of search engine keywords, among them the
defendant�s trademark, that triggered sponsored links advertising the
plaintiff�s services.&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit devoted one short paragraph to
the issue of �use in commerce� by the declaratory plaintiff.&nbsp; The <i>Network
Automation</i> court simply held: �We now agree with the Second Circuit that
such use is a �use in commerce� under the Lanham Act. <i>See Rescuecom Corp. v.
Google Inc</i>., 562 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir.2009) (holding that Google�s sale of
trademarks as search engine keywords is a use in commerce).� <i>Id</i>. at

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We now turn to what has proven to be a far more significant
threshold requirement for liability in U.S. trademark law, often called the
�commercial use� requirement.&nbsp; This is the requirement that, to be found
liable, the defendant must make a use of the plaintiff�s mark �in connection
with the sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services�, Lanham Act
� 32(1)(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a), or �<span class=ptext->in connection with

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;In <i>Bosley Medical Institute, Inc. v. Kremer</i>,
403 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2005), the defendant operated a �gripe site� at www.BosleyMedical.com
attacking the plaintiff and its male pattern baldness treatments.&nbsp; The
defendant claimed that he did not make a use of the plaintiff�s mark �in
connection with the sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or

infringement liability?&nbsp; Can you imagine situations where such defendants
may nevertheless cause confusion as to the source or affiliation of the

In a bald-faced effort to get even, Kremer started a website at

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Michael Kremer is a dissatisfied former patient of
Bosley. Unhappy with the results of a hair replacement procedure performed by a
Bosley physician in Seattle, Washington, he filed a medical malpractice lawsuit
against Bosley Medical in 1994. That suit was eventually dismissed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span

www.BosleyMedical.com, the subject of this appeal, as well as the domain name
www.BosleyMedicalViolations.com, which is not challenged by Bosley. Five days
after registering the domain name, Kremer went to Bosley Medical's office in
Beverly Hills, California and delivered a two-page letter to Dr. Bosley,
Founder and President of Bosley Medical. The first page read:</p>

His site summarizes the Los Angeles County District Attorney's 1996
investigative findings about Bosley, and allows visitors to view the entire
document. It also contains other information that is highly critical of Bosley.
Kremer earns no revenue from the website and no goods or services are sold on
the website. There are no links to any of Bosley's competitors' websites.
BosleyMedical.com does link to Kremer's sister site, BosleyMedicalViolations.com,
which links to a newsgroup entitled alt.baldspot, which in turn contains
advertisements for companies that compete with Bosley. BosleyMedical.com also

amended the complaint.</p>

<p class=Centered>III. Analysis</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>A. Trademark Infringement and Dilution Claims</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Trademark Act of 1946 (�Lanham Act�) prohibits
uses of trademarks, trade names, and trade dress that are likely to cause
confusion about the source of a product or service. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. ��
1114, 1125(a). In 1996, Congress amended � 43 of the Lanham Act to provide a
remedy for the dilution of a famous mark. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Infringement claims are subject to a commercial use
requirement. The infringement section of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1114,
states that any person who �use[s] in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit,
copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,
offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or
in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive ...� can be held liable for such use. 15 U.S.C. �
1114(1)(a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1996, Congress expanded the scope of federal
trademark law when it enacted the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (�FTDA�). The
FTDA allows the �owner of a famous mark� to obtain �an injunction against
another person's <i>commercial use in commerce</i> of a mark or trade name....�
15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1) (emphasis added). While the meaning of the term
�commercial use in commerce� is not entirely clear, we have interpreted the
language to be roughly analogous to the �in connection with� sale of goods and
services requirement of the infringement statute. <i>See Mattel, Inc. v. MCA
Records, Inc.,</i> 296 F.3d 894, 903 (9th Cir.2002) (�Although this statutory
language is ungainly, its meaning seems clear: It refers to a use of a famous
and distinctive mark to sell goods other than those produced or authorized by
the mark's owner.�); <i>see also Huthwaite, Inc. v. Sunrise Assisted Living, Inc.,</i>
261 F.Supp.2d 502, 517 (E.D.Va.2003) (holding that the commercial use
requirement of the FTDA is �virtually synonymous with the �in connection with
the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods and
services' requirement� of the Lanham Act).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The inclusion of these requirements in the Lanham
Act serves the Act's purpose: �to secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill
of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among
competing producers.� <i>Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S.
763, 774 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In other
words, the Act is designed to protect consumers who have formed particular
associations with a mark from buying a competing product using the same or
substantially similar mark and to allow the mark holder to distinguish his
product from that of his rivals. <i>See Avery Dennison Corp. v. Sumpton,</i>
189 F.3d 868, 873 (9th Cir.1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Supreme Court has made it clear that trademark
infringement law prevents only unauthorized uses of a trademark in connection
with a commercial transaction in which the trademark is being used to confuse
potential consumers. <i>See Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty,</i> 264 U.S. 359, 368,
44 S.Ct. 350, 68 L.Ed. 731 (1924) (�A trade-mark only gives the right to
prohibit the use of it so far as to protect the owner's good will against <i>the
sale of another's product as his.</i>� [emphasis added] ); <i>see also
Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S.S. Kresge Co.,</i> 316 U.S. 203,
205, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381 (1942) (explaining that the main purpose of
the Lanham Act is to prevent the use of identical or similar marks in a way
that confuses the public about the actual source of goods and services).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As the Second Circuit held, �[t]he Lanham Act seeks
to prevent consumer confusion that enables a seller to pass off his goods as
the goods of another.... [T]rademark infringement protects only against
mistaken <i>purchasing decisions</i> and not against confusion generally.� <i>Lang
v. Ret. Living Publ'g Co., Inc.,</i> 949 F.2d 576, 582&#8211;83 (2d Cir.1991)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a matter of First Amendment law, commercial
speech may be regulated in ways that would be impermissible if the same
regulation were applied to noncommercial expressions. <i>Florida Bar v. Went
For It, Inc.,</i> 515 U.S. 618, 623, 115 S.Ct. 2371, 132 L.Ed.2d 541 (1995).
�The First Amendment may offer little protection for a competitor who labels
its commercial good with a confusingly similar mark, but trademark rights do
not entitle the owner to quash an unauthorized use of the mark by another who
is communicating ideas or expressing points of view.� <i>Mattel,</i> 296 F.3d
at 900(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court ruled that Kremer's use of Bosley's
mark was noncommercial. To reach that conclusion, the court focused on the �use
in commerce� language rather than the �use in connection with the sale of
goods� clause. This approach is erroneous. �Use in commerce� is simply a
jurisdictional predicate to any law passed by Congress under the Commerce
Clause. <i>See Steele v. Bulova Watch Co.,</i> 344 U.S. 280, 283 (1952); <i>OBH,
Inc. v. Spotlight Magazine, Inc.,</i> 86 F.Supp.2d 176, 185 (W.D.N.Y.2000). 15
U.S.C. � 1127 states that �unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the
context ... [t]he word �commerce� means all commerce which may lawfully be
regulated by Congress.� Therefore, the district court should have determined
instead whether Kremer's use was �in connection with a sale of goods or
services� rather than a �use in commerce.� However, we can affirm the district
court's grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record. <i>Lamps
Plus, Inc. v. Seattle Lighting Fixture Co.,</i> 345 F.3d 1140, 1143 (9th
Cir.2003). The question before us, then, boils down to whether Kremer's use of
Bosley Medical as his domain name was �in connection with a sale of goods or
services.� If it was not, then Kremer's use was �noncommercial� and did not
violate the Lanham Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Bosley argues that it has met the commercial use
requirement in three ways. First, it argues that a mark used in an otherwise
noncommercial website or as a domain name for an otherwise noncommercial
website is nonetheless used in connection with goods and services where a user
can click on a link available on that website to reach a commercial site. <i>Nissan
Motor Co. v. Nissan Computer Corp.,</i> 378 F.3d 1002 (9th Cir.2004). However,
Bosley's reliance on <i>Nissan</i> is unfounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Nissan,</i> Nissan Motor Company sued Nissan
Computer Corporation for using the Internet websites www.Nissan.com and
www.Nissan.net. <i>Id.</i> at 1006. In <i>Nissan,</i> however, commercial use
was undisputed, as the core function of the defendant's website was to
advertise his computer business. <i>Id.</i> Additionally, the defendant in <i>Nissan,</i>
like the defendant in <i>Taubman Co. v. Webfeats,</i> 319 F.3d 770&nbsp; (6th
Cir.2003), placed links to other commercial businesses directly on their website.
319 F.3d at 772&#8211;73. Kremer's website contains no commercial links, but
rather contains links to a discussion group, which in turn contains
advertising. This roundabout path to the advertising of others is too
attenuated to render Kremer's site commercial. At no time did Kremer's
BosleyMedical.com site offer for sale any product or service or contain paid
advertisements from any other commercial entity. <i>See TMI, Inc. v. Maxwell,</i>
368 F.3d 433, 435, 438 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that the commercial use
requirement is not satisfied where defendant's site had no outside links).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Bosley also points out that Kremer's site contained
a link to Public Citizen, the public interest group representing Kremer
throughout this litigation. We hold that Kremer's identification of his lawyers
and his provision of a link to same did not transform his noncommercial site
into a commercial one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Bosley's second argument that Kremer's website
satisfies the �in connection with the sale of goods or services� requirement of
the Lanham Act is that Kremer created his website to enable an extortion scheme
in an attempt to profit from registering BosleyMedical.com. In <i>Panavision
International, L.P. v. Toeppen,</i> 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir.1998), this court
held that a defendant's �commercial use was his attempt to sell the trademarks
themselves.� <i>Id.</i> at 1325. Similarly, in <i>Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen,</i>
947 F.Supp. 1227 (N.D.Ill.1996), the court found that �Toeppen's intention to
arbitrage the �intermatic.com� domain name constitute[d] a commercial use.� <i>Id.</i>
at 1239; <i>see also Boston Prof'l Hockey Ass'n, Inc. v. Dallas Cap &amp;
Emblem Mfg., Inc.,</i> 510 F.2d 1004, 1010 (5th Cir.1975) (holding that
trademark law protects the trademark itself, despite the fact that only �a
reproduction of the trademark itself is being sold, unattached to any other
goods or services�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, in this case, there is no evidence that
Kremer was trying to sell the domain name itself. The letter delivered by
Kremer to Bosley's headquarters is a threat to expose negative information
about Bosley on the Internet, but it makes no reference whatsoever to ransoming
Bosley's trademark or to Kremer's use of the mark as a domain name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Bosley argues that it was denied an opportunity to
pursue discovery on commercial use, and had it been allowed to proceed with
discovery, it could further establish that Kremer has attempted to sell the
domain name. However, in opposing Kremer's motion for summary judgment, Bosley
did not make any such objections. Bosley failed to request further discovery
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), but instead moved for summary
judgment itself. Although Bosley's reply brief supporting its own motion for
summary judgment complained about limited discovery in a footnote, Bosley did
not move for leave to take discovery. The district court did not abuse its
discretion in granting the summary judgment without permitting further
discovery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Bosley's third and final argument that it satisfied
the commercial use requirement of the Lanham Act is that Kremer's use of
Bosley's trademark was in connection with <i>Bosley's</i> goods and services.
In other words, Kremer used the mark �in connection with goods and services�
because he prevented users from obtaining the plaintiff's goods and services. <i>See
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney,</i> 263 F.3d 359 (4th
Cir.2001) ( �<i>PETA</i>�). In <i>PETA</i>, defendants created a site that
promoted ideas antithetical to those of the PETA group. <i>Id.</i> at
362&#8211;63. The Fourth Circuit held that the defendant's<b> </b>parody site,
though not having a commercial purpose and not selling any goods or services,
violated the Lanham Act because it �prevented users from obtaining or using
PETA's goods or services.� <i>Id.</i> at 365.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, in <i>PETA</i>, the defendant's website
�provide[d] links to more than 30 commercial operations offering goods and
services.� <i>Id.</i> at 366. To the extent that the <i>PETA</i> court held
that the Lanham Act's commercial use requirement is satisfied because the
defendant's use of the plaintiff's mark as the domain name may deter customers
from reaching the plaintiff's site itself, we respectfully disagree with that
rationale. While it is true that www.BosleyMedical.com is not sponsored by
Bosley Medical, it is just as true that it is <i>about</i> Bosley Medical. The <i>PETA</i>
approach would place most critical, otherwise protected consumer commentary
under the restrictions of the Lanham Act. Other courts have also rejected this
theory as over-expansive. <i>See L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc.,</i>
811 F.2d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also Ford Motor Co. v. 2600 Enters.,</i>
177 F.Supp.2d 661, 664 (E.D.Mich.2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>PETA</i> court's reading of the Lanham Act
would encompass almost all uses of a registered trademark, even when the mark
is merely being used to identify the object of consumer criticism.<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[8]</span></span></span></a> This broad view of the Lanham
Act is supported by neither the text of the statute nor the history of
trademark laws in this country. �[T]rademark laws are intended to protect�
consumers from purchasing the products of an infringer �under the mistaken
assumption that they are buying a product produced or sponsored by [the
trademark holder].� <i>Beneficial Corp. v. Beneficial Capital Corp.,</i> 529
F.Supp. 445, 450 (S.D.N.Y.1982). Limiting the Lanham Act to cases where a
defendant is trying to profit from a plaintiff's trademark is consistent with
the Supreme Court's view that �[a trademark's] function is simply to designate
the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good will
against the sale of another's product as his.� <i>United Drug Co. v. Theodore
Rectanus Co.,</i> 248 U.S. 90, 97, 39 S.Ct. 48, 63 L.Ed. 141 (1918); <i>see
also</i> 1 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition � 2:7 (4th ed.2004).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Second Circuit held in <i>United We Stand
America, Inc. v. United We Stand, America New York, Inc.,</i> 128 F.3d 86, 90
(2d Cir.1997), that the �use in connection with the sale of goods and services�
requirement of the Lanham Act does not require any actual <i>sale</i> of goods
and services. Thus, the appropriate inquiry is whether Kremer offers <i>competing</i>
services to the public. Kremer is not Bosley's competitor; he is their critic.
His use of the Bosley mark is not in connection with a sale of goods or
services&#8212;it is in connection with the expression of his opinion <i>about</i>
Bosley's goods and services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The dangers that the Lanham Act was designed to
address are simply not at issue in this case. The Lanham Act, expressly enacted
to be applied in commercial contexts, does not prohibit all unauthorized uses
of a trademark. Kremer's use of the Bosley Medical mark simply cannot mislead
consumers into buying a competing product&#8212;no customer will mistakenly
purchase a hair replacement service from Kremer under the belief that the
service is being offered by Bosley. Neither is Kremer capitalizing on the good
will Bosley has created in its mark. Any harm to Bosley arises not from a
competitor's sale of a similar product under Bosley's mark, but from Kremer's
criticism of their services. Bosley cannot use the Lanham Act either as a
shield from Kremer's criticism, or as a sword to shut Kremer up.<a href="#_ftn9"

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Difference in
the Language of Lanham Act � 32 and � 43(a)</i>.&nbsp; You will have noticed
that the two likelihood of confusion sections formulate the commercial use
requirement slightly differently.&nbsp; <i>Compare</i> Lanham Act � 32(1)(a),
15 U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a) (establishing liability for �[a]ny person who shall use
in commerce� the plaintiff�s mark �in connection with the sale, offering for
sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services<i>� </i>in a manner
that is confusing) <i>to</i> Lanham Act � 43(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)
(establishing liability for �[a]ny person who, on or in connection with any
goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce� the
plaintiff�s mark in a manner that is confusing).&nbsp; In practice, courts have
read both statements of the commercial use requirement to mean the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Commercial Use
Requirement and Trademark Dilution</i>.&nbsp; We will address the issue of
trademark dilution below in Part II.C.&nbsp; Note for the moment that the
antidilution section of the Lanham Act, � 43(c), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c), does not
include language akin to what we find in Lanham Act �� 32 and 43(a).&nbsp;
Under a previous, now-abrogated version of � 43(c) (which trademark lawyers
traditionally refer to as the old �Federal Trademark Dilution Act� or �FTDA�),
courts read the phrase �another person's commercial use in commerce� to
implement the commercial use requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>See</i> Bosley Medical
Institute, Inc. v. Kremer, 403 F.3d 672, 676 (9th Cir. 2005) (�[W]e have
interpreted the language [of � 43(c)(1)] to be roughly analogous to the �in
connection with� sale of goods and services requirement of the infringement
statute.�).&nbsp; The new � 43(c), effective as of October 6, 2006, which
trademark lawyers often refer to as the �Trademark Dilution Revision Act� or
�TDRA�, instead requires that the defendant makes �use of a mark or trade name
in commerce.�&nbsp; 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1). Courts have read this language to
require a showing of defendant�s commercial use akin to what is required under
� 32 and �&nbsp;43(a).&nbsp; More precisely, courts have read the new � 43(c)
�use of <i>mark</i>� language to require the plaintiff to prove that the
defendant is using its accused designation as a trademark, as a designation of
source, for its own good or services.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g., National Business
Forms &amp; Printing, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co</i>., 671 F.3d 526, 536 (5th Cir.
2012) (�We agree with the district court that NBFP did not �use� Ford's marks
(as the TDRA contemplates that term) in identifying or distinguishing its own
goods or services merely by reproducing them for customers as part of its commercial
printing business.�).&nbsp; <i>See also</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>

Infringement</a></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The overriding question in most federal trademark
infringement litigation is a simple one: is the defendant�s trademark, because
of its similarity to the plaintiff�s trademark, causing or likely to cause
consumer confusion as to the source or sponsorship of the defendant�s
goods?&nbsp; Each of the circuits requires that, in answering this question,
the district court conduct a multifactor analysis of the likelihood of consumer
confusion according to the factors set out by that circuit.&nbsp; As the
Seventh Circuit has explained, the multifactor test operates �as a heuristic
device to assist in determining whether confusion exists.�&nbsp; <i>Sullivan v.
CBS Corp</i>., 385 F.3d 772, 778 (7th Cir. 2004).&nbsp; In Part II.B.1, we will
briefly review the peculiar history of the multifactor test approach to the
likelihood of confusion (or �LOC�) question.&nbsp; In Part II.C.2, we will
focus on one recent and particularly rich application of the multifactor test
in <i>Virgin Enterprises Ltd. v. Nawab</i>, 335 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. 2003).&nbsp; Part
II.C.3 will address the use of survey evidence in the LOC context.&nbsp; Parts
III.C.4 through III.C.7 will address various modes of consumer confusion such
as �sponsorship or affiliation� confusion, �initial interest� confusion,
�post-sale� confusion, and �reverse� confusion.&nbsp; Part II.C.8 will return
briefly to the Lanham Act � 2(d) bar to registration of a mark that is
confusingly-similar to a previously registered mark.</p>

appliances used in connection with all or any of the purposes aforesaid, or
with selling and transporting the manufactured or other products of the
company; and to do any and all things connected with or incidental to the
carrying on of such business, or any branch or part thereof.� </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It may be stated in this connection that the
charter of the company contains no express authority to manufacture or sell
what is known commercially as ice cream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The record shows that the appellee uses in the
disposition of its products some thirty-two brands, each one of which either
contains the name �Borden,� or is used in connection with the name �Borden's
Condensed Milk Company.� Of these brands sixteen specifically refer to
condensed or evaporated milk, seven to candy, two to malted milk, one to
coffee, one to butter, one to buttermilk, one to fluid milk, two to cream, and
one to malted milk ice cream; and that trade-marks have been registered on most
of the brands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellee has developed in the state of Illinois and
the city of Chicago, and elsewhere, a large business in the sale of fresh milk
and cream and evaporated milk to confectioners for use by them in making
commercial ice cream. It has expended large sums of money in promoting and
advertising its business, and particularly in extending the sale of the
so-called �Borden's Peerless Brand Evaporated Milk, Confectioners' Size,� a
high quality of evaporated milk inclosed [sic] in cans, especially designed for
use in the manufacture of ice cream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For more than two years prior to the filing of the
bill in the District Court, the appellee had been manufacturing a form of ice
cream known as �Borden's Malted Milk Ice Cream,� which product is, as the name
implies, an ice cream made with malted milk as its basic element, and is
especially adapted for use in hospitals. This malted milk ice cream, which
hitherto has been used only in hospitals, the appellee is about to place on the
market for general use in competition with commercial ice cream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On May 25, 1911, the appellants Charles F. Borden,
George W. Brown, and Edgar V. Stanley applied to the Secretary of State of the
state of Illinois for a license to incorporate under the name of �Borden Ice
Cream Company.� On July 31, 1911, the appellee notified the individual
appellants that the term �Borden� had become so firmly established in
connection with the products of the appellee the use of that word in connection
with any company dealing in milk products would lead to the presumption that
they were the products of the appellee, and demanded that the word �Borden� be
eliminated from appellants' company name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the same day appellee protested to the Secretary
of State of the state of Illinois against the issuance of any charter under the
name of �Borden Ice Cream Company,� but on the 16th of August, 1911, a charter
was duly issued to the �Borden Ice Cream Company,� by which it was authorized
�to manufacture and sell ice cream, ices and similar products.� </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The appellant Charles F. Borden had never before
been engaged in the ice cream business, or in buying or selling milk or milk
products, or in any similar business, and is not the principal person connected
with the appellant Borden Ice Cream Company. The appellant Lawler is an ice
cream manufacturer, and has subscribed to 47 out of a total of 50 shares of
stock of the Borden Ice Cream Company. Charles F. Borden has subscribed to one
share of stock, and has not paid for that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The bill charges, upon information and belief, that
it is the intention of appellant Borden Ice Cream Company to use the word
�Borden� for the purpose of trading upon the reputation of appellee's goods and
products, and for the purpose of deceiving and defrauding the public into the
belief that such product is the product of the appellee; that such �improper,
deceitful and fraudulent use of the name 'Borden� will be a great and
irreparable injury to the complainant's (appellee's) property right in its
trade-name; and that the reputation of the products of complainant (appellee)
will be greatly injured thereby; and that the business of complainant
(appellee) will be injured;� and that there will be great confusion in the
business carried on by the original company because of such improper use; and
that it will be impossible for present and prospective customers to know that
the product of the Borden Ice Cream Company is not the product of Borden's
Condensed Milk Company. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The bill and the affidavits on file do not show any
facts tending to sustain the allegation of irreparable injury to the old
company or its business, or showing or tending to show that the old company has
been or will be injured in any way in the business which it is now engaged in.
Moreover, it does not appear that the malted milk ice cream manufactured by the
old company will in any way come into competition with the commercial ice cream
proposed to be put on the market by the new company. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The bill was filed before the defendant had started
to do any business. The answer admits most of the material allegations, but
denies all fraudulent purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>CARPENTER, District Judge (after stating the facts as
above).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;A personal name, such as �Borden,� is not
susceptible of exclusive appropriation, and even its registration in the Patent
Office cannot make it a valid trade-mark. <i>Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff</i>, 198
U.S. 134,; El<i>gin Natl. Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co</i>., 179 U.S.
665; <i>Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co</i>., 163 U.S. 169; <i>Brown Chemical
Co. v. Meyer</i>, 139 U.S. 540.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no charge made in the bill that the
appellants are infringing, or propose to infringe, upon any technical
trade-mark of the appellee, so we may dismiss any claim for relief upon that
score.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;The only theory upon which the injunction in
this case can be sustained is upon that known as unfair competition. Relief
against unfair competition is granted solely upon the ground that one who has
built up a good will and reputation for his goods or business is entitled to
all of the resultant benefits. Good will or business popularity is property,
and, like other property, will be protected against fraudulent invasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The question to be determined in every case of
unfair competition is whether or not, as a matter of fact, the name used by the
defendant had come previously to indicate and designate the complainant's
goods. Or, to put it in another way, whether the defendant, as a matter of
fact, is, by his conduct, passing off his goods as the complainant's goods, or
his business as the complainant's business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It has been said that the universal test question
in cases of this class is whether the public is likely to be deceived as to the
maker or seller of the goods. This, in our opinion, is not the fundamental
question. The deception of the public naturally tends to injure the proprietor
of a business by diverting his customers and depriving him of sales which
otherwise he might have made. This, rather than the protection of the public
against imposition, is the sound and true basis for the private remedy. That
the public is deceived may be evidence of the fact that the original
proprietor's rights are being invaded. If, however, the rights of the original
proprietor are in no wise interfered with, the deception of the public is no
concern of a court of chancery. American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co., 103
Fed. 281.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Doubtless it is morally wrong for a person to
proclaim, or even intimate, that his goods are manufactured by some other and
well-known concern; but this does not give rise to a private right of action,
unless the property rights of that concern are interfered with. The use by the
new company of the name �Borden� may have been with fraudulent intent; and,
even assuming that it was, the trial court had no right to interfere, unless
the property rights of the old company were jeopardized. Nothing else being
shown, a court of equity cannot punish an unorthodox or immoral, or even
dishonest, trader; it cannot enforce as such the police power of the state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the case now under our consideration the old
company (the appellee) never has manufactured what is known as commercial ice
cream. The new company (the appellant) was incorporated for the sole purpose of
manufacturing and putting on the market such an article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nonexclusive trade-names are public property in
their primary sense, but they may in their secondary sense come to be
understood as indicating the goods or business of a particular trader. Such
trade-names are acquired by adoption and user, and belong to the one who first
used them and gave them value in a specific line of business. It is true that
the name of a person may become so associated with his goods or business that
another person of the same or a similar name engaging in the same business will
not be allowed to use even his own name, without affirmatively distinguishing
his goods or business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The secondary meaning of a name, however, has no
legal significance, unless the two persons make or deal in the same kind of
goods. Clearly the appellants here could make gloves, or plows, or cutlery,
under the name �Borden� without infringing upon any property right of the old
company. If that is true, they can make anything under the name �Borden� which
the appellee has not already made and offered to the public. George v. Smith
(C.C.) 52 Fed. 830.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The name �Borden,� until appellants came into the
field, never had been associated with commercial ice cream. By making
commercial ice cream the appellants do not come into competition with the
appellee. In the absence of competition, the old company cannot assert the
rights accruing from what has been designated as the secondary meaning of the
word �Borden.� The phrase �unfair competition� presupposes competition of some
sort. In the absence of competition the doctrine cannot be invoked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There being no competition between the appellants
and appellee, we are confronted with the proposition that the appellee, in
order to succeed on this appeal, has and can enforce a proprietary right to the
name �Borden� in any kind of business, to the exclusion of all the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is urged that appellee has power, under its
charter, to make commercial ice cream, and that it intends some day to do so.
If such intention can be protected at this time, it might well be that
appellee, having enjoined appellants from making commercial ice cream, would
rest content with selling its evaporated milk to ice cream dealers, and never
itself manufacture the finished product. But, as was well stated by Judge Coxe,
in George v. Smith, supra:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�It is the party who uses it first as a brand for his
goods, and builds up a business under it, who is entitled to protection, and
not the one who first thought of using it on similar goods, but did not use it.
The law deals with acts and not intentions.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellee also urges that it makes and sells large
quantities of evaporated or condensed milk to manufacturers of ice cream, and
that if the appellants are permitted to use the name �Borden� in the ice cream
business dealers probably will believe that its ice cream is made by appellee,
and will in consequence buy the finished product rather than the component
parts, and that appellee's sales of evaporated or condensed milk will fall off,
to its manifest damage. Such result would be too speculative and remote to form
the basis of an order restraining men from using in their business any personal
name, especially their own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Appellee is in this position: If it bases its right
to an injunction upon the doctrine of unfair competition, no competition of any
kind has been shown by the record. If it relies upon some supposed damage which
may result from appellants' use of the name �Borden� in connection with
inferior goods, the action is premature, because the appellants, as yet, have
neither sold nor made anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The order of the District Court must be reversed;
and it is so ordered.</p>

for trademark infringement.&nbsp; Instead, it proposed four factors that courts
should consider in all cases and nine more factors that courts should
additionally consider only when the parties goods were noncompetitive with each
other, i.e., not substitutable for each other.&nbsp; Section 729 of the <i>Restatement
(First)</i> set out the four factors courts should always consider:</span></p>

<p class=Blockquote>In determining whether the actor's designation is
confusingly similar to the other's trade-mark or trade name, the following
factors are important:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(a) the degree of similarity between the designation and

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:.3in'>(i) appearance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through the course of the mid-twentieth century, the federal
courts lost track of the distinction between the two sets of factors, and the
circuits each began to use a single, unified multifactor test regardless of
whether the parties� goods were competitive or not.&nbsp; <span
style='line-height:120%'>Each circuit developed its own test, and for the most
part, the peculiarities of the particular cases in which the circuit�s
multifactor test first coalesced determined which factors are still considered
in that circuit today.&nbsp; A good example of this is found in the following
opinion, <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp</i>., 287 F.2d 402 (2d
Cir. 1961), which is the origin of the Second Circuit�s �<i>Polaroid</i>

meant for situations �[w]here the products are different,� <i>id</i>. at 495,
Second Circuit courts routinely apply the <i>Polaroid</i> factors in competing
goods cases.&nbsp; The opinion is presented here primarily for its historical
significance as one of the most influential opinions in U.S. trademark law, but
also to show, in the final paragraph of the opinion excerpt, how much trademark

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff, Polaroid Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, owner of the trademark Polaroid and holder of 22 United States
registrations thereof granted between 1936 and 1956 and of a New York
registration granted in 1950, brought this action in the Eastern District of
New York, alleging that defendant's use of the name Polarad as a trademark and
as part of defendant's corporate title infringed plaintiff's Federal and state
trademarks and constituted unfair competition. It sought a broad injunction and
an accounting. Defendant's answer, in addition to denying the allegations of
the complaint, sought a declaratory judgment establishing defendant's right to
use Polarad in the business in which defendant was engaged, an injunction against
plaintiff's use of Polaroid in the television and electronics fields, and other
relief. Judge Rayfiel, in an opinion reported in D.C.1960, 182 F.Supp. 350,
dismissed both the claim and the counterclaims, concluding that neither
plaintiff nor defendant had made an adequate showing with respect to confusion
and that both had been guilty of laches. Both parties appealed but defendant
has withdrawn its cross-appeal. We find it unnecessary to pass upon Judge
Rayfiel's conclusion that defendant's use of Polarad does not violate any of
plaintiff's rights. For we agree that plaintiff's delay in proceeding against
defendant bars plaintiff from relief so long as defendant's use of Polarad
remains as far removed from plaintiff's primary fields of activity as it has
been and still is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The name Polaroid was first adopted by plaintiff's
predecessor in 1935. It has been held to be a valid trademark as a coined or
invented symbol and not to have lost its right to protection by becoming
generic or descriptive, <i>Marks v. Polaroid Corp</i>., D.C.D.Mass.1955, 129
F.Supp. 243. Polaroid had become a well known name as applied to sheet
polarizing material and products made therefrom, as well as to optical desk
lamps, stereoscopic viewers, etc., long before defendant was organized in 1944.
During World War II, plaintiff's business greatly expanded, from $1,032,000 of
gross sales in 1941 to $16,752,000 in 1945, due in large part to government
contracts. Included in this government business were three sorts on which
plaintiff particularly relies, the sale of Schmidt corrector plates, an optical
lens used in television; research and development contracts for guided missiles
and a machine gun trainer, both involving the application of electronics; and
other research and development contracts for what plaintiff characterizes as
�electro-optical devices employing electronic circuitry in combination with
optical apparatus.� In 1947 and 1948 plaintiff's sales declined to little more
than their pre-war level; the tremendous expansion of plaintiff's business,
reaching sales of $65,271,000 in 1958, came after the development of the Land
camera in 1948.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendant was organized in December, 1944.
Originally a partnership called Polarad Electronics Co., it was converted in
1948 into a New York corporation bearing the name Polarad Television Corp.,
which was changed a year later to Polarad Electronics Corp. Its principal
business has been the sale of microwave generating, receiving and measuring
devices and of television studio equipment. Defendant claimed it had arrived at
the name Polarad by taking the first letters of the first and last names of its
founder, Paul Odessey, and the first two letters of the first name of his
friend and anticipated partner, Larry Jaffe, and adding the suffix �rad,�
intended to signify radio; however, Odessey admitted that at the time he had
�some knowledge� of plaintiff's use of the name Polaroid, although only as
applied to glasses and polarizing filters and not as to electronics. As early
as November, 1945, plaintiff learned of defendant; it drew a credit report and
had one of its attorneys visit defendant's quarters, then two small rooms;
plaintiff made no protest. By June, 1946, defendant was advertising television
equipment in �Electronics'&#8212;a trade journal. These advertisements and
other notices with respect to defendant came to the attention of plaintiff's
officers; still plaintiff did nothing. In 1950, a New York Attorney who
represented plaintiff in foreign patent matters came upon a trade show display
of defendant's television products under the name Polarad and informed
plaintiff's house counsel; the latter advised plaintiff's president, Dr. Land, that
�the time had come when he thought we ought to think seriously about the
problem.� However, nothing was done save to draw a further credit report on
defendant, although defendant's sales had grown from a nominal amount to a rate
of several hundred thousand dollars a year, and the report related, as had the
previous one, that defendant was engaged �in developing and manufacturing
equipment for radio, television and electronic manufacturers throughout the
United States.� In October, 1951, defendant, under its letterhead, forwarded to
plaintiff a letter addressed to �Polarad Electronics Corp.� at defendant's
Brooklyn address, inquiring in regard to �polaroid material designed for night
driving�; there was no protest by plaintiff. In 1953, defendant applied to the
United States Patent Office for registration of its trademark Polarad for radio
and television units and other electronic devices; in August, 1955, when this
application was published in the Official Gazette of the Patent Office,
plaintiff for the first time took action by filing a notice of opposition,
which was overruled by the Examiner in April, 1957. Still plaintiff delayed
bringing suit until late 1956. Through all this period defendant was expending
considerable sums for advertising and its business was growing&#8212;employees
increasing from eight in the calendar year 1945 to 530 in the year ended June
30, 1956, fixed assets from $2,300 to $371,800, inventories from $3,000 to
$1,547,400, and sales from $12,000 to $6,048,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Conceding that the bulk of its business is in
optics and photography, lines not pursued by defendant, plaintiff nevertheless
claims to be entitled to protection of its distinctive mark in at least certain
portions of the large field of electronics. Plaintiff relies on its sales of
Schmidt corrector plates, used in certain types of television systems, first
under government contracts beginning in 1943 and to industry commencing in
1945; on its sale, since 1946, of polarizing television filters, which serve
the same function as the color filters that defendant supplies as a part of the
television apparatus sold by it; and, particularly, on the research and
development contracts with the government referred to above. Plaintiff relies
also on certain instances of confusion, predominantly communications intended
for defendant but directed to plaintiff. Against this, defendant asserts that
its business is the sale of complex electronics equipment to a relatively few
customers; that this does not compete in any significant way with plaintiff's
business, the bulk of which is now in articles destined for the ultimate
consumer; that plaintiff's excursions into electronics are insignificant in the
light of the size of the field; that the instances of confusion are minimal;
that there is no evidence that plaintiff has suffered either through loss of customers
or injury to reputation, since defendant has conducted its business with high
standards; and that the very nature of defendant's business, sales to experienced
industrial users and the government, precludes any substantial possibility of
confusion. Defendant also asserts plaintiff's laches to be a bar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The problem of determining how far a valid
trademark shall be protected with respect to goods other than those to which
its owner has applied it, has long been vexing and does not become easier of
solution with the years. Neither of our recent decisions so heavily relied upon
by the parties, <i>Harold F. Ritchie, Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond's, Inc</i>., 2
Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 755, by plaintiff, and <i>Avon Shoe Co., Inc. v. David
Crystal, Inc</i>., 2 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 607 by defendant, affords much
assistance, since in the Ritchie case there was confusion as to the identical
product and the defendant in the Avon case had adopted its mark �without
knowledge of the plaintiffs' prior use,� at page 611. Where the products are
different, the prior owner's chance of success is a function of many variables:
the strength of his mark, the degree of similarity between the two marks, the
proximity of the products, the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the
gap, actual confusion, and the reciprocal of defendant's good faith in adopting
its own mark, the quality of defendant's product, and the sophistication of the
buyers. Even this extensive catalogue does not exhaust the possibilities&#8212;the
court may have to take still other variables into account. American Law
Institute, Restatement of Torts, �� 729, 730, 731. Here plaintiff's mark is a
strong one and the similarity between the two names is great, but the evidence
of actual confusion, when analyzed, is not impressive. The filter seems to be
the only case where defendant has sold, but not manufactured, a product serving
a function similar to any of plaintiff's, and plaintiff's sales of this item
have been highly irregular, varying, e.g., from $2,300 in 1953 to $303,000 in
1955, and $48,000 in 1956.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If defendant's sole business were the manufacture
and sale of microwave equipment, we should have little difficulty in approving
the District Court's conclusion that there was no such likelihood of confusion
as to bring into play either the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. � 1114(1), or New York
General Business Law, � 368-b, or to make out a case of unfair competition
under New York decisional law, see <i>Avon Shoe Co. v. David Crystal, Inc</i>.,
supra, at page 614, footnote 11. What gives us some pause is defendant's heavy
involvement in a phase of electronics that lies closer to plaintiff's business,
namely, television. Defendant makes much of the testimony of plaintiff's
executive vice president that plaintiff's normal business is �the interaction
of light and matter.� Yet, although television lies predominantly in the area
of electronics, it begins and ends with light waves. The record tells us that
certain television uses were among the factors that first stimulated Dr. Land's
interest in polarization, see <i>Marks v. Polaroid Corporation</i>, supra, 129
F.Supp. at page 246, plaintiff has manufactured and sold at least two products
for use in television systems, and defendant's second counterclaim itself
asserts likelihood of confusion in the television field. We are thus by no
means sure that, under the views with respect to trademark protection announced
by this Court in such cases as <i>Yale Electric Corp. v. Robertson</i>, 2 Cir.,
1928, 26 F.2d 972 (locks vs. flashlights); <i>L. E. Waterman Co. v. Gordon</i>,
2 Cir., 1934, 72 F.2d 272 (mechanical pens and pencils vs. razor blades); <i>Triangle
Publications, Inc. v. Rohrlich</i>, 2 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 969, 972 (magazines
vs. girdles); and <i>Admiral Corp. v. Penco, Inc</i>., 2 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d
517 (radios, electric ranges and refrigerators vs. sewing machines and vacuum
cleaners), plaintiff would not have been entitled to at least some injunctive
relief if it had moved with reasonable promptness. However, we are not required
to decide this since we uphold the District Court's conclusion with respect to
laches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>�His Mark is His
Authentic Seal.�</i>&nbsp; In <i>Yale Elec. Corp. v. Robertson</i>, 26 F.2d 972
(2d Cir. 1928), which Judge Friendly cites in the final paragraph of <i>Polaroid</i>,
Judge Hand set forth his oft-quoted description of the plaintiff�s interest in
preventing the use of its mark on noncompeting goods:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>However, it has of recent years been recognized that a
merchant may have a sufficient economic interest in the use of his mark outside
the field of his own exploitation to justify interposition by a court. His mark
is his authentic seal; by it he vouches for the goods which bear it; it carries
his name for good or ill. If another uses it, he borrows the owner's
reputation, whose quality no longer lies within his own control. This is an
injury, even though the borrower does not tarnish it, or divert any sales by
its use; for a reputation, like a face, is the symbol of its possessor and
creator, and another can use it only as a mask. And so it has come to be
recognized that, unless the borrower's use is so foreign to the owner's as to
insure against any identification of the two, it is unlawful.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 974.&nbsp; If the defendant�s conduct
�does not tarnish [the plaintiff�s reputation], or divert any sales by its
use,� then what exactly is the harm to the plaintiff?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each circuit has developed its own formulation of the
multifactor test for the likelihood of consumer confusion.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
as the chart entitled �Factors Considered by Circuit� suggests, the circuits�
various tests are roughly similar.&nbsp; Notably absent from the Fourth, Fifth,

sophistication of the relevant consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Virgin Enterprises Ltd. v. Nawab</i>, 335 F.3d 141 (2d
Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit applied its <i>Polaroid</i> test to determine if
consumers would likely mistake the goods and services of the defendant,
operating under the mark <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>virgin wireless</span>,
for the those of the plaintiff, the owner of the <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>virgin</span> mark for a wide variety of goods and services.&nbsp;
The opinion is exceptional for its thorough analysis of the factors.&nbsp; In

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff Virgin Enterprises Limited (�VEL� or
�plaintiff�) appeals from the denial of its motion for a preliminary
injunction. This suit, brought under � 32 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1114(1), alleges that defendants infringed plaintiff's rights in the registered
mark VIRGIN by operating retail stores selling wireless telephones and related
accessories and services under the trade name VIRGIN WIRELESS. The United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Sifton, <i>J.</i>) denied
plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, based upon its finding that
plaintiff's registration did not cover the retail sale of wireless telephones
and related products, and that plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of
consumer confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff VEL, a corporation with its principal
place of business in London, owns U.S. Registration No. 1,851,817 (�the 817 Registration�),
filed on May 5, 1991, and registered on August 30, 1994, for the VIRGIN mark as
applied to �<i>retail store services</i> in the fields of ... computers and <i>electronic
apparatus</i> � (emphasis added)... Plaintiff also owns U.S. Registration No.
1,852,776 (�the 776 Registration�), filed on May 9, 1991, and registered on
September 6, 1994, for a stylized version of the VIRGIN mark for use in
connection with �retail store services in the fields of ... computers and
electronic apparatus,� and U.S. Registration No. 1,863,353 (�the 353 Registration�),
filed on May 19, 1992, and registered on November 15, 1994, for the VIRGIN
MEGASTORE mark. It is undisputed that these three registrations have become
incontestable pursuant to 15 U.S.C. � 1065.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> VEL, either directly or through corporate
affiliates, operates various businesses worldwide under the trade name VIRGIN,
including an airline, large-scale record stores called Virgin Megastores, and
an internet information service. Plaintiff or its affiliates also market a
variety of goods branded with the VIRGIN name, including music recordings,
computer games, books, and luggage. Three of plaintiff's megastores are located
in the New York area. According to an affidavit submitted to the district court
in support of plaintiff's application for preliminary injunction, Virgin
Megastores sell a variety of electronic apparatus, including video game
systems, portable CD players, disposable cameras, and DVD players. These stores
advertise in a variety of media, including radio.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Defendants Simon Blitz and Daniel Gazal are the
sole shareholders of defendants Cel-Net Communications, Inc. (�Cel-Net�); The
Cellular Network Communications, Inc., doing business as CNCG (�CNCG�); and SD
Telecommunications, Inc. (�SD Telecom�). Blitz and Gazal formed Cel-Net in 1993
to sell retail wireless telephones and services in the New York area. Later,
they formed CNCG to sell wireless phones and services on the wholesale level.
CNCG now sells wireless phones and services to more than 400 independent
wireless retailers. In 1998, Cel-Net received permission from New York State
regulators to resell telephone services within the state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Around 1999, Andrew Kastein, a vice-president of
CNCG, began to develop a Cel-Net brand of wireless telecommunications products.
In early 1999, Cel-Net entered into negotiations with the Sprint PCS network to
provide telecommunications services for resale by Cel-Net. In August 1999,
Cel-Net retained the law firm Pennie &amp; Edmonds to determine the
availability of possible service marks for Cel-Net. Pennie &amp; Edmonds
associate Elizabeth Langston researched for Kastein a list of possible service
marks; among the marks Cel-Net asked to have researched was VIRGIN. Defendants
claim that Langston told Cel-Net officer Simon Corney that VIRGIN was available
for use in the telecommunications field. Plaintiff disputed this, offering an
affidavit from Langston that she informed defendants that she would not search
the VIRGIN mark because her firm represented plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> According to defendants, in December 1999, Cel-Net
retained Corporate Solutions, LLC and its principals Nathan Erlich and Tahir
Nawab as joint venture partners to help raise capital to launch Cel-Net's
wireless telephone service. On December 2, 1999, Erlich and Nawab filed four
intent-to-use applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (�PTO�) to
register the marks VIRGIN WIRELESS, VIRGIN MOBILE, VIRGIN COMMUNICATIONS, and
VIRGIN NET in the field of telecommunications services, class 38. On December
24, 1999, Corporate Solutions incorporated defendant Virgin Wireless, Inc.
(�VWI�) and licensed to VWI the right to use the marks VIRGIN WIRELESS and
VIRGIN MOBILE. Meanwhile, one of plaintiff's affiliates had begun to offer
wireless telecommunication services bearing the VIRGIN mark in the United
Kingdom. A press release dated November 19, 1999, found on plaintiff's website,
stated that its Virgin Mobile wireless services were operable in the United
States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On June 23, 2000, defendant Blitz signed a lease
under the name Virgin Wireless for a kiosk location in South Shore Mall in Long
Island from which to re-sell AT &amp; T wireless services, telephones, and
accessories under the retail name Virgin Wireless. Defendants Cel-Net and VWI
later expanded their telecommunications re-sale operations to include two
retail stores and four additional retail kiosks in malls in the New York area
and in Pennsylvania. All of these stores have been run by VWI under the trade
name VIRGIN WIRELESS. VWI also has leases and bank accounts in its name, and
has shown evidence of actual retail transactions and newspaper advertisements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In August 2000, plaintiff licensed Virgin Mobile
USA, LLC, to use the VIRGIN mark for wireless telecommunications services in the
United States. On August 10, 2000, plaintiff filed an intent-to-use application
with the PTO for use of the VIRGIN mark in the United States on
telecommunications services and mobile telephones. On October 11, 2001, the PTO
suspended this mark's registration in international class 9, which covers
wireless telephones, and class 38, which covers telecommunications services,
because the VIRGIN mark was already reserved by a prior filing, presumably
defendants'. On August 16, 2001, plaintiff filed another intent-to-use
application for the mark VIRGIN MOBILE to brand telecommunications services.
The PTO issued a non-final action letter for both of plaintiff's pending new
registrations on October 31, 2001, which stated that defendant Corporation
Solutions' pending applications for similar marks in the same class could give
rise to �a likelihood of confusion.� The PTO suspended action on plaintiff's
application pending the processing of Corporation Solutions' applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In October 2001, plaintiff issued a press release
announcing that it was offering wireless telecommunications services and mobile
telephones in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff became aware of Corporation Solutions'
application for registration of the VIRGIN WIRELESS and VIRGIN MOBILE marks by
May 2000. In October 2001 and December 2001, defendant VWI filed suits against
plaintiff in the federal district courts in Arizona and Delaware, alleging that
plaintiff was using VWI's mark. Plaintiff maintains (and the district court
found) that it learned in January 2002 that VWI and Cel-Net were operating
kiosks under the VIRGIN WIRELESS name and two days later filed the present suit
seeking to enjoin defendants from selling mobile phones in VIRGIN-branded
retail stores.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On May 2, 2002, the district court considered
plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction. It found that no
essential facts were in dispute, and therefore no evidentiary hearing was
required. It was uncontested (and the district court accordingly found) that
plaintiff sold �electronic apparatus� in its stores, including �various video
game systems, portable cassette tape, compact disc, mp3, and mini disc players,
portable radios, and disposable cameras,� but not including telephones or telephone
service, and that the only products the defendants sold in their stores were
wireless telephones, telephone accessories, and wireless telephone services�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Arguing against plaintiff's likelihood of success,
the court noted that plaintiff's registrations did not claim use of the VIRGIN
mark �in telecommunications services or in the associated retail sale of
wireless telephones and accessories.� While plaintiff's 817 and 776
Registrations covered the retail sale of �computers and electronic apparatus,�
they did not extend to telecommunications services and wireless phones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The court noted that the defendants were the first
to use the VIRGIN mark in telecommunications, and the first to attempt to
register VIRGIN for telecommunications and retail telephone sales....</p>

<p class=Centered>II.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A claim of trademark infringement, whether brought
under 15 U.S.C. � 1114(1) (for infringement of a registered mark) or 15 U.S.C.
� 1125(a) (for infringement of rights in a mark acquired by use), is analyzed
under the familiar two-prong test described in <i>Gruner + Jahr USA Publ'g v.
Meredith Corp</i><span>.,</span> 991 F.2d 1072 (2d Cir.1993). <i>See Time, Inc.
v. Petersen Publ'g Co. L.L.C</i><span>.,</span> 173 F.3d 113, 117 (2d Cir.1999)
(noting that <i>Gruner</i> test is applicable to claims brought under � 1114(1)
and � 1125(a)). The test looks first to whether the plaintiff's mark is
entitled to protection, and second to whether defendant's use of the mark is
likely to cause consumers confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of the
defendant's goods. <i>Gruner,</i> 991 F.2d at 1074. Examining the question as
the test dictates, we have no doubt that plaintiff was entitled to a
preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We believe the district court accorded plaintiff
too narrow a scope of protection for its famous, arbitrary, and distinctive
mark. There could be no dispute that plaintiff prevailed as to the first prong
of the test&#8212;prior use and ownership. For years, plaintiff had used the
VIRGIN mark on huge, famous stores selling, in addition to music recordings, a
variety of consumer electronic equipment. At the time the defendants began
using VIRGIN, plaintiff owned rights in the mark. The focus of inquiry thus
turns to the second prong of the test&#8212;whether defendants' use of VIRGIN
as a mark for stores selling wireless telephone services and phones was likely
to cause confusion. There can be little doubt that such confusion was likely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The landmark case of <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad
Electronics Corp</i><span>.,</span> 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.1961) (Friendly, <span>J.</span>),
outlined a series of nonexclusive factors likely to be pertinent in addressing
the issue of likelihood of confusion, which are routinely followed in such
cases... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Six of the <i>Polaroid</i> factors relate directly
to the likelihood of consumer confusion. These are the strength of the
plaintiff's mark; the similarity of defendants' mark to plaintiff's; the
proximity of the products sold under defendants' mark to those sold under
plaintiff's; where the products are different, the likelihood that plaintiff
willbridge the gap by selling the products being sold by defendants; the
existence of actual confusion among consumers; and the sophistication of consumers.
Of these six, all but the last (which was found by the district court to be
neutral) strongly favor the plaintiff. The remaining two <i>Polaroid</i>
factors, defendants' good or bad faith and the quality of defendants' products,
are more pertinent to issues other than likelihood of confusion, such as harm
to plaintiff's reputation and choice of remedy. We conclude that the <i>Polaroid</i>
factors powerfully support plaintiff's position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Strength of the mark.</i> The strength of a
trademark encompasses two different concepts, both of which relate
significantly to likelihood of consumer confusion. The first and most important
is inherent strength, also called �inherent distinctiveness.� This inquiry
distinguishes between, on the one hand, inherently distinctive marks&#8212;marks
that are arbitrary or fanciful in relation to the products (or services) on
which they are used&#8212;and, on the other hand, marks that are generic,
descriptive or suggestive as to those goods. The former are the strong marks. <i>Abercrombie
&amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc</i><span>.,</span> 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d
Cir.1976). The second sense of the concept of strength of a mark is �acquired
distinctiveness,� <span>i.e.,</span> fame, or the extent to which prominent use
of the mark in commerce has resulted in a high degree of consumer recognition. <i>See
TCPIP Holding Co. v. Haar Communications Inc</i><span>.,</span> 244 F.3d 88,
100 (2d Cir.2001) (describing these two concepts of strength).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Considering first <i>inherent distinctiveness,</i>
the law accords broad, muscular protection to marks that are arbitrary or
fanciful in relation to the products on which they are used, and lesser
protection, or no protection at all, to marks consisting of words that identify
or describe the goods or their attributes. The reasons for the distinction
arise from two aspects of market efficiency. The paramount objective of the
trademark law is to avoid confusion in the marketplace. The purpose for which
the trademark law accords merchants the exclusive right to the use of a name or
symbol in their area or commerce is <i>identification,</i> so that the
merchants can establish goodwill for their goods based on past satisfactory
performance, and the consuming public can rely on a mark as a guarantee that
the goods or services so marked come from the merchant who has been found to be
satisfactory in the past. <i>See Estee Lauder Inc. v. The Gap, Inc</i><span>.,</span>
108 F.3d 1503, 1510 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition</i> � 21 comment <span>i</span> (1995)); <i>Power Test Petroleum Distribs.,
Inc. v. Calcu Gas, Inc.,</i> 754 F.2d 91, 97 (2d Cir.1985); <i>McGregor-Doniger
Inc. v. Drizzle Inc</i><span>.,</span> 599 F.2d 1126, 1131 (2d Cir.1979). At
the same time, efficiency and the public interest require that every merchant
trading in a class of goods be permitted to refer to the goods by their name,
and to make claims about their quality. Thus, a merchant who sells pencils
under the trademark <i>Pencil</i> or <i>Clear Mark,</i> for example, and seeks
to exclude other sellers of pencils from using those words in their trade, is
seeking an advantage the trademark law does not intend to offer. To grant such
exclusivity would deprive the consuming public of the useful market information
it receives where every seller of pencils is free to call them pencils. <i>Abercrombie</i><span>,</span>
537 F.2d at 9; <i>CES Publ'g Corp. v. St. Regis Publ'ns, Inc.</i><span>,</span>
531 F.2d 11, 13 (2d Cir.1975). The trademark right does not protect the
exclusive right to an advertising message&#8212;only the exclusive right to an
identifier, to protect against confusion in the marketplace. Thus, as a matter
of policy, the trademark law accords broader protection to marks that serve
exclusively as identifiers and lesser protection where a grant of exclusiveness
would tend to diminish the access of others to the full range of discourse
relating to their goods. <i>See TCPIP</i><span>,</span> 244 F.3d at 100; <i>Nabisco,
Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc</i><span>.,</span> 191 F.3d 208, 215 (2d Cir.1999); <i>Otokoyama
Co. Ltd. v. Wine of Japan Import, Inc</i><span>.,</span> 175 F.3d 266, 270 (2d
Cir.1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The second aspect of efficiency that justifies
according broader protection to marks that are inherently distinctive relates
directly to the likelihood of confusion. If a mark is arbitrary or fanciful,
and makes no reference to the nature of the goods it designates, consumers who
see the mark on different objects offered in the marketplace will be likely to
assume, because of the arbitrariness of the choice of mark, that they all come
from the same source. For example, if consumers become familiar with a
toothpaste sold under an unusual, arbitrary brand name, such as <i>ZzaaqQ,</i>
and later see that same inherently distinctive brand name appearing on a
different product, they are likely to assume, notwithstanding the product
difference, that the second product comes from the same producer as the first.
The more unusual, arbitrary, and fanciful a trade name, the more unlikely it is
that two independent entities would have chosen it. In contrast, every seller
of foods has an interest in calling its product �delicious.� Consumers who see
the word <i>delicious</i> used on two or more different food products are less
likely to draw the inference that they must all come from the same producer. <i>Cf.
Streetwise Maps</i><span>,</span> 159 F.3d at 744 (noting that several map
producers use �street� in product names; thus plaintiff's mark using �street�
was not particularly distinctive); <i>W. Publ'g</i><span>,</span> 910 F.2d at
61 (noting numerous registrations of marks using word �golden�). In short, the
more distinctive the mark, the greater the likelihood that the public, seeing
it used a second time, will assume that the second use comes from the same
source as the first. The goal of avoiding consumer confusion thus dictates that
the inherently distinctive, arbitrary, or fanciful marks, i.e., strong marks,
receive broader protection than weak marks, those that are descriptive or
suggestive of the products on which they are used. <i>See Abercrombie</i><span>,</span>
537 F.2d at 9-11; <i>TCPIP</i><span>,</span> 244 F.3d at 100-01.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The second sense of trademark strength, fame, or
�acquired distinctiveness,� also bears on consumer confusion. <i>See TCPIP</i><span>,</span>
244 F.3d at 100-01; <i>Streetwise Maps</i><span>,</span> 159 F.3d at 744. If a
mark has been long, prominently and notoriously used in commerce, there is a
high likelihood that consumers will recognize it from its prior use. Widespread
consumer recognition of a mark previously used in commerce increases the
likelihood that consumers will assume it identifies the previously familiar
user, and therefore increases the likelihood of consumer confusion if the new
user is in fact not related to the first. <i>See Nabisco</i><span>,</span> 191
F.3d at 216-17. A mark's fame also gives unscrupulous traders an incentive to
seek to create consumer confusion by associating themselves in consumers' minds
with a famous mark. The added likelihood of consumer confusion resulting from a
second user's use of a famous mark gives reason for according such a famous
mark a broader scope of protection, at least when it is also inherently
distinctive. <i>See McGregor</i><span>,</span> 599 F.2d at 1132 (noting that
secondary meaning may further enlarge the scope of protection accorded to
inherently distinctive marks).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff's VIRGIN mark undoubtedly scored high on
both concepts of strength. In relation to the sale of consumer electronic
equipment, the VIRGIN mark is inherently distinctive, in that it is arbitrary
and fanciful; the word �virgin� has no intrinsic relationship whatsoever to
selling such equipment. Because there is no intrinsic reason for a merchant to
use the word �virgin� in the sale of consumer electronic equipment, a consumer
seeing VIRGIN used in two different stores selling such equipment will likely
assume that the stores are related.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff's VIRGIN mark was also famous. The mark
had been employed with world-wide recognition as the mark of an airline and as
the mark for megastores selling music recordings and consumer electronic
equipment. The fame of the mark increased the likelihood that consumers seeing
defendants' shops selling telephones under the mark VIRGIN would assume
incorrectly that defendants' shops were a part of plaintiff's organization. <i>See
Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co</i><span>.,</span> 799
F.2d 867, 873 (2d Cir.1986).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There can be no doubt that plaintiff's VIRGIN mark,
as used on consumer electronic equipment, is a strong mark, as the district
court found. It is entitled as such to a broad scope of protection, precisely
because the use of the mark by others in connection with stores selling
reasonably closely related merchandise would inevitably have a high likelihood
of causing consumer confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Similarity of marks.</i> When the secondary
user's mark is not identical but merely similar to the plaintiff's mark, it is
important to assess the degree of similarity between them in assessing the
likelihood that consumers will be confused. <i>See McGregor</i><span>,</span>
599 F.2d at 1133. Plaintiff's and defendants' marks were not merely similar;
they were identical to the extent that both consisted of the same word,
�virgin.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court believed this factor did not favor
plaintiff because it found some differences in appearance. Defendants' logo
used a different typeface and different colors from plaintiff's. While those
are indeed differences, they are quite minor in relation to the fact that the
name being used as a trademark was the same in each case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Advertisement and consumer experience of a mark do
not necessarily transmit all of the mark's features. Plaintiff, for example,
advertised its Virgin Megastores on the radio. A consumer who heard those
advertisements and then saw the defendants' installation using the name VIRGIN
would have no way of knowing that the two trademarks looked different. <i>See
Sports Auth., Inc. v. Prime Hospitality Corp</i><span>.,</span> 89 F.3d 955,
962 (2d Cir.1996). A consumer who had visited one of plaintiff's Virgin
Megastores and remembered the name would not necessarily remember the typeface
and color of plaintiff's mark. The reputation of a mark also spreads by word of
mouth among consumers. One consumer who hears from others about their experience
with Virgin stores and then encounters defendants' Virgin store will have no
way knowing of the differences in typeface. <i>See Hills Bros. Coffee, Inc. v.
Hills Supermarkets, Inc</i><span>.,</span> 428 F.2d 379, 381 (2d Cir.1970) (<span>per
curiam</span> ).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In view of the fact that defendants used the same
name as plaintiff, we conclude the defendants' mark was sufficiently similar to
plaintiff's to increase the likelihood of confusion. This factor favored the
plaintiff as a matter of law. We conclude that the district court erred in
concluding otherwise on the basis of comparatively trivial and often irrelevant
differences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Proximity of the products and likelihood of
bridging the gap.</i> The next factor is the proximity of the products being
sold by plaintiff and defendant under identical (or similar) marks. <i>See
Arrow Fastener,</i> 59 F.3d at 396. This factor has an obvious bearing on the
likelihood of confusion. When the two users of a mark are operating in
completely different areas of commerce, consumers are less likely to assume
that their similarly branded products come from the same source. In contrast,
the closer the secondary user's goods are to those the consumer has seen
marketed under the prior user's brand, the more likely that the consumer will
mistakenly assume a common source. <i>See Cadbury Beverages, Inc. v. Cott Corp</i><span>.,</span>
73 F.3d 474, 480-81 (2d Cir.1996).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While plaintiff had not sold telephones or
telephone service prior to defendant's registration evincing intent to sell
those items, plaintiff had sold quite similar items of consumer electronic
equipment. These included computer video game systems, portable cassette-tape
players, compact disc players, MP3 players, mini-disc players, and disposable
cameras. Like telephones, many of these are small consumer electronic gadgets
making use of computerized audio communication. They are sold in the same
channels of commerce. Consumers would have a high expectation of finding
telephones, portable CD players, and computerized video game systems in the
same stores. We think the proximity in commerce of telephones to CD players
substantially advanced the risk that consumer confusion would occur when both
were sold by different merchants under the same trade name, VIRGIN.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our classic <i>Polaroid</i> test further protects a
trademark owner by examining the likelihood that, even if the plaintiff's
products were not so close to the defendants' when the defendant began to
market them, there was already a likelihood that plaintiff would in the
reasonably near future begin selling those products. <i>See Cadbury Beverages</i><span>,</span>
73 F.3d at 482. VEL's claim of proximity was further strengthened in this
regard because, as the district court expressly found, �plans had been formulated
[for VEL] to enter [the market for telecommunications products and services]
shortly in the future.� VEL had already begun marketing telephone service in England
which would operate in the United States, and, as the district court found, had
made plans to sell telephones and wireless telephone service under the VIRGIN
name from its retail stores.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court, nonetheless, found in favor of
the defendants with respect to the proximity of products and services. We would
ordinarily give considerable deference to a factual finding on this issue. Here,
however, we cannot do so because it appears the district court applied the
wrong test. The court did not assess the <i>proximity</i> of defendants'
VIRGIN-branded retail stores selling telephone products to plaintiff's
VIRGIN-branded retail stores selling other consumer electronic products. It
simply concluded that, because defendants were selling exclusively telephone
products and services, and plaintiff's electronic products did not include
telephones or related services, the defendants must prevail as to the proximity
factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This represents a considerable misunderstanding of
the <i>Polaroid</i> test. The famous list of factors of likely pertinence in
assessing likelihood of confusion in <i>Polaroid</i> was specially designed for
a case like this one, in which the secondary user is not in direct competition
with the prior user, but is selling a somewhat different product or service. In
<i>Polaroid,</i> the plaintiff sold optical and camera equipment, while the
defendant sold electronic apparatus. The test the court discussed was expressly
addressed to the problem �how far a valid trademark shall be protected with respect
to goods <i>other than those to which its owner has applied it.</i>� 287 F.2d
at 495 (emphasis added); <i>see also Arrow Fastener</i><span>,</span> 59 F.3d
at 396 (noting that products need not actually compete with each other). The
very fact that the test includes the �proximity� between the defendant's
products and the plaintiff's and the likelihood that the plaintiff will �bridge
the gap� makes clear that the trademark owner does not lose, as the district
court concluded, merely because it has not previously sold the precise good or
service sold by the secondary user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In our view, had the district court employed the
proper test of proximity, it could not have failed to find a high degree of
proximity as between plaintiff VEL's prior sales of consumer electronic audio
equipment and defendants' subsequent sales of telephones and telephone services,
which proximity would certainly contribute to likelihood of consumer confusion.
And plaintiff was all the more entitled to a finding in its favor in respect of
these matters by virtue of the fact, which the district court <i>did</i> find,
that at the time defendants began using the VIRGIN mark in the retail sale of
telephones and telephone services, plaintiff already had plans to bridge the
gap by expanding its sales of consumer electronic equipment to include sales of
those very goods and services in the near future. Consumer confusion was more
than likely; it was virtually inevitable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Actual confusion.</i> It is self-evident that
the existence of actual consumer confusion indicates a likelihood of consumer
confusion. <i>Nabisco</i><span>,</span> 191 F.3d at 228. We have therefore
deemed evidence of actual confusion �particularly relevant� to the inquiry. <i>Streetwise
Maps</i><span>,</span> 159 F.3d at 745.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff submitted to the district court an
affidavit of a former employee of defendant Cel-Net, who worked at a mall kiosk
branded as Virgin Wireless, which stated that individuals used to ask him if
the kiosk was affiliated with plaintiff's VIRGIN stores. The district court
correctly concluded that this evidence weighed in plaintiff's favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Sophistication of consumers.</i> The degree of
sophistication of consumers can have an important bearing on likelihood of
confusion. Where the purchasers of a products are highly trained professionals,
they know the market and are less likely than untrained consumers to be misled
or confused by the similarity of different marks. The district court recognized
that �[r]etail customers, such as the ones catered to by both the defendants
and [plaintiff], are not expected to exercise the same degree of care as
professional buyers, who are expected to have greater powers of discrimination.�
On the other hand, it observed that purchasers of cellular telephones and the
service plans were likely to give greater care than self-service customers in a
supermarket. Noting that neither side had submitted evidence on the
sophistication of consumers, the court made no finding favoring either side. We
agree that the sophistication factor is neutral in this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Bad faith and the quality of the defendants'
services or products.</i> Two factors remain of the conventional <i>Polaroid</i>
test: the existence of bad faith on the part of the secondary user and the
quality of the secondary user's products or services. <i>Polaroid</i><span>,</span>
287 F.2d at 495. Neither factor is of high relevance to the issue of likelihood
of confusion. A finding that a party acted in bad faith can affect the court's
choice of remedy or can tip the balance where questions are close. It does not
bear directly on whether consumers are likely to be confused. <i>See TCPIP</i><span>,</span>
244 F.3d at 102. The district court noted some evidence of bad faith on the
defendants' part, but because the evidence on the issue was scant and
equivocal, the court concluded that such a finding �at this stage [would be]
speculative.� The court therefore found that this factor favored neither party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The issue of the quality of the secondary user's
product goes more to the harm that confusion can cause the plaintiff's mark and
reputation than to the likelihood of confusion. <i>See Arrow Fastener</i><span>,</span>
59 F.3d at 398 (noting that first user's reputation may be harmed if secondary
user's goods are of poor quality). In any event, the district court found this
factor to be �neutral� with respect to likelihood of confusion.</p>

<p class=Centered>&nbsp;* * * * * *</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In summary we conclude that of the six <i>Polaroid</i>
factors that pertain directly to the likelihood of consumer confusion, all but
one favor the plaintiff, and that one&#8212;sophistication of consumers&#8212;is
neutral. The plaintiff is strongly favored by the strength of its mark, both
inherent and acquired; the similarity of the marks; the proximity of the
products and services; the likelihood that plaintiff would bridge the gap; and
the existence of actual confusion. None of the factors favors the defendant.
The remaining factors were found to be neutral. Although we do not suggest that
likelihood of confusion may be properly determined simply by the number of
factors in one party's favor, the overall assessment in this case in our view
admits only of a finding in plaintiff's favor that defendants' sale of
telephones and telephone-related services under the VIRGIN mark was likely to
cause substantial consumer confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> One issue remains. Defendants argue that plaintiff
should be barred by laches from seeking injunctive relief. They contend that
because of plaintiff's delay after learning of the defendants' applications to
register the VIRGIN marks, they expended considerable sums and developed
goodwill in their use of the VIRGIN marks before plaintiff brought suit. Because
the district court ruled in the defendants' favor it made no express finding on
the issue of laches. But the district court explicitly found that plaintiff
first learned of defendants' use of the name VIRGIN in commerce only two days
before plaintiff instituted this suit. Given that finding, plaintiff could not
be chargeable with laches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We conclude that, as a matter of law, plaintiff
demonstrated irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits and was
entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>

style='line-height:120%'>The </span></i><span style='line-height:120%'>Abercrombie<i>
Spectrum</i>. In its discussion of inherent distinctiveness, the court divides
the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum into inherently and non-inherently distinctive
marks: �<span style='color:black'>This inquiry distinguishes between, on the
one hand, inherently distinctive marks&#8212;marks that are arbitrary or
fanciful in relation to the products (or services) on which they are
used&#8212;and, on the other hand, marks that are generic, descriptive or
suggestive as to those goods.� Do you detect an error in this division?</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='line-height:120%;
color:black'>Later in the opinion, the court refers to the Virgin mark as
�arbitrary and fanciful.� Should we treat these two <i>Abercrombie</i>

marks than to arbitrary marks?</span></p>

intent factor is not �of high relevance� and may only �tip the balance where
the questions are close,� the study also suggests that the outcome of the
intent factor correlates very strongly with the outcome of the overall test.
Sixty-seven of the 192 preliminary injunction and bench trial opinions found
that the intent factor favored the plaintiff. Of these 67 opinions, 65 found in
favor of the plaintiff in the overall test (and in the two outlying opinions,
the court found that the similarity factor favored the defendant).</span><span
style='line-height:120%;color:black'> Overall, across the circuits, five core
factors appear to drive the outcome of the likelihood of confusion test. In
order of importance, these factors are the similarity of the marks, the
defendant�s intent, the proximity of the goods, evidence of actual confusion,
and the strength of the plaintiff�s mark. The remaining factors appear, in
practice, to be largely irrelevant to the outcome of the test.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>3.&nbsp; <i>Why
Should Strong Marks Receive More Protection?</i> The conventional rationale for
according a greater scope of protection to strong marks is that, due to their
notoriety, they are more easily called to mind by similar marks. <i>See</i>

Meaning, Genericism, Fame, Confusion and Dilution</i>, 91 <span

shouldn�t strong marks actually require less protection? Consider the example

the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>coke</span>
mark countless times through their lives, are American consumers more or less
likely to detect slight differences between the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>coke</span>
mark and other similar marks?&nbsp; Some foreign courts have had the temerity
to suggest that exceptionally strong marks are less likely to be confused with
other marks.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Baywatch Production Co. Inc. v The Home

understood to exercise greater care in their purchasing decisions, and thus to
be comparatively less likely to be confused.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Heartsprings,

<p class=MsoNormal>5.&nbsp; <i>What About the Interests of Consumers Who Are </i>Not<i>
Confused?</i> In Michael Grynberg, <i>Trademark Litigation as Consumer Conflict</i>,
83 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>N.Y.U. L. Rev</span>. 60 (2008),
Grynberg argues:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Trademark litigation typically unfolds as a battle between
competing sellers who argue over whether the defendant's conduct is likely to
confuse consumers. This is an unfair fight. In the traditional narrative, the
plaintiff defends her trademark while simultaneously protecting consumers at
risk for confusion. The defendant, relatively speaking, stands alone. The
resulting �two-against-one� storyline gives short shrift to the interests of
nonconfused consumers who may have a stake in the defendant's conduct. As a
result, courts are too receptive to nontraditional trademark claims where the
case for consumer harm is questionable. Better outcomes are available by
appreciating trademark litigation's parallel status as a conflict between
consumers. This view treats junior and senior trademark users as proxies for
different consumer classes and recognizes that remedying likely confusion among
one group of consumers may cause harm to others. Focusing on the interests of
benefited and harmed consumers also minimizes the excessive weight given to
moral rhetoric in adjudicating trademark cases. Consideration of trademark's
consumer-conflict dimension is therefore a useful device for critiquing
trademark's expansion and assessing future doctrinal developments.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 60.&nbsp; Should courts be more solicitous
of the interests of sophisticated consumers who are in fact not confused and
may benefit from the information provided by the defendant�s conduct?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.&nbsp; <i><span style='line-height:120%'>Is It Necessary
for Courts Explicitly to Consider Each Factor?</span></i><span
style='line-height:120%'> District courts are generally required explicitly to
address each of the factors listed in their circuit�s multifactor test. If a
factor is irrelevant, the court must explain why. Failure to do so can result
in remand. See, for example, <i>Sabinsa Corp. v. Creative Compounds</i>, </span>609
F.3d 175<span style='line-height:120%'> (3d Cir. 2010), which reviewed a
district court opinion that addressed only three of the ten <i>Lapp</i> factors

that a district court may find that certain of the <i>Lapp</i> factors are
inapplicable or unhelpful in a particular case, the court must still explain
its choice not to employ those factors. Here, the District Court failed to
explain whether it viewed these remaining factors as neutral or irrelevant or
how it weighed and balanced the combined factors.� <i>Id</i>. at 183. Finding
that the facts were �largely undisputed,� <i>id</i>., the Third Circuit
declined to remand. Instead, it considered each of the ten <i>Lapp</i> factors
and reversed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.&nbsp; <i>A Two-Dimensional Model of Trademark Scope</i>.&nbsp;
Trademark lawyers typically speak of trademarks in two dimensions, as in the
trademark �<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>ford</span> for cars� or the
trademark �<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>ace</span> for hardware, but
not for bandages<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>.� </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;From
this we can derive a simple two-dimensional model of trademark infringement, as
in the figure below.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Barton Beebe, <i>The Semiotic Analysis of
Trademark Law</i>, 51 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>UCLA L. Rev.</span>
621, 654-655 (2004) &nbsp;&nbsp;This model conceives of any given trademark as
forming a point in a two-dimensional features space consisting of a trademark
dimension and a goods/services dimension.&nbsp; The trademark dimension
consists of a collapsed, one-dimensional continuum of all possible marks
arranged according to similarities of �sound, sight, and meaning.�&nbsp; The
goods/services dimension similarly consists of a one-dimensional continuum of
all possible goods and services arranged according to their degree of
similarity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Distance in this features space is a measure of two
concepts.&nbsp; First, distance is a measure of difference.&nbsp; The distance
between any two points represents the degree of difference between them.&nbsp;
Second, and related, distance is a measure of the likelihood of consumer
confusion.&nbsp; The closer two points are in features space, the greater the
proportion of consumers in the relevant consumer population who will likely confuse
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we have seen, in order to prevent consumer confusion as
to source, trademark law invests a trademark-product combination with some
broader scope of protection extending out from the point the combination forms
in this features space.&nbsp; Otherwise, a competitor could come very near to
that point, as in (<i>stout</i>, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>bass</span>)
or (<i>ale</i>, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>boss</span>) in the above
figure and, by confusing some proportion of consumers as to source, unfairly
appropriate as to those consumers the goodwill of the <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>bass</span> ale brand. The closer a junior user�s trademark-product
combination comes to the trademark-product combination of a senior user, the
greater the proportion of consumers who will confuse the junior�s with the
senior�s use.&nbsp; At some proximity to the senior�s use, trademark law
declares that too high a proportion of consumers are or will be confused, and
establishes a border, a property line, inside of which no competitor may
come.&nbsp; This border, enveloping any given trademark, describes the scope of
that trademark�s protection and the extent of the producer�s property right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For exceptionally well-known marks, what might be the shape
of the mark�s scope in this features space?&nbsp; Would it matter where the
mark falls on the <i>Abercrombie</i> spectrum?&nbsp; What would be the shape of
the scope of protection for <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>coca-cola</span>?&nbsp;
Can any other firm reasonably use that mark on any other good or service?&nbsp;
What would be the shape of the scope of <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>ford</span>
for automobiles or <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>apple</span> for high
technology goods and services?</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392164816">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey Evidence
and the Likelihood of Confusion</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is often said that survey evidence is routinely submitted
in trademark litigation, particularly on the issue of consumer confusion.&nbsp;
In a statement before Congress, the American Bar Association offered a typical
expression of this view: �survey evidence is traditionally one of the most
classic and most persuasive and most informative forms of trial evidence that
trademark lawyers utilize in both prosecuting and defending against trademark
claims of various sorts.� <i>Committee Print to Amend the Federal Trademark
Dilution Act: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Courts, the Internet, and
Intellectual Property of the Comm. on the Judiciary</i>, 108th Cong. 14 (2004)
(statement of Robert W. Sacoff, Chair, Section of Intellectual Property Law,
American Bar Association). In fact, empirical work suggests that survey
evidence plays a surprisingly small role in deciding most trademark cases. <i>See</i>
Barton <span>Beebe, <i>An Empirical Study of the Multifactor Tests for
Trademark Infringement</i>, 94 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Calif. L.
Rev</span>. 1581, 1641-42 (2006). The author studied all </span>federal court
opinions applying a likelihood of confusion multifactor test over a five-year
period from 2000 to 2004 and found that only 65 (20%) of the 331 opinions
addressed survey evidence, 34 (10%) credited the survey evidence, and 24 (7%)
ultimately ruled in favor of the outcome that the credited survey evidence
itself favored. Eleven (24%) of the 46 bench trial opinions addressed survey
evidence (with eight crediting it), while 24 (16%) of the 146 preliminary
injunction opinions addressed survey evidence (with 12 crediting it). <i>Id</i>.&nbsp;
<i>See also</i> Robert C. Bird &amp; Joel H. Steckel, <i>The Role of Consumer
Surveys in Trademark Infringement: Empirical Evidence from the Federal Courts</i>,
14 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Penn. J. Bus. L</span>. 1013 (2012)
(finding that survey evidence is infrequently used in trademark litigation and
suggesting that �the mere submission of a survey by a defendant appears to help
its case, while a plaintiff-submitted survey can potentially hurt its case if
the court deems it flawed�).&nbsp; <i>But see</i> Dan Sarel &amp; Howard
Marmorstein, <i>The Effect of Consumer Surveys and Actual&nbsp; Confusion
Evidence in Trademark Litigation: An Empirical Assessment</i>, 99 <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Trademark&nbsp; Rep</span>. 1416 (2009)
(finding survey evidence presented in one-third of the opinions studied and
that survey evidence had a substantial impact in cases involving dissimilar
goods). <i>Cf</i>. Shari Seidman Diamond &amp; David Franklyn, <i>Trademark
Surveys: An Undulating Path</i>, 92 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Texas
L. Rev</span>. __ (forthcoming 2014) (concluding based on a survey of trademark
practitioners that surveys can perform a significant role in settlement
negotiations).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nevertheless, in the small subset of trademark cases
involving high-stakes litigation or one or more well-funded parties, survey
evidence is customary, so much so that courts will sometimes draw an �adverse
inference� against a party for failing to present it. <i>See, e.g.</i>, Eagle
Snacks, Inc. v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., 625 F. Supp. 571, 583 (D.N.J. 1985)
(�Failure of a trademark owner to run a survey to support its claims of brand
significance and/or likelihood of confusion, where it has the financial means
of doing so, may give rise to the inference that the contents of the survey
would be unfavorable, and may result in the court denying relief.�); <i>but
see, e.g.</i>, Tools USA and Equipment Co. v. Champ Frame Straightening
Equipment Inc., 87 F.3d 654, 661 (4th Cir. 1996) (�Actual confusion can be
demonstrated by survey evidence, but contrary to [defendant�s] suggestion,
survey evidence is not necessarily the best evidence of actual confusion and
surveys are not required to prove likelihood of confusion.�). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When litigants do present survey evidence, courts� analysis
of this evidence can be painstaking, especially when the litigants present
dueling survey experts.&nbsp; In the following opinion, <i>Smith v. Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc</i>., 537 F.Supp.2d 1302 (N.D.Ga. 2008), the declaratory plaintiff
Charles Smith sought to criticize Wal-Mart�s effect on American communities and
workers by likening the retailer to the Nazi regime and, after Wal-Mart sent
Smith two cease and desist letters, to Al Qaeda. In particular, Smith created
and sold online through CafePress.com t-shirts and other merchandise
incorporating the term �Walocaust� and various Nazi insignia (shown below) or
the term �Wal-Qaeda� and various slogans and images (shown below).&nbsp;
Wal-Mart produced survey evidence to support the proposition that American
consumers would believe that Wal-Mart was selling the t-shirts or had otherwise
authorized their sale, or that in any case, Smith�s conduct tarnished Wal-Mart�s
trademark.&nbsp; Excerpted below is Judge Timothy Batten, Sr.�s extraordinarily
fine analysis of the surveys before him, which he conducted under the �actual
confusion� factor of the multifactor test for the likelihood of consumer
confusion.&nbsp; The analysis is lengthy and very detailed, but it is one with
which a serious student of trademark litigation should be familiar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few additional preliminary comments.&nbsp; First, the
surveys at issue are modified forms of the �<i>Eveready</i> format� for
likelihood of confusion surveys, based on the case <i>Union Carbide Corp. v.
Ever-Ready, Inc.</i>, 531 F.2d 366 (7th Cir. 1976), in which the Seventh
Circuit credited two surveys as strong evidence of the likelihood of confusion.&nbsp;
(Notwithstanding the spelling of �Ever-Ready� in the caption of the case, most
commentators, including McCarthy, refer to the survey format as the �<i>Eveready</i>
format.�)&nbsp; The surveys presented their respondents with the defendant�s
products and asked, in essence, �Who do you think puts out [the defendant�s
product]?�; �What makes you think so?�; �Please name any other products put out
by the same concern which puts out the [defendant�s product] shown here.� <i>Id</i>.
at 386.&nbsp; Second, the excerpt below addresses, in addition to the
likelihood of confusion issue, a cause of action for dilution by tarnishment of
Wal-Mart�s mark.&nbsp; We will address dilution more fully in Part II.C. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In reading through the excerpt, consider the following
question:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Do you find the <i>Eveready</i> format persuasive?&nbsp; How else
might you design a likelihood of confusion survey?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The �third set of questions� in the surveys, �aimed at testing
for confusion as to authorization or sponsorship, asked whether the company
that �put out� the shirt needed permission from another company to do so, and
if so, which company.� &nbsp;Is this an appropriate survey question to ask
consumers?</p>

evidence of actual consumer confusion. Instead, it presents two consumer
research studies conducted by Dr. Jacob Jacoby that purport to prove that
consumer confusion and damage to Wal&#8211;Mart�s reputation are likely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_I8d3ba7b7928f11e08b05fdf15589d"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a. The Jacoby Report</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Jacoby developed two surveys for Wal&#8211;Mart
that both purported to measure consumer confusion and dilution by tarnishment.
Specifically, the stated objectives of the research were (1) �To determine
whether (and if so, to what extent), when confronted with merchandise bearing
Mr. Smith�s designs either in person or via the Internet, prospective consumers
would be confused into believing that these items either came from Wal&#8211;Mart,
came from a firm affiliated with Wal&#8211;Mart, or had been authorized by
Wal&#8211;Mart,� and (2) �To determine whether (and if so, to what extent)
exposure to Mr. Smith�s designs would generate dilution via tarnishment.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Deeming it impractical to test all of Smith�s
designs, Jacoby chose instead to test two products as representative of all <a
name="co_pp_sp_4637_1318_1"></a>of Smith�s allegedly infringing
products&#8212;the white t-shirt with the word �WAL*OCAUST� in blue font over
the Nazi eagle clutching a yellow smiley face, and another white t-shirt that
depicted the word �WAL&#8211;QAEDA� in a blue font as part of the phrase
�SUPPORT OUR TROOPS. BOYCOTT WAL&#8211;QAEDA.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> He also tested consumer reactions to �control�
designs, which he compared to consumer responses to the Walocaust and
Wal&#8211;Qaeda designs. To develop the control for the Walocaust design,
Jacoby replaced the star with a hyphen and removed the smiley face from the yellow
circle, and for both the Walocaust and Wal&#8211;Qaeda controls, he substituted
�Z� for �W.� These substitutions resulted in control concepts entitled
�Zal-ocaust� and �Zal&#8211;Qaeda.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;Jacoby engaged a market research firm to test
each of the t-shirt designs in (1) a �product� study intended to test for
post-purchase confusion and tarnishment, and (2) a �website� study intended to
test for point-of-sale confusion and tarnishment.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For the �product� study, the interviewers presented
to each respondent one of <a name="co_pp_sp_4637_1319_1"></a>the four t-shirts
described above and asked the respondent to imagine seeing someone wearing the
shirt. The interviewer then asked a series of questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first three sets of questions were designed to
test for consumer confusion. The interviewers were directed to ask each of the
�likelihood of confusion� questions sequentially unless the respondent answered
�Sears,� �Wal&#8211;Mart,� �Youngblood�s� or �K&#8211;Mart,� in which case the
interviewer was to record the answer, skip the remaining confusion questions,
and go directly to the tarnishment questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;In the consumer confusion series, the first
set of questions tested for confusion as to source. The interviewer would ask
�which company or store� the respondent thought �put out� the shirt, and if the
respondent named a company or store, the interviewer then asked what about the
shirt made the respondent think the shirt was �put out� by that company or
store. The second set of questions, which dealt with confusion as to connection
or relationship, asked the respondent whether the company or store that �put
out� the shirt had some �business connection or relationship with another company�
and if so, with what company. The respondent was then asked why he or she
believed the companies had a business connection or relationship. A third set
of questions, aimed at testing for confusion as to authorization or
sponsorship, asked whether the company that �put out� the shirt needed
permission from another company to do so, and if so, which company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, if the respondent had not yet answered
�Sears,� �Wal&#8211;Mart,� �Youngblood�s� or �K&#8211;Mart� to any of the first
three sets of questions, he or she was then asked what the shirt made him or
her �think of� and then �which company or store� the shirt brought to mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The fifth set of questions, which tested for
dilution by tarnishment, were asked in reference to any company or store the
respondent mentioned in his or her answers to the first four sets of questions.
The first question asked whether seeing the shirt made the respondent more or
less likely to shop at the store he or she had named, and the second question
asked whether the perceived association with the store made the respondent more
or less likely to buy the shirt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The interviews for the website study were much like
those for the product study, except that instead of being shown the actual
shirts, the respondents were exposed to a simulation of Smith�s Walocaust
CafePress homepage, his Wal&#8211;Qaeda CafePress homepage or the associated
control homepage.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B020202015552342_ID"></a><a

all of the hyperlinks were removed from the homepages except for the one
hyperlink associated with the t-shirt that Jacoby had decided to test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Jacoby directed the interviewers to begin each
website interview by providing a URL to the respondent and asking the
respondent to imagine that the URL was a search term the respondent had heard
or seen somewhere and wanted to look up on the Internet. The interviewer would
then have the respondent sit at a computer and type the URL into the browser.
The URL would take the respondent to the simulated home page for testing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_4637_1320_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> The
interviewer would then direct the respondent to look at the screen and scroll
down the page �as [he or she] normally would� and click through to the first
t-shirt on the screen. The respondent was then directed to click on the �view
larger� box and look at the shirt as though he or she �found it interesting and
[was] considering whether or not to order it....� The interviewer would then
ask the respondent exactly the same series of questions posed in the product
study, including the same skip pattern to be applied in the event that the
respondent mentioned Sears, Wal&#8211;Mart, Youngblood�s or K&#8211;Mart in
response to any of the consumer confusion questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In order to be tallied as �confused,� the respondent
had to meet two tests. First, the respondent had to indicate either that the
shirt came from Wal&#8211;Mart (first confusion series), came from a company
that had some business connection or relationship with Wal&#8211;Mart (second
confusion series), or came from a source that required or obtained permission
from Wal&#8211;Mart (third confusion series). Second, the respondent had to
indicate that his or her reason for that understanding was either because of
the prefix �Wal,� the name (or equivalent), the smiley face, or the star after
the prefix �Wal.� Thus, a respondent who believed that there was a connection
between Wal&#8211;Mart and the t-shirt that he or she was shown but who did not
mention the prefix �Wal,� the name (or equivalent), the smiley face, or the
star, would not be counted as �confused.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Any respondent who perceived an association between
Wal&#8211;Mart and the t-shirt that he or she was shown and reported that the
perceived association either made the respondent less likely to shop at
Wal&#8211;Mart or more likely to buy that t-shirt was deemed to satisfy the
requirement for dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The field interviewers returned 322 completed
interviews for the product study and 335 for the website study. Three responses
were eliminated from the sample after the research company conducted a review
to ensure that each respondent was qualified to participate in the study and
that the questionnaires had been completed properly. The research company then
sent the name and phone number of each of the interview respondents to an

Jacoby survey. He argues that the survey is inadmissible because it (1) failed
to identify the relevant consumer universe or used a consumer universe that was
substantially overbroad; (2) failed to replicate shopping conditions as
consumers would encounter them in the marketplace; (3) was improperly leading;
(4) violated the survey structure protocol necessary to comply with
double-blind standards; and (5) failed to establish a relevant factual basis
for Wal&#8211;Mart�s dilution by tarnishment claims. Smith further argues that
even if the Court admits the survey, its consideration should be limited to
only the two tested designs, despite Jacoby�s claim that they are
representative of all the designs Wal&#8211;Mart seeks to enjoin.</p>

an initial matter, the Court observes that Smith does not take issue with
Jacoby�s qualifications to design and conduct a consumer confusion survey and
to analyze its results. It is undisputed that Jacoby is a nationally renowned
trademark survey expert who has testified hundreds of times. Smith contends,
however, that Jacoby was unqualified to conduct this particular survey because
he �lacks knowledge, experience, [and] sophistication� with regard to products
marketed exclusively over the Internet and that as a result Jacoby�s survey
protocol contained significant flaws.</p>

experience, the Court concludes that Jacoby is qualified to design and conduct
a consumer survey and to testify about its results. To the extent that Jacoby�s
purported lack of experience with surveys concerning goods sold exclusively
online may have led him to test the wrong universe or to fail to replicate the
shopping experience, as Smith has alleged, these factors will be examined when
the Court evaluates the trustworthiness of the survey.</p>

replication of marketplace conditions&#8212;that he claims resulted <a

people reach and interact with websites. Smith uses Rosenblatt�s expertise on
Internet user experience and navigation to support his <i>Daubert</i> argument
that because Jacoby surveyed an improperly broad universe and his survey design
did not approximate the actual consumer marketplace experience, the Jacoby
studies are legally insufficient to prove consumer confusion or trademark
dilution. Thus, Smith argues, the studies should be afforded little, if any,

irrelevant. It also argues that the portion of Rosenblatt�s report that is
devoted to a general analysis of people�s Internet browsing habits rather than

qualify for either of Jacoby�s surveys, the respondent had to be over thirteen
years of age and had to have in the past year bought, or would in the coming
year consider buying, bumper stickers, t-shirts or coffee mugs with words,
symbols or designs on them. To qualify for the web-based point-of-purchase
study, the respondent must also have (1) used the Internet in the past month to
search for information about products or services and (2) either (a) in the
past year used the Internet to buy or search for information about bumper
stickers, t-shirts or coffee mugs with words, symbols or designs on them, or
(b) in the coming year would consider buying over the Internet bumper stickers,
t-shirts or coffee mugs with words, symbols or designs on them. Wal&#8211;Mart
maintains that Jacoby�s universe selection was proper. Smith counters that it
was overly broad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the universe Jacoby selected would include
purchasers of Smith�s Walocaust or Wal&#8211;Qaeda merchandise, the Court finds
that it is significantly overbroad. Because Smith�s merchandise was available
only through his CafePress webstores and the links to his CafePress webstores
from his Walocaust and Wal&#8211;Qaeda websites, it is likely that only a small
percentage of the consumers in the universe selected by Jacoby would be
potential purchasers of Smith�s products. A survey respondent who purchases
bumper stickers, t-shirts or coffee mugs with words, symbols or designs on them
may buy such merchandise because the imprint represents his or her school,
company, favorite sports team, cartoon character, social group, or any of
hundreds of other interests or affiliations; he or she may have no interest at
all in purchasing merchandise containing messages about Wal&#8211;Mart, pro or
con. The respondent may buy from brick-and-mortar stores or well-known
retailers with Internet storefronts without being aware of Smith�s website or
CafePress, or may have little interest in buying such merchandise over the
Internet at all. Therefore, a respondent who clearly falls within Jacoby�s

allow adherents to the Weight Watchers program to use Lean Cuisine entrees in

likelihood of confusion survey, also conducted by Jacoby, identified the
universe as �women between the ages of 18 and 55 who have purchased frozen food
entrees in the past six months and who have tried to lose weight through diet
and/or exercise in the past year.� <a
href="http://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;serNum=1990131306&amp;originationContext=document&amp;vr=3.0&amp;rs=cblt1.0&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.UserEnteredCitation)"><i><span

found that the universe was overbroad because the screener had not limited it
to dieters, but also had included respondents who may have tried to lose weight
by exercise only. The court concluded that as a result the survey likely
included respondents who were not potential consumers, and because �[r]espondents
who are not potential consumers may well be less likely to be aware of and to
make relevant distinctions when reading ads than those who are potential
consumers,� that portion of the survey universe may have failed to make
�crucial� distinctions in the likelihood of confusion testing. <a

the court found that the universe in a survey designed to show a likelihood of
confusion between a wine producer�s wines and a competitor�s wines was
overbroad. The junior mark user�s product, like Smith�s, was distributed
through limited channels; the challenged wines were sold only through the
junior user�s tasting room and website, while the senior mark holder sold its
wines through mass retail channels. The survey expert defined <a
name="co_pp_sp_4637_1327_1"></a>the universe as Michigan consumers over
twenty-one years of age who had either purchased a bottle of wine in the
five-to-fourteen dollar price range in the last three months or who expected to
purchase a bottle of wine in that price range in the next three months. The
court held that a purchaser of a wine in that price range would, in general, be
a potential consumer of the competitor�s wine only if the purchaser planned to
buy from some winery�s tasting room or website and that the survey universe
therefore was overbroad and entitled to little weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith contends that Jacoby�s point-of-purchase
study, which purported to measure consumer confusion over merchandise that
Smith sold exclusively online, was improperly designed because it failed to
take into account typical consumer Internet behavior. Wal&#8211;Mart does not
contradict the expert testimony Smith proffers regarding consumer Internet
behavior but instead maintains that it is irrelevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Jacoby�s point-of-purchase survey called for
interviewers to provide each respondent with specific �search terms� that would
take the respondent to a simulation of one of Smith�s websites. The respondent
was asked to pretend that the resulting web page was of interest and to act
accordingly (looking at the page and scrolling through it as the respondent
would �normally� do), and then was directed to scroll down the page, below the
first screen, and click on a specific t-shirt link. The respondent was not
asked what message he or she took from the website or whether the website was
in fact of interest. The survey protocol also gave the respondent no choice but
to scroll down to the next screen and click on the t-shirt link, the only live
link in the simulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In presenting Smith�s website and directing the
survey respondents to click on one specific t-shirt link, Jacoby�s survey
design presumed that all consumers who might be interested in a printed
t-shirt, mug or bumper sticker would be equally likely to happen across Smith�s
designs, regardless of the respondent�s level of interest in the messages on
Smith�s webpage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although, as Wal&#8211;Mart points out, it is
possible that some consumers may view web pages randomly and may scroll through
and clink on links on pages that are not of interest to them, the Court finds
that the survey protocol did not sufficiently reflect actual marketplace
conditions or typical consumer shopping behavior and therefore was unlikely to
have elicited a shopping mindset that would have allowed Jacoby to accurately
gauge actual consumer confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because Smith�s merchandise was available only
through his CafePress webstores and the links to his CafePress webstores from
his Walocaust and Wal&#8211;Qaeda websites, it is unlikely that many consumers
randomly happen across Smith�s products. According to Rosenblatt�s
uncontroverted <a name="co_pp_sp_4637_1328_1"></a>testimony, people do not come
to websites randomly, and they do not move within websites randomly. A great
majority of Internet users arrive at a particular website after searching
specific terms via an Internet search engine or by following links from another
website. The user makes a judgment based on contextual cues&#8212;what is shown
about a prospective website from the text of a search result or what is said
about a prospective website in the hyperlinked words and surrounding text of
the website currently being viewed&#8212;in determining where to surf next. He
moves from website to website, he moves within websites, and he performs
actions such as signing a petition&#8212;or buying a product&#8212;by making
choices based on what he sees and whether what he sees leads him to believe
that going to the next page or following a link to another website will bring
him to something he is interested in seeing, doing or buying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the marketplace, the visitor would be presented
with a screen full of Smith�s anti-Wal-Mart messages. Consumers who were
interested in the messages on Smith�s web pages would be motivated to choose
the links that would eventually lead to his products, while those who were
uninterested in Smith�s messages would simply leave the page. Because the
survey protocol directed the respondents to �pretend� to be interested in
Smith�s anti-Wal-Mart homepages and then directed them to click on a specific
link, there is no assurance that the respondent actually read the homepage or
would have been interested enough in it to be motivated to click on the t-shirt
link. <i>See </i><a

the court criticized the proffered survey because it did not take into account
typical consumer behavior:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Actual purchasers of a boat would not hastily read an
advertisement, nor would a potential purchaser read it carelessly. A reasonable
man, anticipating the purchase of a boat, would peruse the material at least
well enough to note the manufacturer as being �Cadillac Marine &amp; Boat
Company, 406 Seventh Street, Cadillac, Michigan.� Also, most buyers would want
to see the boat itself before making a purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;Although the purchase of a t-shirt obviously does not
involve the same level of financial consideration a consumer typically makes
when buying a boat, a consumer is likely to consider the meaning of an
imprinted t-shirt such as Smith�s before wearing it in public. A reasonable
person who was considering buying a t-shirt that references Al&#8211;Qaeda or
the Holocaust would likely read the associated webpage at least well enough to
see the harsh criticism of Wal&#8211;Mart and the prominent disclaimer
dispelling any notion of a possible association with the company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ii. Structural Flaws</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>54</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith further alleges that the Jacoby study suffers
from several structural flaws that diminish the trustworthiness of the results
of both the web-based point-of-sale portion and the post-purchase t-shirt
portion of the survey. He contends that (1) both the structure of the survey
and the wording of several questions suggested the answers Wal&#8211;Mart
wanted, and (2) the survey results should not be presumed to represent consumer
reaction to any of the challenged merchandise that was not actually tested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith hired Dr. Richard Teach as a rebuttal witness
to point out deficiencies in Jacoby�s website study survey methodology. Teach
is an emeritus marketing professor and former dean at the Georgia Tech School
of Business who has designed and conducted over one hundred surveys, including
about fifty buyer surveys, and has taught survey methodology, statistics and
related courses. Teach testifies that he agrees with Rosenblatt�s testimony and
also offers criticisms of his own. Smith uses Teach�s survey expertise to
support his <i>Daubert</i> argument that because the survey protocol contains
multiple technical flaws, the results are unreliable and hence should be
afforded very light evidentiary value if not completely excluded from evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Wal&#8211;Mart moves to exclude Teach�s testimony,
supporting its motion with arguments much like those it used in its motion to exclude
Rosenblatt�s testimony�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>57</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court finds�that his extensive experience
designing and evaluating surveys qualifies him to provide testimony about
technical flaws in the design of Jacoby�s study and the impact of those flaws
on the trustworthiness of Jacoby�s reported results.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>58</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> [T]o the extent that Teach�s testimony focuses on
general survey methodology, whether Jacoby�s survey protocol deviated from
standard methodology, and what impact any deviations may have had on the
trustworthiness of Jacoby�s reported results, Wal&#8211;Mart�s motion to
exclude it is DENIED.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) Leading Survey Structure and Questions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>59</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith argues that both the structure of the survey
and the wording of several questions suggested the answers Wal&#8211;Mart
wanted. Wal&#8211;Mart, of course, contends that Jacoby�s survey presented no
such risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<a name="co_anchor_I8d3ba7bf928f11e08b05fdf15589d"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(i) Double&#8211;Blind Survey Design</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>60</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To ensure objectivity in the administration of the
survey, it is standard practice to conduct survey interviews in such a way as
to ensure that �both the interviewer and the respondent are blind to the
sponsor of the survey and its purpose.� REFERENCE MANUAL at 266. The parties
agree that double-blind conditions are essential because if the respondents
know what the interviewer wants, they may try to please the interviewer by
giving the desired answer, and if the interviewer knows what his employer
wants, he may <a name="co_pp_sp_4637_1331_1"></a>consciously or unconsciously
bias the survey through variations in the wording or the tone of his questions.
<i>See id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>61</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith argues that the skip pattern included in
Jacoby�s survey hinted to the interviewers that Wal&#8211;Mart was the survey�s
sponsor. The survey protocol directed the interviewers to skip to the final
tarnishment question, question five, if the respondent gave any one of four
specific store names&#8212;Sears, Wal&#8211;Mart, K&#8211;Mart or
Youngblood�s&#8212;to any of the first three questions. Similarly, if the
respondent did not give any of those four names in response to the first three
questions, the interviewer was directed to ask �what other companies or stores�
the stimulus t-shirt brought to mind, and only if the respondent answered with
one of the four names was the interviewer to ask question five, the dilution question.
The text on both of the tested t-shirts began with the prefix �Wal,� and
Wal&#8211;Mart was the only one of the four listed names that began with that
prefix.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>62</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith argues that this series of questions combined
with the t-shirt stimulus subtly informed the interviewers not only that a
store name was desired, but also that a particular store
name&#8212;Wal-Mart&#8212;was sought. Thus, Smith contends, because the survey
failed to meet the double-blind requirement, it was not conducted in an
objective manner and must be excluded for what must therefore be biased
results. <i>See</i> REFERENCE MANUAL at 248 (noting that poorly formed
questions may lead to distorted responses and increased error and therefore may
be the basis for rejecting a survey).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>63</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Wal&#8211;Mart argues that the skip patterns
followed proper protocol and that even if the interviewers guessed that
Wal&#8211;Mart was involved, there could be no risk of bias because (1)
interviewers are professionally trained and adhere to extremely high ethical
standards, and (2) it was impossible to determine from the design of the study
who sponsored the study and for which side of a dispute the survey evidence was
to be proffered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>64</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on the facts that (1) both of the tested
t-shirts include the prefix �Wal� and (2) the only store on the specified list
of four that included that same prefix was Wal&#8211;Mart, it is safe to
surmise that the interviewers at least suspected that Wal&#8211;Mart was
involved in the survey in some manner. Aside from a common sense assumption
that the party with deep pockets and reason to be insulted by the tested
concepts was likely to have sponsored the research, however, the interviewers
had no way to know who was the proponent of the research and who was the
opponent. Thus, although the survey design may have breached generally accepted
double-blind protocol to some degree, because the breach offered little risk of
bias toward one party or the other the Court finds this issue to be of little
import in its trustworthiness determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_I8d3ba7c0928f11e08b05fdf15589d"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(ii) Leading Questions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>65</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith also argues that the wording of Jacoby�s
confusion questions was improperly leading. Although the challenged t-shirts
were created and offered for sale by Charles Smith, an individual, via his
CafePress webstore, the survey asked about sponsorship only in the context of companies
or stores, such as in the survey�s lead question, which asked, �[W]hich company
or store do you think <a name="co_pp_sp_4637_1332_1"></a>puts out this shirt?�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B027272015552342_ID"></a> Smith contends that this
wording suggested to the respondent that the interviewer was looking for the
name of a company or store, which would lead the respondent away from the
answer that the shirt was put out by an individual who was criticizing a
company. Wal&#8211;Mart counters that because Smith�s merchandise was sold
through his CafePress webstores, the questions were accurately worded and thus
not misleading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>66</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court agrees with Smith that the disputed
questions improperly led respondents to limit their answers to companies or
stores. Though Smith did offer his merchandise through his CafePress webstore,
as Wal&#8211;Mart argues, the Court finds this characterization disingenuous;
the party Wal&#8211;Mart sued for offering the Walocaust and Wal&#8211;Qaeda
merchandise for sale is not a company or a store, but instead Charles Smith, an
individual. Furthermore, Wal&#8211;Mart has failed to point to any authority
supporting the use of the �company or store� language in a consumer �likelihood
of confusion� apparel survey or any such surveys previously conducted by
Jacoby. Thus, the Court must consider this weakness in determining the
admissibility or evidentiary weight to be accorded the survey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<a name="co_anchor_I8d3ba7c1928f11e08b05fdf15589d"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) Representativeness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(i) Testing Stimuli</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>67</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith also argues that the Jacoby survey results should
not be presumed to represent consumer reaction to any of the challenged
merchandise that was not actually tested. Jacoby limited his surveys to testing
two specific t-shirts (the Wal*ocaust smiley eagle shirt and the �SUPPORT OUR
TROOPS� Wal&#8211;Qaeda shirt), and the conclusions stated in his report were
narrowly drawn to refer to the tested t-shirts. At his deposition, however, he
stated that because the tested shirts were �reasonably representative� of all
the shirts that included the prefix �Wal� and the star, as in Wal*ocaust, or
the prefix �Wal� and a hyphen, as in Wal&#8211;Qaeda, his results could be
extrapolated from the tested t-shirts to all of the challenged t-shirts that
shared those features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>68</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Jacoby�s own deposition testimony supplies a
fitting framework for analyzing this issue. When declining to offer an opinion
about whether consumers would also be confused over the sponsorship of Smith�s
Walocaust website, Jacoby stated that consumers respond differently to a given
stimulus depending on the context in which is it presented, and because his
survey tested only Smith�s CafePress webstores, his survey provided him with no
data upon which to answer the question about consumer confusion regarding
Smith�s website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>69</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying the same reasoning, the Court finds that
test results from one Walocaust or Wal&#8211;Qaeda t-shirt provide no data upon
which to estimate consumer confusion regarding another Walocaust or
Wal&#8211;Qaeda t-shirt. A consumer confused about the sponsorship of a shirt
that says �SUPPORT OUR TROOPS [.] BOYCOTT WAL&#8211;QAEDA� may easily grasp the
commentary in the more straightforwardly derogatory �WAL&#8211;QAEDA[.] Freedom
Haters ALWAYS� concept. Similarly, a consumer confused over the sponsorship of
a �Walocaust� shirt paired with an eagle and a smiley face might&nbsp; <a
name="co_pp_sp_4637_1333_1"></a>have a crystal clear understanding of the
word�s meaning when it is superimposed over a drawing of a
Wal&#8211;Mart&#8211;like building paired with a sign that advertises family
values and discounted alcohol, firearms, and tobacco or when it is presented
along with the additional text �The World is Our Labor Camp. Walmart Sucks.� As
a result, this weakness will also impact the Court�s assessment of the survey�s
evidentiary value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<a name="co_anchor_I8d3ba7c2928f11e08b05fdf15589d"></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(ii) Sample Size and Selection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>70</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Smith also challenges the survey�s small sample
size; the Court additionally notes that Jacoby�s study employed mall-intercept
methodology, which necessarily results in a non-random survey sample.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>71</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is true that the majority of surveys presented
for litigation purposes do, in fact, include small and non-random samples that
are not projectible to the general population or susceptible to evaluations of
statistical significance. <a

�nonprobability �mall intercept� surveys are sufficiently reliable to be

evidence under <a

Consequently, although this is a close case, the Court concludes that the
better option is to admit the survey evidence and to consider the survey�s
flaws in determining the evidentiary weight to assign the survey in the
likelihood of confusion analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>77</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Court finds, however, that because the survey
tested only the �SUPPORT OUR TROOPS[.] BOYCOTT WAL&#8211;QAEDA� t-shirt and the
Walocaust eagle t-shirt, it has no relevance to any of Smith�s other
Wal&#8211;Mart&#8211;related concepts. The Court agrees with Jacoby that
context matters&#8212;a lot&#8212;and therefore will not consider Jacoby�s
survey as evidence of likelihood of confusion with regard to the words
�Walocaust� and �Wal&#8211;Qaeda� in general; the study is admissible only as
to the two concepts that Jacoby actually tested. <i>See</i> <a

severely and materially flawed, it may not be sufficient to establish a genuine
issue of material fact even if it purports to show evidence of actual
confusion). Jacoby surveyed an overbroad universe, failed to adequately
replicate the shopping experience, and asked leading questions. He also
surveyed a non-random sample that in any case was too small to allow the
results to be projected upon the general market. Thus, the Court finds that the
Jacoby survey is so flawed that it does not establish a genuine issue <a
name="co_pp_sp_4637_1335_1"></a>of material fact with regard to actual
confusion, much less <i>prove</i> actual confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>79</span></span><span

is not dispositive, however; the Eleventh Circuit has moved away from relying

even though actual confusion is the best evidence of likelihood of confusion. <a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><b>Questions and Comments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp; <i>The Authorization or Permission Question</i>.&nbsp;
You will recall that the third group of questions in the surveys at issue in <i>Smith
v. Wal-Mart</i> asked respondents if they thought the company that �put out�
the defendant�s products needed permission from another company to do so, and
if so, which company.&nbsp; Isn�t this the very question that the judge is
trying to decide in the case?&nbsp; Why should we ask survey respondents for
their view on what is in essence a legal question?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp; <i>Alternative Survey Formats</i>.&nbsp; Two other
methods of surveying for the likelihood of consumer confusion are of particular
interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The �<i>Squirt</i> format�.&nbsp; In <i>Squirt Co. v. Seven-Up Co</i>.,
628 F.2d 1086 (8th Cir. 1980), survey respondents were played radio
advertisements for <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>squirt</span> and <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>quirst</span> soft drinks and two other
products.&nbsp; The respondents were then asked: (1) �Do you think <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>squirt</span> and <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>quirst</span> are put out by the same company or by different
companies?�, and (2) �What makes you think that?�&nbsp; This method, consisting
of either seriatim or simultaneous exposure to the plaintiff�s and defendant�s
marks, is especially beneficial for a plaintiff whose mark may not be well-known
to the survey respondents.&nbsp; However, some courts have rejected this survey
method on the ground that it makes the respondents �artificially aware� of the
plaintiff�s mark and does not approximate market conditions. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Kargo
Global, Inc. v. Advance Magazine Publishers, Inc</i>., No. 06 Civ. 550, 2007 WL
2258688, at *8 (S.D. N.Y. 2007).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The �<i>Exxon</i> format�.&nbsp; In <i>Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor
Exchange of Houston, Inc</i>., 628 F2d 500 (5th Cir. 1980), survey respondents
were shown a photograph of one of the defendant�s signs bearing its Texon
trademark.&nbsp; The respondents were then asked: �What is the first thing that
comes to mind when looking at this sign?�, and �What was there about the sign
that made you say that?�&nbsp; If the respondents did not name a company in
response to the first set of questions, they were then asked: �What is the
first <em><span style='font-family:Cambria'>company</span></em> that comes to
mind when you look at this sign?� (emphasis in original survey script) and
�What was there about the sign that made you mention (COMPANY)?� Courts have
proven to be less receptive to this �word association� method of surveying for
consumer confusion.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Major League Baseball Properties
v. Sed Non Olet Denarius, Ltd</i>., 817 F. Supp. 1103, 1122 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)
(�[T]he issue here is not whether defendants' name brings to mind any other
name�. Rather, the issue here is one of actual confusion. Plaintiff's survey
questions regarding association are irrelevant to the issue of actual
confusion.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Itamar Simonson, <i>The Effect of Survey Method on Likelihood
of Confusion Estimates: Conceptual Analyses and Empirical Test</i>, 83 <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Trademark Rep</span>. 364 (1993), Simonson
compared the results of five methods of surveying for the likelihood of
confusion, including a simple form of the <i>Eveready</i> format, the <i>Squirt</i>
format, and the <i>Exxon</i> format.&nbsp; He found that the <i>Exxon</i>
format �tends to overestimate the likelihood of confusion, often by a
significant amount,� <i>id</i>. at 385, and that the Squirt format, as
expected, �can have a significant effect on confusion estimates when the
awareness level of the senior mark is low.� <i>Id</i>. at 386.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp; <i>What Percentage of Confusion is Enough?</i>
�Figures in the range of 25% to 50% have been viewed as solid support for a
finding of a likelihood of confusion.� <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span>
� 32:188. Still often cited by plaintiff�s with especially weak cases, <i>Jockey
International, Inc. v. Burkard</i>, No 74 Civ. 123, 1975 WL 21128 (S.D. Cal.
1975), found that survey evidence of 11.4 percent supported a likelihood of
confusion. <i>But see Georgia-Pacific Consumer Product LP v. Myers Supply, Inc</i>.,
No. 08 Civ. 6086, 2009 WL 2192721 (W.D. Ark. 2009) (survey evidence of 11.4
percent confusion does not support a likelihood of confusion).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392164818">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Sponsorship or
Affiliation� Confusion</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the surveys at issue in <i>Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores</i> showed,
trademark law generally recognizes forms of consumer confusion that may best be
characterized as consumer confusion with respect to the plaintiff�s
�sponsorship� of the defendant or at least some form of �affiliation� between
the plaintiff and the defendant.&nbsp; The language of Lanham Act � 43(a), 15
U.S.C. � 1125(a), lends itself especially to this extremely broad notion of
consumer confusion.&nbsp; Recall that � 43(a) applies to both registered and
unregistered marks:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(a) Civil action</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any
goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term,
name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation
of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading
representation of fact, which&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent style='margin-left:.6in'>(A) is likely to cause
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,
connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the
origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person, or</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent style='margin-left:.6in'>(B) in commercial
advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities,
or geographic origin of his or her or another person�s goods, services, or
commercial activities,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>shall be liable in a civil action by any person who
believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trademark scholars have been highly critical of �sponsorship
or affiliation� confusion.&nbsp; Presented below is an excerpt from Mark A.
Lemley &amp; Mark McKenna, <i>Irrelevant Confusion</i>, 62 <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Stan. L. Rev</span>. 413, 417-422 (2010), which
collects some of the most egregious examples of plaintiffs� threats to sue and
of courts� finding of �sponsorship or affiliation� confusion.&nbsp; Note that
many of the unauthorized uses described in the excerpt could quite likely have
qualified as �nominative fair uses�, a form of trademark fair use that we will
address in Part III on defenses to trademark infringement.&nbsp; Thus the
student will have to endure a degree of suspense until we get there.&nbsp; But
we consider �sponsorship or affiliation� confusion here because from the
perspective of defendants (and from many of those who support free speech),
defendants should never have to resort to this <i>defense</i> of nominative
fair use because courts should not find confusion in the first place on the
plaintiff�s side of the case.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2006, back when it was good, NBC�s hit show <i>Heroes</i>
depicted an indestructible cheerleader sticking her hand down a kitchen garbage
disposal and mangling it (the hand quickly regenerated). It was an Insinkerator
brand garbage disposal, though you might have had to watch the show in slow
motion to notice; the brand name was visible for only a couple of seconds.
Emerson Electric, owner of the Insinkerator brand, sued NBC, alleging the
depiction of its product in an unsavory light was both an act of trademark
dilution and was likely to cause consumers to believe Emerson had permitted the
use. NBC denied any wrongdoing, but it obscured the Insinkerator name when it
released the DVD and Web versions of the episode.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_g_ID0ENWAE_1"></a>Most of these examples involve
threats of suit, and they could be dismissed <a name="co_pp_sp_1239_418_1"></a>simply
as overreaching by a few aggressive trademark owners. But these threats were
not isolated incidents, and they shouldn�t be quickly ignored. The recipients

take the asserted claims seriously because courts have sometimes been persuaded
to shut down very similar uses. In 1998, for instance, New Line Productions was
set to release a comedy about a beauty pageant that took place at a
farm-related fair in Minnesota. New Line called the movie <i>Dairy Queens</i>

that recipients of cease and desist letters from mark owners have to take the
objections seriously. Indeed many simply cave in and change their practices
rather than face the uncertainty of a lawsuit. The producers of the TV show <i>Felicity</i>

<p class=Blockquote>[W]e argue that courts can begin to rein in some of these
excesses by focusing their attention on confusion that is actually relevant to
purchasing decisions. Uses of a trademark that cause confusion about actual
source or about responsibility for quality will often impact purchasing
decisions, so courts should presume materiality and impose liability when there
is evidence such confusion is likely. Uses alleged to cause confusion about
more nebulous relationships, on the other hand, are more analogous to false advertising
claims, and those uses should be actionable only when a plaintiff can prove the
alleged confusion is material to consumers� decision making.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Network Automation (�Network�) and Advanced Systems
Concepts (�Systems�) are both in the business of selling job scheduling and
management software, and both advertise on the Internet. Network sells its
software under the mark AutoMate, while Systems' product is sold under the
registered trademark ActiveBatch. Network decided to advertise its product by
purchasing certain keywords, such as �ActiveBatch,� which when keyed into
various search engines, most prominently Google and Microsoft Bing, produce a
results page showing �www. Network Automation. com� as a sponsored link.
Systems' objection to Network's use of its trademark to interest viewers in
Network's website gave rise to this trademark infringement action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court was confronted with the question
whether Network's use of ActiveBatch to advertise its products was a clever and
legitimate use of readily available technology, such as Google's AdWords, or a
likely violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1114. The court found a
likelihood of initial interest confusion by applying the eight factors we
established more than three decades ago in <i>AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats,</i>
599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.1979), and reasoning that the three most important
factors in �cases involving the Internet� are (1) the similarity of the marks;
(2) the relatedness of the goods; and (3) the marketing channel used. The court
therefore issued a preliminary injunction against Network's use of the mark
ActiveBatch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mindful that the <i>sine qua non</i> of trademark
infringement is consumer confusion, and that the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors are
but a nonexhaustive list of factors relevant to determining the likelihood of
consumer confusion, we conclude that Systems' showing of a likelihood of
confusion was insufficient to support injunctive relief. Therefore, we vacate
the injunction and reverse and remand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Systems is a software engineering and consulting
firm founded in 1981. It has used the ActiveBatch trademark since 2000, and it
procured federal registration of the mark in 2001. Systems markets ActiveBatch
software to businesses, which use the product to centralize and manage
disparate tasks. Network is a software company founded in 1997 under the name
Unisyn. Its signature product, AutoMate, also provides businesses with job
scheduling, event monitoring, and related services. Network has approximately
15,000 total customers, and between 4,000 and 5,000 active customers, including
Fortune 500 companies and mid-sized and small firms. The cost of a license to
use AutoMate typically ranges from $995 to $10,995. There is no dispute that
Network and Systems are direct competitors, or that ActiveBatch and AutoMate
are directly competing products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Google AdWords is a program through which the
search engine sells �keywords,� or search terms that trigger the display of a
sponsor's advertisement. When a user enters a keyword, Google displays the
links generated by its own algorithm in the main part of the page, along with
the advertisements in a separate �sponsored links� section next to or above the
objective results. <i>See</i> Appendix A.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[45]</span></span></span></a>
Multiple advertisers can purchase the same keyword, and Google charges sponsors
based on the number of times users click on an ad to travel from the search
results page to the advertiser's own website. Network purchased �ActiveBatch�
as a keyword from Google AdWords and a comparable program offered by
Microsoft's Bing search engine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a result, consumers searching for business
software who enter �ActiveBatch� as a search term would locate a results page
where the top objective results are links to Systems' own website and various
articles about the product. <i>See</i> Appendix A. In the �Sponsored Links� or
�Sponsored Sites� section of the page, above or to the right of the regular
results, users see Network's advertisement, either alone or alongside Systems'
own sponsored link. The text of Network's advertisements begin with phrases
such as �Job Scheduler,� �Intuitive Job Scheduler,� or �Batch Job Scheduling,�
and end with the company's web site address, www.Network Automation.com. The
middle line reads: �Windows Job Scheduling + Much More. Easy to Deploy,
Scalable. D/L Trial.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On November 16, 2009, Systems demanded that Network
cease and desist from using the ActiveBatch mark in its search engine
advertising, as it was not �authorized to use these marks in commerce.� In a
second letter, Systems explained that Network's use of ActiveBatch in its
Google AdWords keyword advertising infringed Systems' trademark rights by
deceiving customers into believing that Network's software products were
affiliated with Systems' products. Systems threatened litigation unless Network
immediately ceased all use of Systems' mark, including removing the mark from
the Google AdWords Program. Network responded that its use of the ActiveBatch
mark was non-infringing as a matter of law, and filed this lawsuit seeking a
declaratory judgment of non-infringement. Systems counterclaimed on February
22, 2010, alleging trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1114(1), and moved for a preliminary injunction against Network's use of the
ActiveBatch mark pending trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court granted injunctive relief on
April 30, 2010. Noting that the parties did not dispute the validity or
ownership of the ActiveBatch mark, the district court ruled that Systems was
likely to succeed in satisfying the Lanham Act's �use in commerce� requirement
by showing that Network �used� the mark when it purchased advertisements from
search engines triggered by the term �ActiveBatch.� Applying the eight-factor <i>Sleekcraft</i>
test for source confusion,<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[46]</span></span></span></a>
the district court emphasized three factors it viewed as significant for �cases
involving the Internet�: the similarity of the marks, relatedness of the goods
or services, and simultaneous use of the Web as a marketing channel. The
district court concluded that all three factors favored Systems: Network used
the identical mark to sell a directly competing product, and both advertised on
the Internet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court also concluded that Systems'
mark was strong because, as a federally registered trademark, ActiveBatch is
presumptively distinctive. It concluded that the degree of consumer care
suggested likely confusion because �there is generally a low degree of care
exercised by Internet consumers.� Moreover, Network intentionally used Systems'
mark to advertise its own product. Finally, the district court noted that
neither party introduced evidence of actual confusion, and that the likelihood
of product expansion was not relevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court also analyzed whether Network
infringed Systems' mark by creating initial interest confusion&#8212;as opposed
to source confusion&#8212;which �occurs when the defendant uses the plaintiff's
trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention, even
though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion.�
(quoting <i>Nissan Motor Co. v. Nissan Computer Corp.,</i> 378 F.3d 1002, 1018
(9th Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted)). Because the district court found
that Network's advertisements did not clearly divulge their source, it
concluded that consumers might be confused into unwittingly visiting Network's
website, allowing the company to �impermissibly capitalize[ ] on [Systems']
goodwill.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on its analysis of the <i>Sleekcraft</i>
factors and its finding of likely initial interest confusion, the district
court concluded that Systems had a strong likelihood of success on the merits
of its trademark infringement claim. It then presumed a likelihood of
irreparable harm, and concluded that the balance of hardships and the public
interest favored Systems. Following entry of the preliminary injunction,
Network timely appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III. DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must
establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to
suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance
of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public
interest.� <i>Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 555 U.S. 7, 129
S.Ct. 365, 374, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). Network argues that the district court
erred by ruling that Systems was likely to succeed on the merits of its
trademark claim, and by then presuming a likelihood of irreparable injury. It
also contends that the preliminary injunction is overbroad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement
under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1114, a party �must prove: (1) that it has a
protectible ownership interest in the mark; and (2) that the defendant's use of
the mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.� <i>Dep't of Parks &amp;
Recreation v. Bazaar Del Mundo Inc.,</i> 448 F.3d 1118, 1124 (9th Cir.2006).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Network does not contest the ownership or its use
of the mark. We note that the district court correctly found the prerequisite
�use in commerce� in Network's use of the mark to purchase keywords to
advertise its products for sale on the Internet. Previously we have assumed,
without expressly deciding, that the use of a trademark as a search engine
keyword that triggers the display of a competitor's advertisement is a �use in
commerce� under the Lanham Act. <i>See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Netscape
Commc'ns Corp.,</i> 354 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Brookfield,</i> 174
F.3d at 1053; <i>see also Finance Express LLC v. Nowcom Corp.,</i> 564
F.Supp.2d 1160, 1172&#8211;73 (C.D.Cal.2008). We now agree with the Second
Circuit that such use is a �use in commerce� under the Lanham Act. <i>See
Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.,</i> 562 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir.2009) (holding that
Google's sale of trademarks as search engine keywords is a use in commerce); <i>see
also</i> J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on Trademarks &amp; Unfair Competition</i>
�� 23:11.50, 25:70:25 (4th ed. 2010) (suggesting that cases taking a more
restrictive view of �use� in this context are based on an erroneous
interpretation of the Lanham Act).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case, therefore, turns on whether Network's
use of Systems' trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion. Network argues
that its use of Systems' mark is legitimate �comparative, contextual
advertising� which presents sophisticated consumers with clear choices. Systems
characterizes Network's behavior differently, accusing it of misleading
consumers by hijacking their attention with intentionally unclear
advertisements. To resolve this dispute we must apply the <i>Sleekcraft</i>
test in a flexible manner, keeping in mind that the eight factors it recited
are not exhaustive, and that only some of them are relevant to determining
whether confusion is likely in the case at hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Sleekcraft,</i> we analyzed the likelihood of
consumer source confusion between boats that were sold under the marks
�Sleekcraft� and �Slickcraft.� We noted that �[w]hen the goods produced by the
alleged infringer compete for sales with those of the trademark owner,
infringement usually will be found if the marks are sufficiently similar that
confusion can be expected.� 599 F.2d at 348. Although both boats were designed
for towing water skiers, and despite a potential overlap in the markets, we
concluded that because �Slickcraft� boats appealed to consumers desiring family
recreation and �Sleekcraft� boats appealed to the �highly skilled enthusiast�
requiring Sleekcraft's higher speeds, the owners were not direct competitors. <i>Id.</i>
Because the goods were not competitive, but merely related, factors in addition
to the similarity of the marks were �added to the calculus.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We identified eight �relevant� factors for
determining whether consumers would likely be confused by related goods: �[1]
strength of the mark; [2] proximity of the goods; [3] similarity of the marks;
[4] evidence of actual confusion; [5] marketing channels used; [6] type of
goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser; [7]
defendant's intent in selecting the mark; and [8] likelihood of expansion of
the product lines.� <i>Id.</i> at 348&#8211;49. We also noted that �the list is
not exhaustive,� and that �[o]ther variables may come into play depending on
the particular facts presented.� <i>Id.</i> at 348 n. 11.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors are intended as an
adaptable proxy for consumer confusion, not a rote checklist. <i>See, e.g.,
Fortune Dynamic, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores Brand Mgmt., Inc.,</i> 618
F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir.2010) (�This eight-factor analysis is �pliant,�
illustrative rather than exhaustive, and best understood as simply providing
helpful guideposts.�); <i>Dreamwerks Prod. Grp., Inc. v. SKG Studio,</i> 142
F.3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir.1998) (�The factors should not be rigidly weighed; we
do not count beans.�); <i>Eclipse Assoc. Ltd. v. Data Gen. Corp.,</i> 894 F.2d 1114,
1118 (9th Cir.1990) (�These tests were not meant to be requirements or hoops
that a district court need jump through to make the determination.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When we first confronted issues of trademark
infringement and consumer confusion in the Internet context over a decade ago
in <i>Brookfield,</i> we noted that �[w]e must be acutely aware of excessive
rigidity when applying the law in the Internet context; emerging technologies
require a flexible approach.� 174 F.3d at 1054. There, Brookfield, a software
company, marketed an entertainment database program under the mark MovieBuff.
It sold the software, and offered access to the database, on its website,
moviebuffonline.com. <i>Id.</i> at 1041&#8211;42. West Coast, a video retailer,
had registered the mark The Movie Buff's Movie Store. West Coast operated a
website using the domain name moviebuff.com, which included a film database
that competed with Brookfield's product. <i>Id.</i> at 1043.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We held that Brookfield was likely to succeed in
its claim to be the senior user of MovieBuff, and that there was a likelihood
of source confusion stemming from West Coast's use of the mark in its domain
name. <i>Id.</i> at 1053, 1060. �Heeding our repeated warnings against simply
launching into a mechanical application of the eight-factor <i>Sleekcraft</i>
test,� we determined that three of the eight factors were the most important in
analyzing source confusion in the context of Internet domain names: (1) the
similarity of the marks; (2) the relatedness of the goods and services offered;
and (3) the simultaneous use of the Internet as a marketing channel. <i>Id.</i>
at 1054 n. 16. Reasoning that the two marks were virtually identical in terms
of sight, sound and meaning, <i>id.</i> at 1055, that West Coast and Brookfield
both offered products and services relating to movies, <i>id.</i> at 1056, and
that they both used the Web as a marketing and advertising device, <i>id.</i>
at 1057, we concluded that consumer confusion was likely, particularly given
the nature of the consumers at issue, who included casual movie watchers
unlikely to realize that they had mistakenly clicked on to West Coast's site
when they had intended to reach Brookfield's, <i>id.</i> at 1060.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Brookfield also asserted that West Coast infringed
its mark by causing initial interest confusion because it had included
MovieBuff in its �metatags,� code not visible to web users embedded in a
website to attract search engines seeking a corresponding keyword.<a
href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[47]</span></span></span></a> <i>Id.</i> at 1061 n. 23.
Although were we to apply the same analysis in the metatags context as we did
in the domain name context, we would easily reach the same conclusion as to
each of the factors (with the possible exception of purchaser care), we
declined to do so, reasoning that the �question in the metatags context is
quite different.� <i>Id.</i> at 1062. In the metatags context, the question was
whether West Coast could use the mark MovieBuff in the metatags of its website
to attract search engines to locate its site when the keyword �MovieBuff� was
entered, a question analogous to the issue presented here. As in the domain
name context, the degree of care and sophistication of the consumer was a key
factor, although the outcome differed. We did not find a likelihood of source
confusion because the results list from a search for �MovieBuff� would result
in a list that included both Brookfield's and West Coast's websites, and if the
consumer clicked on West Coast's site its own name was �prominently
display[ed].� <i>Id.</i> Thus a consumer was much less likely to be confused
about which site he was viewing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finding no source confusion, we nonetheless
concluded that West Coast's use of MovieBuff in its metatags was likely to
cause initial interest confusion. That is, by using Brookfield's mark MovieBuff
to direct persons searching for Brookfield's product to the West Coast site,
West Coast derived an improper benefit from the goodwill Brookfield developed
in its mark. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Five years later in <i>Playboy,</i> we considered
the practice of �keying�&#8212;another situation analogous to that here.
Netscape operated a search engine that offered an early version of a keyword
advertising program. It sold lists of terms to sponsors, and when users
searched for the keywords on the list, the sponsor's advertisement would be
displayed on the results page. 354 F.3d at 1022. Netscape required its advertisers
from the adult entertainment industry to link their ads to one such list that
contained more than 400 terms, including trademarks held by Playboy. <i>Id.</i>
at 1023. Playboy sued, contending that this practice infringed its trademarks
in violation of the Lanham Act. The district court entered summary judgment in
favor of Netscape. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We reversed, holding that summary judgment was
inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether
Netscape's keying practices constituted actionable infringement. <i>Id.</i> at
1031. Following <i>Brookfield,</i> we analyzed the keying issue in terms of
initial interest confusion, �find[ing] insufficient evidence to defeat summary
judgment on any other theory.� <i>Id.</i> at 1024 n. 13. Playboy claimed that
Netscape �misappropriated the goodwill of [its] marks by leading Internet users
to competitors' websites just as West Coast ... misappropriated the goodwill of
Brookfield's mark.� <i>Id.</i> at 1025. In framing the initial interest
confusion inquiry, we stressed that Playboy's infringement claim relied on the
fact that the linked banner advertisements were �unlabeled,� and were,
therefore, more likely to mislead consumers into believing they had followed a
link to Playboy's own website. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Playboy,</i> as in <i>Brookfield,</i> we
applied the <i>Sleekcraft</i> test flexibly, determining that evidence of
actual confusion was the most important factor. <i>Id.</i> at 1026. Playboy had
introduced an expert study showing that a �statistically significant number� of
Internet users searching for the terms �playboy� and �playmate� would think
that Playboy itself sponsored the banner advertisements which appeared on the
search results page. <i>Id.</i> We noted that this study �alone probably
suffices to reverse the grant of summary judgment,� but we nonetheless analyzed
other relevant <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors. <i>Id.</i> As to the strength of the
mark, we credited Playboy's expert reports showing it had created strong
secondary meanings for �playboy� and �playmate.� This suggested that consumers
who entered these terms were likely searching for Playboy's products in
particular. <i>Id.</i> at 1028. Analyzing the nature of the goods and consumer,
we �presume[d] that the average searcher seeking adult-oriented materials on
the Internet is easily diverted from a specific product he or she is seeking if
other options, particularly graphic ones, appear more quickly.� <i>Id.</i> at
1028. We concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact with respect
to whether consumers were likely to be confused by Netscape's keying practices.
<i>Id.</i> at 1031.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Concurring, Judge Berzon was struck by how
analytically similar the keyed advertisements in <i>Playboy</i> were to the
infringing metatags in <i>Brookfield.</i> We agree, and also find similarity to
the use of the keyword �ActiveBatch� in this case. Judge Berzon cautioned that
a broad reading of <i>Brookfield</i> 's metatags holding could result in a
finding of initial interest confusion �when a consumer is never confused as to
source or affiliation, but instead knows, or should know, from the outset that
a product or web link is not related to that of the trademark holder because
the list produced by the search engine so informs him.� <i>Id.</i> at
1034&#8211;35 (Berzon, J., concurring). She clarified that the <i>Playboy</i>
panel's holding was limited to �situations in which the banner advertisements
are not labeled or identified.� <i>Id.</i> at 1036.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judge Berzon analogized the experience of browsing clearly
labeled keyword advertisements to shopping at Macy's, explaining that if a
shopper en route to the Calvin Klein section is diverted by a prominently
displayed Charter Club (Macy's own brand) collection and never reaches the
Calvin Klein collection, it could not be said that Macy's had infringed on
Calvin Klein's trademark by diverting the customer to it with a clearly
labeled, but more prominent display. <i>Id.</i> at 1035. Therefore, it would be
wrong to expand the initial interest confusion theory of infringement beyond
the realm of the misleading and deceptive to the context of legitimate comparative
and contextual advertising.</p>

<p class=Centered>B.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here we consider whether the use of another's
trademark as a search engine keyword to trigger one's own product advertisement
violates the Lanham Act. We begin by examining the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors
that are most relevant to the determination whether the use is likely to cause
initial interest confusion.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[48]</span></span></span></a>
While the district court analyzed each of the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors, it
identified the three most important factors as (1) the similarity of the marks,
(2) the relatedness of the goods or services, and (3) the simultaneous use of
the Web as a marketing channel, for any case addressing trademark infringement
on the Internet. For this proposition the district court cited <i>GoTo.com,
Inc. v. Walt Disney Co.,</i> 202 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir.2000), which followed <i>Brookfield</i>
in emphasizing these three factors. <i>See GoTo.com,</i> 202 F.3d at 1205; <i>Brookfield,</i>
174 F.3d at 1054 n. 16.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, we did not intend <i>Brookfield</i> to be
read so expansively as to forever enshrine these three factors&#8212;now often
referred to as the �Internet trinity� or �Internet troika�&#8212;as the test
for trademark infringement on the Internet. <i>Brookfield</i> was the first to
present a claim of initial interest confusion on the Internet; we recognized at
the time it would not be the last, and so emphasized flexibility over rigidity.
Depending on the facts of each specific case arising on the Internet, other
factors may emerge as more illuminating on the question of consumer confusion.
In <i>Brookfield,</i> we used the �troika� factors to analyze the risk of
source confusion generated by similar domain names, but we did not wholesale
adopt them in the metatag analysis. 174 F.3d at 1054&#8211;55. Subsequent
courts similarly have found the �troika� helpful to resolve disputes involving
websites with similar names or appearances. <i>See, e.g., Internet Specialties
West, Inc. v. Milon&#8211;DiGiorgio Enters., Inc.,</i> 559 F.3d 985,
988&#8211;89 (9th Cir.2009); <i>Perfumebay.com Inc. v. eBay, Inc.,</i> 506 F.3d
1165, 1169, 1173 (9th Cir.2007); <i>Interstellar Starship Servs., Ltd. v. Epix,
Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 936, 939, 942 (9th Cir.2002); <i>GoTo.com,</i> 202 F.3d at
1203&#8211;05. The leading trademark treatise correctly explains that the
�troika� analysis �is appropriate for domain name disputes.� McCarthy at �
24:39.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Given the multifaceted nature of the Internet and
the ever-expanding ways in which we all use the technology, however, it makes
no sense to prioritize the same three factors for every type of potential
online commercial activity. The �troika� is a particularly poor fit for the
question presented here. <i>See</i> Jonathan Moskin, <i>Virtual Trademark
Use&#8212;The Parallel World of Keyword Ads,</i> 98 Trademark Reporter 873,
892&#8211;93 (2008) (arguing that the �troika� is inadequate for analyzing
trademark infringement claims based on search engine keyword advertising
because it omits important factors). The potential infringement in this context
arises from the risk that while using Systems' mark to search for information
about its product, a consumer might be confused by a results page that shows a
competitor's advertisement on the same screen, when that advertisement does not
clearly identify the source or its product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In determining the proper inquiry for this
particular trademark infringement claim, we adhere to two long stated
principles: the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors (1) are non-exhaustive, and (2)
should be applied flexibly, particularly in the context of Internet commerce.
Finally, because the <i>sine qua non</i> of trademark infringement is consumer
confusion, when we examine initial interest confusion, the owner of the mark
must demonstrate likely confusion, not mere diversion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We turn to an examination of each <i>Sleekcraft</i>
factor to analyze whether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion in this
case, assigning each factor appropriate weight in accordance with its relevance
to the factual circumstances presented here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>1. Strength of the Mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> �The
stronger a mark&#8212;meaning the more likely it is to be remembered and associated
in the public mind with the mark's owner&#8212;the greater the protection it is
accorded by the trademark laws.� <i>Brookfield,</i> 174 F.3d at 1058. Two
relevant measurements are conceptual strength and commercial strength.
Conceptual strength involves classification of a mark �along a spectrum of
generally increasing inherent distinctiveness as generic, descriptive, suggestive,
arbitrary, or fanciful.� <i>Id.</i> �A mark's conceptual strength depends
largely on the obviousness of its connection to the good or service to which it
refers.� <i>Fortune Dynamic,</i> 618 F.3d at 1032&#8211;33. Federal trademark
�[r]egistration alone may be sufficient in an appropriate case to satisfy a
determination of distinctiveness.� <i>Lahoti v. VeriCheck, Inc.,</i> 586 F.3d
1190, 1199 (9th Cir.2009). However, �while the registration adds something on
the scales, we must come to grips with an assessment of the mark itself.� <i>Zobmondo
Entertainment, LLC v. Falls Media, LLC,</i> 602 F.3d 1108, 1115 (9th Cir.2010).
Commercial strength is based on �actual marketplace recognition,� and thus
�advertising expenditures can transform a suggestive mark into a strong mark.� <i>Brookfield,</i>
174 F.3d at 1058.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This factor is probative of confusion here because
a consumer searching for a generic term is more likely to be searching for a
product category. <i>See id.</i> at 1058 n. 19 (�Generic terms are those used
by the public to refer generally to the product rather than a particular brand
of the product.�). That consumer is more likely to expect to encounter links
and advertisements from a variety of sources. By contrast, a user searching for
a distinctive term is more likely to be looking for a particular product, and
therefore could be more susceptible to confusion when sponsored links appear
that advertise a similar product from a different source. <i>See 1&#8211;800
Contacts, Inc. v. Lens.com, Inc.,</i> 755 F.Supp.2d 1151, 2010 WL 5150800 at
*17 (D.Utah 2010) (determining that �1800 Contacts� was a weak mark in a
keyword advertising case because the �nature of how third parties use generic
and descriptive words on search engines� suggested that users who entered the
term were likely searching for a type of product). On the other hand, if the
ordinary consumers of this particular product are particularly sophisticated
and knowledgeable, they might also be aware that Systems is the source of
ActiveBatch software and not be confused at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court acknowledged that the parties
failed to address the strength of the mark, but it concluded that the factor
favors Systems. It reasoned that ActiveBatch is a suggestive mark because it
�requires a mental leap from the mark to the product,� (quoting <i>Brookfield,</i>
174 F.3d at 1058), and as a registered trademark it is �inherently
distinctive.� We agree. Because the mark is both Systems' product name and a
suggestive federally registered trademark, consumers searching for the term are
presumably looking for its specific product, and not a category of goods. Nonetheless,
that may not be the end of the inquiry about this factor, as the sophistication
of the consumers of the product may also play a role. The district court
properly declined to consider commercial strength, which, as an
evidence-intensive inquiry, is unnecessary at the preliminary injunction stage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>2. Proximity of the Goods</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;�Related goods are generally more likely than
unrelated goods to confuse the public as to the producers of the goods.� <i>Brookfield,</i>
174 F.3d at 1055. �[T]he danger presented is that the public will mistakenly assume
there is an association between the producers of the related goods, though no
such association exists.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d at 350. The proximity of
goods is measured by whether the products are: (1) complementary; (2) sold to
the same class of purchasers; and (3) similar in use and function. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The proximity of the goods was relevant in <i>Playboy,</i>
where unsophisticated consumers were confronted with unlabeled banner
advertisements that touted adult-oriented material very similar to Playboy's
own products. There, we concluded that under the circumstances, the relatedness
of the goods bolstered the likelihood of confusion, and therefore favored
Playboy. <i>Playboy,</i> 354 F.3d at 1028. However, the proximity of the goods
would become less important if advertisements are clearly labeled or consumers
exercise a high degree of care, because rather than being misled, the consumer
would merely be confronted with choices among similar products. <i>Id.</i> at
1035 (Berzon, J., concurring) (�[S]uch choices do not constitute trademark
infringement off the internet, and I cannot understand why they should on the
internet.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because the products at issue here are virtually
interchangeable, this factor may be helpful, but it must be considered in
conjunction with the labeling and appearance of the advertisements and the
degree of care exercised by the consumers of the ActiveBatch software. By
weighing this factor in isolation and failing to consider whether the parties'
status as direct competitors would actually lead to a likelihood of confusion,
the district court allowed this factor to weigh too heavily in the analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>3. Similarity of the Marks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> �[T]he
more similar the marks in terms of appearance, sound, and meaning, the greater
the likelihood of confusion.� <i>Brookfield,</i> 174 F.3d at 1054. �Where the
two marks are entirely dissimilar, there is no likelihood of confusion.� <i>Id.</i>
�Similarity of the marks is tested on three levels: sight, sound, and meaning.
Each must be considered as they are encountered in the marketplace.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i>
599 F.2d at 351 (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Sleekcraft,</i> we concluded that the marks
�Sleekcraft� and �Slickcraft� were similar in terms of sight, sound, and
meaning by examining the actual situations in which consumers were likely to
read, hear, and consider the meaning of the terms. <i>Id.</i> at 351&#8211;52.
Such an inquiry is impossible here where the consumer does not confront two
distinct trademarks. Rather, after entering one company's mark as a search
term, the consumer sees a competitor's sponsored link that displays neither
company's trademarks. The district court erroneously treated �ActiveBatch,� the
keyword purchased by Network, as conceptually separate from ActiveBatch the
trademark owned by Systems. This is an artificial distinction that does not
reflect what consumers �encountered in the marketplace.� Again, however,
because the consumer keys in Systems' trademark, which results in Network's
sponsored link, depending on the labeling and appearance of the advertisement,
including whether it identifies Network's own mark, and the degree of care and
sophistication of the consumer, it could be helpful in determining initial
interest confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>4. Evidence of Actual Confusion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;�[A] showing of actual confusion among
significant numbers of consumers provides strong support for the likelihood of
confusion.� <i>Playboy,</i> 354 F.3d at 1026 (citing <i>Thane Int'l, Inc. v.
Trek Bicycle Corp.,</i> 305 F.3d 894, 902 (9th Cir.2002)) (�Evidence of actual
confusion constitutes persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.... If
enough people have been <i>actually</i> confused, then a <i>likelihood</i> that
people are confused is established.�). However, �actual confusion is not
necessary to a finding of likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act.� <i>Academy
of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences v. Creative House Promotions, Inc.,</i>
944 F.2d 1446, 1456 (9th Cir.1991) (citing <i>American Int'l Group, Inc. v.
American Int'l Bank,</i> 926 F.2d 829, 832 (9th Cir.1991)). Indeed, �[p]roving
actual confusion is difficult ... and the courts have often discounted such
evidence because it was unclear or insubstantial.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d
at 352.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Playboy,</i> the expert report showing a
significant number of users were confused by the keying practice at issue was
strong evidence that Playboy's infringement claim should be allowed to proceed.
354 F.3d at 1027. <i>Playboy,</i> however, was decided at the summary judgment
stage, whereas here we examine a sparse record supporting preliminary
injunctive relief. As the district court noted, neither Network nor Systems
provided evidence regarding actual confusion, which is not surprising given the
procedural posture. Therefore, while this is a relevant factor for determining
the likelihood of confusion in keyword advertising cases, its importance is
diminished at the preliminary injunction stage of the proceedings. The district
court correctly concluded that this factor should be accorded no weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>5. Marketing Channels</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �Convergent marketing channels increase the
likelihood of confusion.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d at 353. In <i>Sleekcraft,</i>
the two products were sold in niche marketplaces, including boat shows,
specialty retail outlets, and trade magazines. <i>Id.</i> at 353. However, this
factor becomes less important when the marketing channel is less obscure.
Today, it would be the rare commercial retailer that did not advertise online,
and the shared use of a ubiquitous marketing channel does not shed much light
on the likelihood of consumer confusion. <i>See Playboy,</i> 354 F.3d at 1028
(�Given the broad use of the Internet today, the same could be said for
countless companies. Thus, this factor merits little weight.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, the district court's determination that
because both parties advertise on the Internet this factor weighed in favor of
Systems was incorrect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>6. Type of Goods and Degree of Care</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> &nbsp;�Low consumer care ... increases the
likelihood of confusion.� <i>Playboy,</i> 354 F.3d at 1028. �In assessing the
likelihood of confusion to the public, the standard used by the courts is the
typical buyer exercising ordinary caution.... When the buyer has expertise in
the field, a higher standard is proper though it will not preclude a finding
that confusion is likely. Similarly, when the goods are expensive, the buyer
can be expected to exercise greater care in his purchases; again, though,
confusion may still be likely.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d at 353 (citations
omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The nature of the goods and the type of consumer is
highly relevant to determining the likelihood of confusion in the keyword
advertising context. A sophisticated consumer of business software exercising a
high degree of care is more likely to understand the mechanics of Internet
search engines and the nature of sponsored links, whereas an un-savvy consumer
exercising less care is more likely to be confused. The district court
determined that this factor weighed in Systems' favor because �there is
generally a low degree of care exercised by Internet consumers.� However, the
degree of care analysis cannot begin and end at the marketing channel. We still
must consider the nature and cost of the goods, and whether �the products being
sold are marketed primarily to expert buyers.� <i>Brookfield,</i> 174 F.3d at
1060.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Brookfield,</i> the websites were visited by
both sophisticated entertainment industry professionals and amateur film fans,
which supported the conclusion that at least some of the consumers were likely
to exercise a low degree of care. <i>Id.</i> at 1056. In <i>Playboy,</i> the
relevant consumer was looking for cheap, interchangeable adult-oriented
material, which similarly led to our court's finding that the consumers at
issue would exercise a low degree of care. 354 F.3d at 1029. In both cases, we
looked beyond the medium itself and to the nature of the particular goods and
the relevant consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have recently acknowledged that the default
degree of consumer care is becoming more heightened as the novelty of the
Internet evaporates and online commerce becomes commonplace. In <i>Toyota Motor
Sales v. Tabari,</i> 610 F.3d 1171 (9th Cir.2010), we vacated a preliminary
injunction that prohibited a pair of automobile brokers from using Toyota's
�Lexus� mark in their domain names.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[49]</span></span></span></a>
We determined that it was unlikely that a reasonably prudent consumer would be
confused into believing that a domain name that included a product name would
necessarily have a formal affiliation with the maker of the product, as
�[c]onsumers who use the internet for shopping are generally quite
sophisticated about such matters.� <i>Id.</i> at 1178. The <i>Tabari</i> panel
reasoned,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[I]n the age of FIOS, cable modems, DSL and T1 lines,
reasonable, prudent and experienced internet consumers are accustomed to such
exploration by trial and error. They skip from site to site, ready to hit the
back button whenever they're not satisfied with a site's contents. They fully
expect to find some sites that aren't what they imagine based on a glance at the
domain name or search engine summary. Outside the special case of ... domains
that actively claim affiliation with the trademark holder, consumers don't form
any firm expectations about the sponsorship of a website until they've seen the
landing page&#8212;if then.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 1179 (citations omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We further explained that we expect consumers
searching for expensive products online to be even more sophisticated. <i>Id.</i>
at 1176 (�Unreasonable, imprudent and inexperienced web-shoppers are not
relevant.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore the district court improperly concluded
that this factor weighed in Systems' favor based on a conclusion reached by our
court more than a decade ago in <i>Brookfield</i> and <i>GoTo.com</i> that
Internet users on the whole exercise a low degree of care. While the statement
may have been accurate then, we suspect that there are many contexts in which
it no longer holds true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>7. Defendant's Intent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> �When
the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another's, reviewing
courts presume that the defendant can accomplish his purpose: that is, that the
public will be deceived.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d at 354. Nevertheless, we
have also �recognized that liability for infringement may not be imposed for
using a registered trademark in connection with truthful comparative
advertising.� <i>Lindy Pen Co., Inc. v. Bic Pen Corp.,</i> 725 F.2d 1240, 1248
(9th Cir.1984).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, much like the proximity of the goods,
the defendant's intent may be relevant here, but only insofar as it bolsters a
finding that the use of the trademark serves to mislead consumers rather than
truthfully inform them of their choice of products. The district court
incorrectly considered the intent factor in isolation, and concluded that it
weighed in Systems' favor without first determining that Network intended to deceive
consumers rather than compare its product to ActiveBatch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>8. Likelihood of Expansion of the Product Lines</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;<span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> �Inasmuch
as a trademark owner is afforded greater protection against competing goods, a
�strong possibility� that either party may expand his business to compete with
the other will weigh in favor of finding that the present use is infringing.
When goods are closely related, any expansion is likely to result in direct competition.�
<i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d at 354 (citations omitted). Where two companies are
direct competitors, this factor is unimportant. <i>Cf. Brookfield,</i> 174 F.3d
at 1060. Therefore, the district court correctly declined to consider the
likelihood of expansion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>9. Other Relevant Factors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The eight <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors are �not
exhaustive. Other variables may come into play depending on the particular
facts presented.� <i>Sleekcraft,</i> 599 F.2d at 348 n. 11. In the keyword advertising

saw on the screen and reasonably believed, given the context.� <i>Hearts on

it important that the consumers saw banner advertisements that were

clear labeling �might eliminate the likelihood of initial interest confusion

surrounding context on the user's screen are similarly important here. The
district court correctly examined the text of Network's sponsored links,
concluding that the advertisements did not clearly identify their source.
However, the district court did not consider the surrounding context. In <i>Playboy,</i>
we also found it important that Netscape's search engine did not clearly
segregate the sponsored advertisements from the objective results. 354 F.3d at
1030. Here, even if Network has not clearly identified itself in the text of
its ads, Google and Bing have partitioned their search results pages so that
the advertisements appear in separately labeled sections for �sponsored� links.
The labeling and appearance of the advertisements as they appear on the results
page includes more than the text of the advertisement, and must be considered
as a whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Given the nature of the alleged infringement here,
the most relevant factors to the analysis of the likelihood of confusion are:
(1) the strength of the mark; (2) the evidence of actual confusion; (3) the
type of goods and degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser; and
(4) the labeling and appearance of the advertisements and the surrounding
context on the screen displaying the results page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span

factors flexibly to match the specific facts of this case. It relied on the
Internet �troika,� which is highly illuminating in the context of domain names,
but which fails to discern whether there is a likelihood of confusion in a keywords
case. Because the linchpin of trademark infringement is consumer confusion, the
district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction. <i>See United
States v. Hinkson,</i> 585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (holding
that a district court abuses its discretion by failing to identify the correct
legal rule to apply); <i>see also Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Moose Creek,

abused its discretion in its application of the <i>Sleekcraft</i> factors). We
need not reach the three remaining preliminary injunction elements, or consider
the remaining issues on appeal. <i>See Advertise.com, Inc. v. AOL Advertising,

<p class=Centered><b>Questions and Comments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp; <i>Initial Interest Confusion and Trade Dress</i>.&nbsp;
In <i>Gibson Guitar Corp. v. Paul Reed Smith Guitars, LP</i>, 423 F.3d 539 (6th
Cir. 2005), Gibson and Paul Reed Smith both manufactured single cutaway
guitars, the shape of which is shown below in&nbsp; Gibson�s trademark
registration for its product configuration. &nbsp;Gibson conceded that there
was no likelihood of point-of-sale confusion due to Paul Reed Smith�s prominent
labelling, but argued that there was a likelihood of initial interest confusion
in that consumers would see a PRS single cutaway guitar from across a store and
believe it to be a Gibson guitar.&nbsp; The Sixth Circuit declined to apply
initial interest confusion to trade dress.&nbsp; It reasoned: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The potential ramifications of applying this judicially
created doctrine to product-shape trademarks are different from the
ramifications of applying the doctrine to trademarks on a product's name, a
company's name, or a company's logo. <i>Cf. Versa Prods. Co. v. Bifold Co</i>.,
50 F.3d 189, 201&#8211;03, 207, 209, 212&#8211;13, 215 (3rd Cir.1995)
(discussing the related context of product-configuration trade dress).
Specifically, there are only a limited number of shapes in which many products
can be made. A product may have a shape which is neither functional nor generic
(and hence which can be trademarked) but nonetheless is still likely to
resemble a competing product when viewed from the far end of a store aisle.
Thus, many legitimately competing product shapes are likely to create some
initial interest in the competing product due to the competing product's
resemblance to the better-known product when viewed from afar. In other words,
application of the initial-interest-confusion doctrine to product shapes would
allow trademark holders to protect not only the actual product shapes they have
trademarked, but also a �penumbra� of more or less similar shapes that would
not otherwise qualify for trademark protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(In ruling in favor of Paul Reed Smith on all surviving
claims brought against it, the court ruled that Paul Reed Smith�s functionality
objection to the validity of Gibson�s mark was moot).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp; <i>Critiquing Initial Interest Confusion</i>.&nbsp;
For a thorough critique of current initial interest confusion doctrine, see
Jennifer E. Rothman, <i>Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads
of Trademark Law</i>, 27 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Cardozo L. Rev</span>.
105 (2005).&nbsp; Rothman observes: �The courts' <span class=cosearchterm>initial</span>
motivation for adopting <span class=cosearchterm>initial</span> <span
class=cosearchterm>interest</span> <span class=cosearchterm>confusion</span>
was a legitimate effort to prevent baiting and switching practices. However,
since then courts have unreasonably stretched the doctrine to cover many
circumstances which should be considered fair competition or which are better
addressed by other existing statutes.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 113.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392164821"><a name="_Toc388442221"><a name="_Toc369029427">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-Sale
Confusion</a></a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While initial interest confusion addresses the likelihood of
confusion before the point of sale, post-sale confusion, as its name suggests,
addresses confusion after the point of sale.&nbsp; One of the first cases the
recognize some form of post-sale confusion was <i>Mastercrafters Clock &amp;
Radio Co. v. Vacheron &amp; Constantin-LeCoultre Watches, Inc</i>., 221 F.2d
464 (2d Cir. 1955). In <i>Mastercrafters</i>, the declaratory plaintiff
Mastercrafters produced an electric clock made to look like the declaratory
defendant�s prestigious and expensive Atmos table clock, a non-electric clock
that wound itself from changes in atmospheric pressure.&nbsp; Mastercrafters
sold its clock for about $30; Vacheron sold the Atmos clock for not less than
$175 (about $1,500 in today�s money).&nbsp; Mastercrafters sought a declaration
that its conduct did not constitute unfair competition.&nbsp; Judge Frank held
in favor of Vacheron.&nbsp; Though there was no point-of-sale confusion, there
was nevertheless unfair competition:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>True, a customer examining plaintiff's clock would see from
the electric cord, that it was not an �atmospheric� clock. But, as the
[district] judge found, plaintiff copied the design of the Atmos clock because
plaintiff intended to, and did, attract purchasers who wanted a �luxury design�
clock. This goes to show at least that some customers would buy plaintiff's
cheaper clock for the purpose of acquiring the prestige gained by displaying
what many visitors at the customers' homes would regard as a prestigious
article. Plaintiff's wrong thus consisted of the fact that such a visitor would
be likely to assume that the clock was an Atmos clock. Neither the electric
cord attached to, nor the plaintiff's name on, its clock would be likely to come
to the attention of such a visitor; the likelihood of such confusion suffices
to render plaintiff's conduct actionable.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 464.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The post-sale confusion theory has been controversial, as
the dissent in the following case suggests.&nbsp; In reading through <i>Ferrari
S.P.A. v. Roberts</i>, 944 F.2d 1235 (6th Cir. 1991), which involves the
unauthorized production of �Faurarris�, consider the following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Should courts take into account the confusion as to source of
consumers who would never actually purchase the plaintiff�s goods (or the
defendant�s goods for that matter)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Should trademark law be used to protect status goods?&nbsp; If
not, is it possible to design trademark law in such a way that it will not
protect status goods?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This is a trademark infringement action brought
pursuant to the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1051, <i>et seq.</i> The principal
issue is whether the district court correctly concluded that plaintiff Ferrari
enjoyed unregistered trademark protection in the exterior shape and appearance
of two of its automobiles and, if so, whether defendant Roberts' replicas of
Ferrari's designs infringed that protection, in violation of section 43(a) of
the Lanham Act�. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We hold that the district court properly decided
all of the issues and, therefore, we shall affirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I.</p>

<p class=Centered>The Facts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ferrari is the world famous designer and
manufacturer of racing automobiles and upscale sports cars. Between 1969 and
1973, Ferrari produced the 365 GTB/4 Daytona. Because Ferrari intentionally
limits production of its cars in order to create an image of exclusivity, only
1400 Daytonas were built; of these, only 100 were originally built as Spyders,
soft-top convertibles. Daytona Spyders currently sell for one to two million
dollars. Although Ferrari no longer makes Daytona Spyders, they have
continuously produced mechanical parts and body panels, and provided repair
service for the cars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ferrari began producing a car called the Testarossa
in 1984. To date, Ferrari has produced approximately 5000 Testarossas.
Production of these cars is also intentionally limited to preserve exclusivity:
the entire anticipated production is sold out for the next several years and
the waiting period to purchase a Testarossa is approximately five years. A new
Testarossa sells for approximately $230,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Roberts is engaged in a number of business ventures
related to the automobile industry. One enterprise is the manufacture of
fiberglass kits that replicate the exterior features of Ferrari's Daytona
Spyder and Testarossa automobiles. Roberts' copies are called the Miami Spyder
and the Miami Coupe, respectively. The kit is a one-piece body shell molded
from reinforced fiberglass. It is usually bolted onto the undercarriage of
another automobile such as a Chevrolet Corvette or a Pontiac Fiero, called the
donor car. Roberts marketed the Miami Spyder primarily through advertising in
kit-car magazines. Most of the replicas were sold as kits for about $8,500,
although a fully accessorized �turnkey� version was available for about
$50,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the time of trial, Roberts had not yet completed
a kit-car version of the Miami Coupe, the replica of Ferrari's Testarossa,
although he already has two orders for them. He originally built the Miami
Coupe for the producers of the television program �Miami Vice� to be used as a
stunt car in place of the more expensive Ferrari Testarossa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court found, and it is not disputed,
that Ferrari's automobiles and Roberts' replicas are virtually identical in
appearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ferrari brought suit against Roberts in March 1988
alleging trademark infringement, in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act, and obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining Roberts from manufacturing
the replica cars. The injunction was later amended to permit Roberts to
recommence production of the two models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Five months later, Roberts filed a voluntary
petition in bankruptcy. Despite the Chapter 11 proceedings, the bankruptcy
court, in a carefully limited order, lifted the automatic stay and permitted
Ferrari to continue to prosecute this action. Prior to trial, the district
court denied Roberts' request for a jury, and the case was tried to the court
resulting in a verdict for Ferrari and a permanent injunction enjoining Roberts
from producing the Miami Spyder and the Miami Coupe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act creates a civil
cause of action for trademark infringement. In relevant part, section 43(a)
provides:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or
services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name,
symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin,
false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation
of fact, which-</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(1) is likely to cause confusion,
or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or
association of such person with another person, or as to the origin,
sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person....</p>

<p class=Blockquote>....</p>

<p class=Blockquote>shall be liable in a civil action by any person who
believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The protection against infringement provided by
section 43(a) is not limited to �goods, services or commercial activities�
protected by registered trademarks. It extends as well, in certain
circumstances, to the unregistered �trade dress� of an article. �Trade dress�
refers to �the image and overall appearance of a product.� <i>Allied Mktg.
Group, Inc. v. CDL Mktg., Inc.,</i> 878 F.2d 806, 812 (5th Cir.1989). It
embodies �that arrangement of identifying characteristics or decorations
connected with a product, whether by packaging or otherwise, intended to make
the source of the product distinguishable from another and to promote its
sale.� <i>Mr. Gasket Co. v. Travis,</i> 35 Ohio App.2d 65, 72 n. 13, 299 N.E.2d
906, 912 n. 13 (1973).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ferrari's Lanham Act claim in this case is a �trade
dress� claim. Ferrari charges, and the district court found, that the unique
and distinctive exterior shape and design of the Daytona Spyder and the
Testarossa are protected trade dress which Roberts has infringed by copying
them and marketing his replicas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Roberts asserts that there has been no infringement
under section 43(a) for a number of reasons: (1) the design of Ferrari's
vehicles are protected only under design patent law, <i>see</i> 35 U.S.C. �
171, and not the Lanham Act; (2) there is no actionable likelihood of confusion
between Ferrari's vehicles and Roberts' replicas at the point of sale; and (3)
the �aesthetic functionality doctrine� precludes recovery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We shall take up each argument in turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To prove a violation of section 43(a), Ferrari's
burden is to show, by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1) that the trade dress of Ferrari's vehicles has acquired a
�secondary meaning,�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2) that there is a likelihood of confusion based on the
similarity of the exterior shape and design of Ferrari's vehicles and Roberts'
replicas, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3) that the appropriated features of Ferrari's trade dress
are primarily nonfunctional.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>See Kwik-Site Corp. v. Clear View Mfg. Co., Inc., 758
F.2d 167, 178 (6th Cir.1985).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>&nbsp;A.</p>

<p class=Centered>&nbsp;Secondary Meaning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To acquire a secondary meaning in the minds of the
buying public, an article of merchandise when shown to a prospective customer
must prompt the affirmation, �That is the article I want because I know its
source,� and not the negative inquiry as to �Who makes that article?� In other
words, the article must proclaim its identification with its source, and not
simply stimulate inquiry about it.&nbsp; <i>West Point Mfg. Co. v. Detroit Stamping
Co.,</i> 222 F.2d 581, 595 (6th Cir.) (citation omitted), <i>cert. denied,</i>
350 U.S. 840 (1955). Arguably, secondary meaning in this case can be presumed
from Roberts' admissions that he intentionally copied Ferrari's designs.
Roberts told Vivian Bumgardner, an investigator who recorded her conversations
with Roberts, that �we put this whole body right on it and it looks just like a
real car, I mean they can't tell by looking.... We build and sell the same car,
reproduce it.� The intent to copy was also shown by Roberts' use of the
distinctive Ferrari prancing horse logo on the front parking lights of the
Daytona Spyder and in advertising brochures. The original Miami Coupe brochure
even copied the Ferrari name by referring to the Roberts' car as the �Miami Testarossa.�
The evidence of intentional copying shows the strong secondary meaning of the
Ferrari designs because �[t]here is no logical reason for the precise copying
save an attempt to realize upon a secondary meaning that is in existence.� <i>Audio
Fidelity, Inc. v. High Fidelity Recordings, Inc.,</i> 283 F.2d 551, 558 (9th
Cir.1960).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ferrari, however, need not rely on a presumption of
secondary meaning because the evidence at trial showed that the exterior design
of Ferrari's vehicles enjoyed strong secondary meaning. Lawrence Crane, Art
Director of <i>Automobile</i> magazine, testified that the shape of a Ferrari
�says Ferrari to the general populous (sic)� and that �because it's so
instantly recognizable ... we've used even just portions of Ferraris, the
Testarossa, for instance, and people recognize it, and our sales are changed.�
William Moore, Editor of <i>Kit Car Illustrated,</i> and a witness for Roberts,
conceded that car replica manufacturers frequently copy Ferraris because the
�special image� associated with Ferrari creates a market for cars which look
like Ferraris. The testimony of Crane and Moore was supported by survey data
which indicated that of survey respondents shown photographs of Ferrari's cars
without identifying badges, 73% properly identified a photograph of Daytona
Spyder as manufactured by Ferrari and 82% identified the Testarossa as a
Ferrari product. Such survey evidence, combined with intentional copying and
the widespread publicity surrounding Ferraris, convinced the court in a
separate action brought by Ferrari against Roberts' former partner to enjoin
him from producing replicas of the Daytona Spyder identical to those produced
by Roberts, that the Ferrari vehicle design has a secondary meaning:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In light of defendants' close intentional copying, their
failure to introduce any evidence to show that such copying was for any purpose
but to associate themselves with the reputation and mark<span
class=BlockquoteChar>e</span>tability of the Ferrari DAYTONA SPYDER, the large
amount of recognition of said design with Ferrari shown in continuous magazine
articles and books about the DAYTONA SPYDER long after the cessation of its
manufacture, the showings of the Ferrari DAYTONA SPYDER at vintage car shows,
the highly publicized sales of said car by Ferrari customers, and the
percentages of recognition in both the plaintiff's and the defendants' surveys,
... the court finds the evidence thorough and convincing that the Ferrari
DAYTONA SPYDER design has achieved a strong secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Ferrari S.P.A. v. McBurnie,</i> 11 U.S.P.Q.2d 1843,
1846-47 (S.D.Cal.1989).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ferrari's vehicles would not acquire secondary
meaning merely because they are unique designs or because they are aesthetically
beautiful. The design must be one that is instantly identified in the mind of
the informed viewer as a Ferrari design. The district court found, and we
agree, that the unique exterior design and shape of the Ferrari vehicles are
their �mark� or �trade dress� which distinguish the vehicles' exterior shapes
not simply as distinctively attractive designs, but as Ferrari creations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We also agree with the district court that Roberts'
admission that he intentionally copied Ferrari's design, the survey evidence
introduced by Ferrari, and the testimony of Crane and Moore amount to abundant
evidence that the exterior design features of the Ferrari vehicles are �trade
dress� which have acquired secondary meaning.</p>

<p class=Centered>District Court's Findings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This court has held that in determining likelihood
of confusion in a Lanham Act case, the court should consider the following
factors: strength of the plaintiff's mark; relatedness of the goods; similarity
of the marks; evidence of actual confusion; marketing channels used; likely
degree of purchaser care; defendant's intent in selecting the mark; and
likelihood of expansion of the product lines. <i>Frisch's Restaurants, Inc. v.
Elby's Big Boy,</i> 670 F.2d 642, 648 (6th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 459 U.S.
916, 103 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982). A party claiming infringement need
not show all, or even most, of these factors in order to prevail. <i>Wynn Oil
Co. v. Thomas,</i> 839 F.2d 1183, 1186 (6th Cir.1988). A district court's
findings regarding each factor are reviewed for clear error, but the further
determination of likelihood of confusion based on those factors is a legal
conclusion reviewed <i>de novo. Frisch's Restaurants,</i> 670 F.2d at 651.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court found, based upon an evaluation
of the eight <i>Frisch</i> factors, that the similarity of the exterior design
of the Ferrari vehicles and the Roberts replicas was likely to confuse the
public. The court noted that while no evidence was offered on two of the
factors, evidence of actual confusion and likelihood of expansion of the
product lines, two others, marketing channels and purchaser care, favored
Roberts and the remaining factors �radically favor[ed] Ferrari.� Summarized,
the district court's findings on the <i>Frisch</i> �likelihood of confusion�
factors are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Recalling that the claimed mark involved here is
the trade dress&#8212;the exterior shape and design of the Ferrari vehicles&#8212;it
is clear that Ferrari's mark is very strong. The strength of the mark is its
distinctiveness and Ferrari's designs are unquestionably distinctive. The
survey evidence we have discussed, as well as the testimony that the shape of
the plaintiff's vehicles �says Ferrari,� is evidence of that distinctiveness.
Indeed, Roberts' purposeful effort to copy the Ferrari designs is strong
circumstantial evidence of the distinctiveness of the originals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There is no dispute about the relatedness of the
goods factor. The products produced by both parties are sports cars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Likewise, the similarity of the marks&#8212;the
exterior designs of the vehicles&#8212;is indisputable. Ferrari offered survey
evidence which showed that 68% of the respondents could not distinguish a
photograph of the McBurnie replica, upon which Roberts' Miami Spyder is based,
from a photograph of the genuine Ferrari Daytona Spyder. In these photographs,
the cars were shown without identifying insignia. Drawings for Roberts' cars
show identifying insignia, an �R� on the parking lens and vent window, but the
cars produced at the time of trial did not include the �R�. Because the survey
respondents saw photographs of the McBurnie cars, and because all of the
identifying insignia were removed, the survey has limited value in showing the
likelihood of confusion between the Roberts and Ferrari vehicles if displayed
with identifying emblems. The survey, however, does show that the trade dress of
the two car designs, the shapes and exteriors, were quite similar. An
examination of the photographs of the cars which are in evidence confirms the
striking similarity of the dress of the originals and the replicas. They are
virtually indistinguishable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, Roberts conceded that his intent in
replicating the exterior design of Ferrari's vehicles was to market a product
that looked as much as possible like a Ferrari original, although Roberts made
no claim to his customers that his replicas were Ferraris. � �[The] intent of
[a party] in adopting [another's mark] is a critical factor, since if the mark
was adopted with the intent of deriving benefit from the reputation of [the
plaintiff,] <i>that fact alone may be sufficient to justify the inference that
there is confusing similarity.</i>� � <i>Frisch's Restaurants,</i> 670 F.2d at
648 (emphasis in original) (quoting <i>Amstar Corp. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc.,</i>
615 F.2d 252, 263 (5th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 268,
66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980)); <i>see also </i>&nbsp;<i>Mastercrafters,</i> 221 F.2d
at 467. This is especially true in cases, such as this one, where the defendant
sold a comparatively cheap imitation of an expensive, exclusive item. As the
court in <i>Rolex Watch</i> explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>By selling the bogus watches, only one inference may be
drawn: the Defendants intended to derive benefit from the Plaintiff's
reputation. This inference is no less reasonable when weighed against the
Defendants' assertion that in selling these watches, they did not fail to
inform the recipients that they were counterfeits.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Rolex Watch, U.S.A., Inc. v. Canner,</i> 645 F.Supp.
484, 492 (S.D.Fla.1986). Intentional copying, however, is not actionable under
the Lanham Act �absent evidence that the copying was done with the intent to
derive a benefit from the reputation of another.� <i>Zin-Plas Corp. v. Plumbing
Quality AGF Co.,</i> 622 F.Supp. 415, 420 (W.D.Mich.1985). �Where the copying
by one party of another's product is not done to deceive purchasers and thus
derive a benefit from another's name and reputation, but rather to avail
oneself of a design which is attractive and desirable, a case of unfair
competition is not made out.� <i>West Point Mfg.,</i> 222 F.2d at 586. In this
case, where Ferrari's design enjoyed strong secondary meaning and Roberts
admitted that he designed his cars to look like Ferrari's, the intent to copy
was clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We conclude that aside from the presumption of
likelihood of confusion that follows from intentional copying, Ferrari produced
strong evidence that the public is likely to be confused by the similarity of
the exterior design of Ferrari's vehicles and Roberts' replicas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Roberts' Objections</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Roberts disagrees with the legal significance of
the district court's findings of likelihood of confusion. He argues that for
purposes of the Lanham Act, the requisite likelihood of confusion must be
confusion at the point of sale&#8212;purchaser confusion&#8212;and not the
confusion of nonpurchasing, casual observers. The evidence is clear that
Roberts assured purchasers of his replicas that they were not purchasing
Ferraris and that his customers were not confused about what they were buying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=Centered>b.</p>

<p class=Centered>Confusion at Point of Sale</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Roberts argues that his replicas do not violate the
Lanham Act because he informed his purchasers that his significantly cheaper
cars and kits were not genuine Ferraris and thus there was no confusion at the
point of sale. The Lanham Act, however, was intended to do more than protect
consumers at the point of sale. When the Lanham Act was enacted in 1946, its
protection was limited to the use of marks �likely to cause confusion or
mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or
services.� In 1967, Congress deleted this language and broadened the Act's
protection to include the use of marks �likely to cause confusion or mistake or
to deceive.� Thus, Congress intended �to regulate commerce within [its control]
by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such
commerce; [and] ... to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair
competition....� 15 U.S.C. � 1127. Although, as the dissent points out,
Congress rejected an anti-dilution provision when recently amending the Lanham
Act, it made no effort to amend or delete this language clearly protecting the
confusion of goods <i>in commerce.</i> The court in <i>Rolex Watch</i>
explicitly recognized this concern with regulating commerce:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The real question before this Court is whether the alleged
infringer has placed a product <i>in commerce</i> that is �likely to cause
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.� ... The fact that an immediate
buyer of a $25 counterfeit watch does not entertain any notions that it is the
real thing has no place in this analysis. Once a product is injected into
commerce, there is no bar to confusion, mistake, or deception occurring at some
future point in time.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Rolex Watch,</i> 645 F.Supp. at 492-93 (emphasis in
original). The <i>Rolex Watch</i> court noted that this interpretation was
necessary to protect against the cheapening and dilution of the genuine
product, and to protect the manufacturer's reputation. <i>Id.</i> at 495; <i>see
also Mastercrafters,</i> 221 F.2d at 466. As the court explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Individuals examining the counterfeits, believing them to
be genuine Rolex watches, might find themselves unimpressed with the quality of
the item and consequently be inhibited from purchasing the real time piece.
Others who see the watches bearing the Rolex trademarks on so many wrists might
find themselves discouraged from acquiring a genuine because the items have
become too common place and no longer possess the prestige once associated with
them.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Rolex Watch,</i> 645 F.Supp. at 495; <i>see also
Mastercrafters,</i> 221 F.2d at 466. Such is the damage which could occur here.
As the district court explained when deciding whether Roberts' former partner's
Ferrari replicas would be confused with Ferrari's cars:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Ferrari has gained a well-earned reputation for making
uniquely designed automobiles of quality and rarity. The DAYTONA SPYDER design
is well-known among the relevant public and exclusively and positively
associated with Ferrari. If the country is populated with hundreds, if not
thousands, of replicas of rare, distinct, and unique vintage cars, obviously
they are no longer unique. Even if a person seeing one of these replicas
driving down the road is not confused, Ferrari's exclusive association with
this design has been diluted and eroded. If the replica Daytona looks cheap or
in disrepair, Ferrari's reputation for rarity and quality could be damaged....</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Ferrari,</i> 11 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1848. The dissent
argues that the Lanham Act requires proof of confusion at the point of sale
because the eight factor test used to determine likelihood of confusion focuses
on the confusion of the purchaser, not the public. The dissent submits that
three of the factors, marketing channels used, likely degree of purchaser care
and sophistication, and evidence of actual confusion, specifically relate to
purchasers. However, evidence of actual confusion is not limited to purchasers.
The survey evidence in this case showed that members of the public, but not
necessarily purchasers, were actually confused by the similarity of the
products. Moreover, the other five factors, strength of the mark, relatedness
of the goods, similarity of the marks, defendant's intent in selecting the
mark, and likelihood of product expansion, do not limit the likelihood of
confusion test to purchasers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Since Congress intended to protect the reputation
of the manufacturer as well as to protect purchasers, the Act's protection is
not limited to confusion at the point of sale. Because Ferrari's reputation in
the field could be damaged by the marketing of Roberts' replicas, the district
court did not err in permitting recovery despite the absence of point of sale
confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KENNEDY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> I respectfully dissent because the majority opinion
does more than protect consumers against a likelihood of confusion as to the
source of goods; it protects the source of the goods, Ferrari, against
plaintiff's copying of its design even if the replication is accompanied by
adequate labelling so as to prevent consumer confusion. I believe the majority
commits two errors in reaching this result. The majority first misconstrues the
scope of protection afforded by the Lanham Act by misapplying the �likelihood
of confusion� test and reading an anti-dilution provision into the language of
section 43(a). The majority then affirms an injunction that is overbroad�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>I. Section 43(a) and Trade Dress Protection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority invokes the appropriate test to
determine whether protection is available for an unregistered trademark
pursuant to section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. <i>Kwik-Site Corp. v. Clear View
Mfg. Co.,</i> 758 F.2d 167 (6th Cir.1985) (secondary meaning; likelihood of
confusion; and nonfunctionality of trade dress). While I agree that Ferrari's
designs have acquired secondary meaning and are primarily nonfunctional, I disagree
with the majority's construction and application of the likelihood of confusion
test and their conclusion that the Lanham Act protects against dilution of a
manufacturer's goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This Circuit applies an eight-factor test to
determine whether relevant consumers in the marketplace will confuse one item
with another item. <i>Frisch's Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby's Big Boy, Inc.,</i>
670 F.2d 642 (6th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 459 U.S. 916 (1982). The majority
correctly points out one purpose this test is <i>not</i> designed to
accomplish: �Where the copying by one party of another's product is not done to
<i>deceive purchasers</i> and thus derive a benefit from another's name and
reputation, but rather to avail oneself of a design which is attractive and
desirable, a case of unfair competition is not made out.� <i>West Point Mfg. v.
Detroit Stamping Co.,</i> 222 F.2d 581, 586 (6th Cir.) (emphasis added), <i>cert.
denied,</i> 350 U.S. 840 (1955). This passage properly notes that the statute
is triggered when a copier attempts to �palm off� his replica as an original.
In other words, the protection afforded by the Lanham Act is primarily to
potential purchasers. The protection accruing to a producer is derivative of
and only incidental to this primary protection: a producer can market his goods
with the assurance that another may not market a replica in a manner that will
allow potential purchasers to associate the replica with the producer of the
original. Unfortunately, the majority merely pays lip service to this
fundamental tenet in its application of the eight-factor test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority never clearly defines the target group
that is likely to be confused. Although <i>West Point</i> counsels that
purchasers must be deceived, the majority concludes that the target group is
the �public.� The majority errs to the extent that its analysis shifts from
potential purchasers to the broader more indefinite group of the �public.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The eight-factor test contemplates that the target
group is comprised of potential purchasers. For example, the importance of one
factor-evidence of actual confusion-is determined by the kinds of persons
confused and degree of confusion. �Short-lived confusion or confusion of
individuals casually acquainted with a business is worthy of little weight....�
<i>Homeowners Group, Inc. v. Home Marketing Specialists, Inc.,</i> 931 F.2d
1100, 1110 (6th Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Safeway Discount
Drugs, Inc.,</i> 675 F.2d 1160, 1167 (11th Cir.1982)). Two other factors
obviously refer to potential purchasers: the marketing channels used and the
likely degree of purchaser care and sophistication. Thus, three of the eight
factors expressly focus on the likelihood of confusion as to potential
purchasers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Other courts have made clear that section 43(a) is
concerned with the welfare of potential purchasers in the marketplace. <i>See
Kwik-Site,</i> 758 F.2d at 178 (referring to �intending purchasers� when
discussing likelihood of confusion); <i>see also Coach Leatherware Co. v.
AnnTaylor, Inc.,</i> 933 F.2d 162, 168 (2d Cir.1991) (stating that plaintiff
must prove that �purchasers are likely to confuse the imitating goods with the
originals�); <i>West Point,</i> 222 F.2d at 592 (referring to �purchasers
exercising ordinary care to discover whose products they are buying....�
(quoting <i>Reynolds &amp; Reynolds Co. v. Norick,</i> 114 F.2d 278 (10th Cir.1940))).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Plaintiff's replicas are not likely to confuse
potential purchasers. Plaintiff's vehicles display an �R� on the parking lenses
and vent windows. No symbols or logos affiliated with Ferrari are displayed.
Roberts informs all purchasers that his product is not affiliated with Ferrari.
In light of these distinctions, and the high degree of customer care and
sophistication that normally accompanies such a purchase-defendant's vehicles
at issue sell for a minimum of $230,000, as well as the distinctly different
marketing channels employed by the parties, I find the evidence insufficient to
prove a likelihood of confusion by potential purchasers in the marketplace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To be sure, some courts have expanded the
application of the likelihood of confusion test to include individuals other
than point-of-sale purchasers. These courts have included potential purchasers
who may contemplate a purchase in the future, reasoning that in the pre-sale
context an �observer would identify the [product] with the [original
manufacturer], and the [original manufacturer]'s reputation would suffer damage
if the [product] appeared to be of poor quality.� <i>Polo Fashions, Inc. v.
Craftex, Inc.,</i> 816 F.2d 145, 148 (4th Cir.1987); <i>see Mastercrafters
Clock &amp; Radio Co. v. Vacheron &amp; Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc.,</i>
221 F.2d 464 (2d Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 350 U.S. 832 (1955); <i>Rolex
Watch, U.S.A., Inc. v. Canner,</i> 645 F.Supp. 484 (S.D.Fla.1986).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In applying the test in this manner, these courts
appear to recognize that the deception of a consumer under these circumstances
could dissuade such a consumer from choosing to buy a particular product,
thereby foreclosing the possibility of point-of-sale confusion but nevertheless
injuring the consumer based on this confusion. The injury stems from the
consumer's erroneous conclusion that the �original� product is poor quality
based on his perception of a replica that he thinks is the original. These
cases protect a potential purchaser against confusion as to the source of a
particular product. Hence, even when expanding the scope of this test, these
courts did not lose sight of the focus of section 43(a): the potential
purchaser. The majority applies the likelihood of confusion test in a manner
which departs from this focus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The cases which have expanded the scope of the
target group are distinguishable from the instant case, however. In <i>Rolex,</i>
the counterfeit watches were labelled �ROLEX� on their face. Similarly, the <i>Mastercrafters</i>
court found that the clock was labelled in a manner that was not likely to come
to the attention of an individual. It is also noteworthy that the Second
Circuit has limited <i>Mastercrafters</i> �by pointing out that �[i]n that case
there was abundant evidence of actual confusion, palming off and an intent to
deceive.� � <i>Bose Corp. v. Linear Design Labs, Inc.,</i> 467 F.2d 304, 310 n.
8 (2d Cir.1972) (quoting <i>Norwich Pharmacal Co. v. Sterling Drug, Inc.,</i>
271 F.2d 569 (2d Cir.1959), <i>cert. denied,</i> 362 U.S. 919 (1960)). No
evidence was introduced in the instant case to show actual confusion, palming
off or an intent to deceive and, as previously noted, plaintiff does not use
any name or logo affiliated with Ferrari on its replicas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Further, these cases conclude that the proper
remedy is to require identification of the source of the replica, not prohibit
copying of the product. <i>See West Point,</i> 222 F.2d at 589 (stating that
under such circumstances �the only obligation of the copier is to identify its
product lest the public be mistaken into believing that it was made by the
prior patentee�); <i>see also Coach Leatherware,</i> 933 F.2d at 173 (Winter,
J., dissenting in part) (stating that �[a copier] thus has every right to copy
[a product] so long as consumers know they are buying [the copied product]�).
Accordingly, even if I were to conclude that plaintiff's copies created
confusion in the pre-sale context, I would tailor the remedy to protect only
against such confusion; this would best be accomplished through adequate
labelling. The majority's remedy goes well beyond protection of consumers
against confusion as to a product's source. It protects the design itself from
being copied. <i>See supra</i> at 1239.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, the relevant focus of the eight-factor test
should be upon potential purchasers in the marketplace. Plaintiff's replicas
present no likelihood of confusion because plaintiff provides adequate
labelling so as to prevent potential purchasers, whether in the pre-sale or
point-of-sale context, from confusing its replicas with Ferrari's automobiles.
The majority errs by expanding the target group to include the �public,� an
expansion unsupported by the language and purpose of the Lanham Act. To the
extent that the majority expands the target group, the test increasingly
protects the design from replication and the producer from dilution, rather
than the potential purchaser from confusion.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[52]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The majority does more than implicitly recognize a
dilution cause of action by its misapplication of the eight-factor test; it
expressly reads such a cause of action into the statute. To justify this
interpretation, the majority points out that Congress deleted the word
�purchasers� from the statutory language in 1967. According to the majority,
this congressional act demonstrates that Congress intended �to protect against
the cheapening and dilution of the genuine product, and to protect the
manufacturer's reputation.� I fail to see how this one congressional act leads
to such a conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As an initial matter, the majority's method of
reasoning should compel it to reach a different conclusion. In 1989, Congress
specifically considered and rejected adding an anti-dilution provision to the
Lanham Act.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[53]</span></span></span></a>
This action, it can be asserted, demonstrates that Congress does not now
consider the protection of the Lanham Act to encompass injuries to a
manufacturer based on dilution. The majority cannot look to one action of
Congress to bolster its position, but ignore other actions which undercut its
position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> More importantly, the language of the Lanham Act
does not afford such protection to producers of goods. As noted in the previous
section, the Lanham Act's protection runs to relevant consumers in the
marketplace; its protection to producers is incidental to this primary
protection. Requiring adequate labelling ensures that a producer will not have
the poor quality of a replica imputed to its product by a confused potential
purchaser. This is the only benefit accruing to a producer. Trademark dilution
is not a cause of action under the Lanham Act. <i>See Eveready Battery Co. v.
Adolph Coors Co.,</i> 765 F.Supp. 440 (N.D.Ill.1991).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The district court found that Ferrari proved, by a

Daytona Spyder and Testarossa were nonfunctional. The court based this
conclusion on the uncontroverted testimony of Angelo Bellei, who developed
Ferrari's grand touring cars from 1964-75, that the com-pany chose the exterior
designs for beauty and distinctiveness, not utility.</p>

Confusion</a></a></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider a quick example of a claim of �reverse
confusion.�&nbsp; In <i>Dreamwerks Production, Inc. v. SKG Studio</i>, 142 F.3d
1127 (9th Cir. 1998), the plaintiff had been using the mark <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>dreamwerks</span> since 1984 in connection with
services for organizing science fiction conventions in the Northeast and
Midwest of the U.S.&nbsp; In 1994, Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and
David Geffen established the massive Hollywood studio known as DreamWorks
SKG.&nbsp; The plaintiff sued for �reverse confusion.�&nbsp; It argued that
consumers would now believe that the plaintiff�s services somehow originated in
the defendant.&nbsp; In the <i>Dreamwerks</i> case, the Ninth Circuit reversed
the district court�s summary judgment in favor of the defendant and held that
the matter should go to trial.&nbsp; The court observed: �Dreamwerks notes that
whatever goodwill it has built now rests in the hands of DreamWorks; if the
latter should take a major misstep and tarnish its reputation with the public,
Dreamwerks too would be pulled down.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 1130.&nbsp; The case
eventually settled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In many typical �forward confusion� cases, such as in the <i>Virgin
Wireless</i> case above, the senior user of the mark is a much larger company
than the junior user of the mark.&nbsp; Thus, the senior Goliath claims that
the junior David�s use of the mark will likely confuse consumers into believing
that the junior�s goods are coming from the senior user, the company with which
consumers are much more familiar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By contrast, reverse confusion typically involves a
situation in which the junior user of the mark is an enormous company with the
resources extensively to advertise its use of the mark.&nbsp; The risk is that
the junior Goliath will overwhelm the meaning of the senior David�s mark, so
that consumers will believe that the senior users goods are coming from the
junior user.&nbsp; In <i>A &amp; H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria�s Secret
Stores, Inc.</i>,<i> </i>237 F.3d 198 (3d Cir. 2000), the plaintiff made
exactly this claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note, importantly, how certain of the factors in the
multifactor test for the likelihood of consumer confusion change in a reverse
confusion analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The critical question in this trademark
infringement case, before us for the second time, is whether a typical consumer
is likely to confuse MIRACLESUIT swimwear with THE MIRACLE BRA swimwear.<a
href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[54]</span></span></span></a> The former is a product of
Plaintiff A &amp; H Sportswear Company (�A &amp; H�), which manufactures ten
percent of all swimsuits made in the United States. The latter is a product of
Defendant Victoria's Secret, the lingerie leviathan that recently entered the
swimwear market. A &amp; H filed suit in the District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania claiming that The Miracle Bra swimwear mark violates
the Lanham Act because it is confusingly similar to the Miraclesuit swimwear
mark, which A &amp; H registered first. A &amp; H contends that: (1) consumers
are likely to wrongly associate The Miracle Bra with A &amp; H (the direct
confusion claim<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[55]</span></span></span></a>);
or, in the alternative, (2) consumers are likely to think that Miraclesuit is a
product of Victoria's Secret (the reverse confusion claim).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> During an extensive bench trial, A &amp; H argued
that Victoria's Secret should be enjoined from using The Miracle Bra mark for
swimwear. Finding a �possibility of confusion,� the District Court granted
relief to A &amp; H. Following an appeal to this Court that clarified that
likelihood of confusion (instead of possibility of confusion) was the correct
standard, the District Court concluded that A &amp; H had failed to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that Victoria's Secret's The Miracle Bra swimwear
mark created a likelihood of either direct or reverse confusion with the
Miraclesuit product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc.</i>, 721 F.2d
460, 463 (3d Cir.1983), this Court established a ten-factor test (the �<i>Lapp</i>�
test) to determine the likelihood of confusion for direct confusion claims
between goods that do <i>not</i> directly compete in the same market, but we
have never decided what factors should be considered in the case of directly
competing goods. The District Court therefore fashioned its own multi-factored
test that approximates, but does not completely match, the <i>Lapp</i> test. In
employing its test, the District Court acknowledged that the most important
factor was the similarity of the marks, and determined that their overall
commercial impressions were not similar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, we conclude that neither the District
Court's fact-finding nor its balancing of factors warrants reversal, and hence
we will affirm its judgment on the direct confusion claim [that there is no
likelihood of �direct� confusion].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As for the reverse confusion claim, A &amp; H
challenges the District Court's treatment as inadequate, and inconsistent with
the method laid out in our leading reverse confusion case, <i>Fisons
Horticulture, Inc. v. Vigoro Industries, Inc.</i>, 30 F.3d 466 (3d Cir.1994). <i>Fisons</i>
adopted the doctrine of reverse confusion, and used the <i>Lapp</i> factors to
assess the likelihood of such confusion, with a few minor modifications. The
District Court interpreted our precedents to require a two-step inquiry,
engaging the <i>Lapp</i> factors only after an initial assessment that the
disparity in commercial strength reached a high threshold. Because the
threshold degree of commercial disparity that the court believed was required
was not met, the court did not even examine whether there existed a likelihood
of confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After reviewing <i>Fisons</i> and our precedent, we
are persuaded that the District Court erred in fashioning a two-step inquiry,
and in failing to consider the <i>Lapp</i> factors as they apply to reverse
confusion claims. We will demonstrate that the application of some of the
factors changes in the reverse confusion context, and we conclude that, on the
record before us, the judgment must be vacated with respect to the reverse
confusion claim and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> The Miraclesuit bathing suit is made by A &amp; H,
which manufactures ten percent of all swimwear in the United States. The
Miraclesuit is distributed by Swim Shaper, a division of Mainstream Swimsuits.
The Miraclesuit is advertised as having a slimming effect on the wearer without
using uncomfortable girdle-like binds. Its material purportedly smooths out
middle body bulges and works with a flattering design to confuse the eye such
that the wearer is advised, in advertising and in tags that generally accompany
the product, that she will �[l]ook ten pounds lighter in 10 seconds[:] The ten
seconds it takes to slip it on.� Miraclesuits also include tags indicating that
they are Swim Shaper products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Miraclesuits, which sell for between $50 and $100,
come in both single pieces and bikinis. Many are equipped with push-up bras,
shaping or underwire bras, or simple, unshaped bras. They are typically sold to
trade buyers for department store sales and national mail-order catalogues,
and, on two occasions, they were featured in the Victoria's Secret catalogue. A
&amp; H received a trademark registration for the mark Miraclesuit in the fall
of 1992. The District Court found that A &amp; H has spent over $1.2 million to
advertise the Miraclesuit in magazines and trade papers, and has received the
equivalent of $1.5 million of advertising in �free publicity,� i.e., publicity
in trade magazines, consumer columns, and the general press. The advertising
and publicity campaign has been a success, and Miraclesuits constitute
approximately ten percent of all of A &amp; H's sales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> While A &amp; H is busy selling skinny waists and
midriffs, Victoria's Secret, the nation's premier lingerie seller, has focused
on instant enlargements of the bust. In 1993, Victoria's Secret released The
Miracle Bra, a padded push-up bra. Victoria's Secret filed an application to
register its The Miracle Bra trademark, and unleashed an avalanche of
advertising and publicity, ultimately spending over $13 million on The Miracle
Bra products. The campaign succeeded, and sales of The Miracle Bra products
have topped $140 million since they were first introduced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1994, Victoria's Secret's trademark application
for The Miracle Bra mark on lingerie was approved. Later that year, Victoria's
Secret moved The Miracle Bra mark into swimwear, and The Miracle Bra swimsuit
and The Miracle Bra bikini started appearing in Victoria's Secret catalogues.
(The Miracle Bra lingerie and swimwear are sold only in Victoria's Secret
stores and catalogues.). The cost of The Miracle Bra swimwear varies, but it is
typically in the neighborhood of $70, and The Miracle Bra and Victoria's Secret
tags are prominently featured on all swimwear. This product also succeeded: The
total sales of The Miracle Bra swimsuits reached $28 million by summer 1997.
The last critical fact regarding this swimwear is that, as a result of this
litigation, Victoria's Secret has committed itself to using the following
disclaimer with all promotion, advertising, and sales of The Miracle Bra: �The
Miracle Bra Swimwear Collection is exclusive to Victoria's Secret and is not
associated with Miraclesuit by Swimshaper.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1995, after this litigation began, Victoria's
Secret applied to the PTO for a trademark for The Miracle Bra for swimsuits,
bathing suits, and bikinis. Because it had previously conducted a search for
The Miracle Bra as applied to lingerie, which had led it to the conclusion that
The Miracle Bra did not threaten to infringe on other trademarks, Victoria's
Secret had not conducted a separate trademark search of The Miracle Bra
trademark as it applied to swimwear. However, the PTO examining attorney denied
Victoria's Secret's application due to its similarity to Miraclesuit because he
determined that: (1) �Miracle� was the dominant feature of each mark; and (2)
the product lines overlap. The denial was not appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=Centered>V. The Reverse Confusion Claim</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. Introduction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We recently recognized the doctrine of �reverse
confusion� as a distinct basis for a claim under � 43(a) of the Lanham Act. <i>See</i>
<i>Fisons</i>, 30 F.3d at 475. While the essence of a direct confusion claim is
that a junior user of a mark is said to free-ride on the �reputation and good
will of the senior user by adopting a similar or identical mark,� <i>id.</i>,
reverse confusion occurs when �the junior user saturates the market with a
similar trademark and overwhelms the senior user.� <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Ameritech,
Inc. v. American Info. Techs. Corp.</i>, 811 F.2d 960, 964 (6th Cir.1987)). The
harm flowing from reverse confusion is that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[t]he public comes to assume the senior user's products are
really the junior user's or that the former has become somehow connected to the
latter.... [T]he senior user loses the value of the trademark&#8212;its product
identity, corporate identity, control over its goodwill and reputation, and
ability to move into new markets.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Ameritech, Inc</i>., 811 F.2d at 964; <i>see also
Fisons</i>, 30 F.3d at 479; <i>Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co</i>.,
978 F.2d 947, 957 (7th Cir.1992); <i>Banff, Ltd. v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc</i>.,
841 F.2d 486, 490&#8211;91 (2d Cir.1988); <i>Capital Films Corp. v. Charles
Fries Prods, Inc.</i>, 628 F.2d 387, 393 (5th Cir.1980); B<i>ig O Tire Dealers,
Inc., v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co</i>., 561 F.2d 1365, 1372 (10th
Cir.1977). As we explained in <i>Fisons</i>, reverse confusion protects
�smaller senior users ... against larger, more powerful companies who want to
use identical or confusingly similar trademarks.� 30 F.3d at 475. Absent
reverse confusion, �a company with a well established trade name and with the
economic power to advertise extensively [would be immunized from suit] for a
product name taken from a competitor.� <i>Big O Tire Dealers, Inc</i>., 561
F.2d at 1372 (citation omitted). The doctrine of reverse confusion&#8212;or, at
least, some of its applications&#8212;is not without its critics. <i>See, e.g</i>.,
Thad G. Long &amp; Alfred M. Marks, Reverse Confusion: Fundamentals and Limits,
84 Trademark Rep. 1, 2&#8211;3 (1994); Daniel D. Domenico, Note, Mark Madness:
How Brent Musburger and the Miracle Bra May Have Led to a More Equitable and
Efficient Understanding of the Reverse Confusion Doctrine in Trademark Law, 86
Va.L.Rev. 597, 613&#8211;14, 621&#8211;24 (2000). The chief danger inherent in
recognizing reverse confusion claims is that innovative junior users, who have
invested heavily in promoting a particular mark, will suddenly find their use
of the mark blocked by plaintiffs who have not invested in, or promoted, their
own marks. <i>See</i> <i>Weiner King, Inc. v. Wiener King Corp</i>., 615 F.2d
512, 522 (C.C.P.A.1980). Further, an overly-vigorous use of the doctrine of
reverse confusion could potentially inhibit larger companies with established
marks from expanding their product lines&#8212;for instance, had Victoria's
Secret thought, at the outset, that it would not be permitted carry over its
popular The Miracle Bra mark from lingerie to swimwear, it might have chosen
not to enter the swimsuit market at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This would be an undesirable result; in fact, it is
precisely to allow a certain amount of �space� for companies to expand their
product lines under established marks that we allow infringement suits against
suppliers of noncompeting goods. <i>See</i> <i>Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc.</i>,
721 F.2d 460, 464 (3d Cir.1983). This is not to say that the reverse confusion
doctrine does not have its proper place; as has been recognized, without the
existence of such a claim, smaller business owners might not have any incentive
to invest in their marks at all, for fear the mark could be usurped at will by
a larger competitor. <i>See</i> <i>SK &amp; F, Co. v. Premo Pharm. Labs., Inc.</i>,
625 F.2d 1055, 1067 (3d Cir.1980) (�[P]ermitting piracy of ... identifying
trade dress can only discourage other manufacturers from making a similar
individual promotional effort.�). However, these concerns do sensitize us to
the potential untoward effects of an overenthusiastic enforcement of reverse
confusion claims, although they cannot supersede our judicial recognition of
the doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. The Test for Reverse Confusion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As in a direct confusion claim, the ultimate
question in a reverse confusion claim is whether there is a likelihood of
consumer confusion as to the source or sponsorship of a product. <i>See</i> <i>Fisons</i>,
30 F.3d at 475. Although it would seem somewhat counterintuitive to posit that
the likelihood of confusion analysis changes from the direct confusion to the
reverse confusion context,<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[57]</span></span></span></a>
there are differences between the two situations that bear mentioning.
Therefore, to clarify the test for reverse confusion that has developed in our
jurisprudence, we will walk through the factors that a district court should
consider (where relevant) in assessing a such a claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. The Factors that are the Same</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As an initial matter, there are several factors
that should generally be analyzed in the same way for a reverse confusion claim
as they are for a direct confusion claim.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[58]</span></span></span></a>
First, the attentiveness of consumers does not change (factor (3)); in both
direct and reverse confusion, the question is whether this is the kind of
product that consumers will care enough about to notice the differences, or
purchase hastily with only a limited impression. <i>See</i> <i>Fisons</i>, 30
F.3d at 476 n. 12 (considering this factor in the same manner as it would for
direct confusion). Second, and similarly, the degree to which the channels of
trade and advertisement overlap (factor (7)) should be analyzed in the same
fashion. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 475&#8211;76 (analyzing the channels of trade
in the same manner). Finally, <i>Lapp</i> factors (8) and (9), considering the
similarity of the targets of the parties' sales efforts and the similarity of
products, are also analyzed no differently in the reverse confusion context. <i>See</i>
<i>id.</i> at 475, 481 (treating these factors in the same way for reverse
confusion as they would have been treated for direct confusion).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. Similarity of the Marks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Generally speaking, the similarity of the marks
themselves is necessarily analyzed in the same way in direct and reverse
confusion claims; the court looks to sight, sound, and meaning, and compares
whether these elements combine to create a general commercial impression that
is the same for the two marks. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Fisons</i>, 30 F.3d at
478&#8211;79 (analyzing the commercial impression of the marks in light of
direct confusion principles). Therefore, a district court would not need to
examine these in a different manner than it would in a direct confusion claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the other hand, the direct confusion claim in
this case was rejected by the District Court in considerable measure because
the court felt that the Victoria's Secret housemark, coupled with the
disclaimer, alleviated any confusion that might otherwise result. <i>See</i> <i>A
&amp; H IV</i>, 57 F.Supp.2d at 168&#8211;69. Yet in the reverse confusion
context, the presence of housemarks or disclaimers must obviously be treated
differently than in the direct confusion context. It is the essence of the
reverse confusion claim that, when consumers come across the Miraclesuit in the
stream of commerce, they will confuse it with The Miracle Bra and think that it
is a Victoria's Secret product. Therefore, the weight of a disclaimer on the
Victoria's Secret product is necessarily lessened. Because A &amp; H puts no
disclaimer on its product to distinguish it from The Miracle Bra, the consumer
considering a purchase of the Miraclesuit will not have the same handy reminder
that Miraclesuit is not associated with The Miracle Bra or Victoria's Secret.
This is not to say that such a disclaimer may not, in fact, mitigate confusion
in some cases; if consumers are faced with the disclaimer every time they flip
through the Victoria's Secret catalogue, they are less likely to forget that
Miraclesuit is unrelated to The Miracle Bra swimwear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As to the presence of the housemark on the
Victoria's Secret product, not only is there the possibility that consumers
will fail to remember the mark when encountering A &amp; H's swimwear, but
there is also the possibility that the mark will <i>aggravate</i>, rather than
mitigate, reverse confusion, by reinforcing the association of the word
�miracle� exclusively with Victoria's Secret. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Sands,
Taylor &amp; Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co.</i>, 978 F.2d 947, 960 (7th Cir.1992);
<i>Americana Trading Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co.</i>, 966 F.2d 1284, 1288
(9th Cir.1992). Of course, we do not suggest that this actually occurred in
this particular case; after all, the District Court observed that A &amp; H
typically includes its own housemark on Miraclesuits, <i>see</i> <i>A &amp; H
IV</i>, 57 F.Supp.2d at 160, but, because the court only conducted a likelihood
of confusion analysis for the direct confusion claim, it only briefly addressed
the significance of the A &amp; H housemark, <i>see</i> <i>id.</i> at 168 n.
17.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Clearly, the proper significance to be accorded
these facts is a matter best suited for the determination of the trial court.
Instead, we merely highlight the questions raised by the use of the housemarks
and disclaimers in order to emphasize that a district court must separately
examine the similarity factor to determine whether there are any aspects of the
analysis that should be different for a reverse confusion claim, and, if so,
alter its examination accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. Strength of the Marks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> An important difference between reverse and direct
confusion manifests in the analysis of the strength of the marks. As we
explained <i>supra</i>, this factor requires consideration both of the mark's
commercial and conceptual strength. For ease of understanding, we will explain
the appropriate treatment of commercial strength first, and the treatment of
conceptual strength second.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>a. Commercial Strength</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It has been observed that a consumer first
encountering a mark with one set of goods is likely to continue to associate
the mark with those goods, and whether any subsequent confusion is �direct� or
�reverse� will depend on whether the consumer's first experience was with the
junior or the senior user of the mark. <i>See</i> <i>Banff, Ltd. v. Federated
Dep't Stores, Inc.</i>, 841 F.2d 486, 490 (2d Cir.1988) (acknowledging such a
possibility); Long &amp; Marks, <i>supra</i>, at 5. The greater the commercial
disparity between the manufacturers, the more likely it is that a consumer's
first experience with a mark will be with one particular manufacturer. That is,
if one manufacturer&#8212;junior or senior&#8212;expends tremendous sums in advertising
while the other does not, consumers will be more likely to encounter the
heavily advertised mark first. Where the greater advertising originates from
the senior user, we are more likely to see a case of direct confusion; if the
greater advertising originates from the junior user, reverse confusion is more
likely. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy, <i>supra</i>, � 23:10, at 23&#8211;32; <i>cf.</i>
<i>Fisons</i>, 30 F.3d at 479 (observing that direct confusion involves a
junior user �trad[ing] on� a senior user's name and thus expending less on
advertising, whereas reverse confusion involves the opposite pattern).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Logically, then, in a direct confusion claim, a
plaintiff with a commercially strong mark is more likely to prevail than a
plaintiff with a commercially weak mark. Conversely, in a reverse confusion
claim, a plaintiff with a commercially weak mark is more likely to prevail than
a plaintiff with a stronger mark, and this is particularly true when the
plaintiff's weaker mark is pitted against a defendant with a far stronger mark.
McCarthy has written that �the relatively large advertising and promotion of
the <i>junior</i> user ... is the hallmark of a reverse confusion case.� 3
McCarthy, <i>supra</i>, � 23:10, at 23&#8211;37. �[T]he lack of commercial
strength of the smaller senior user's mark is to be given less weight in the
analysis because it is the strength of the larger, junior user's mark which
results in reverse confusion.� <i>Commerce Nat'l Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Commerce
Ins. Agency, Inc.</i>, 214 F.3d 432, 444 (3d Cir.2000). As we explained in <i>Fisons</i>,
�the evidence of commercial strength is different from what we expect in a case
of forward confusion, where the junior user tries to palm off his goods as
those of the senior user.� 30 F.3d at 479.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, in a reverse confusion claim, a court
should analyze the �commercial strength� factor in terms of (1) the commercial
strength of the junior user as compared to the senior user; and (2) any
advertising or marketing campaign by the junior user that has resulted in a
saturation in the public awareness of the junior user's mark. <i>See</i> <i>Fisons</i>,
30 F.3d at 474, 479.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>b. Distinctiveness or Conceptual Strength</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Fisons</i> we remanded the case for the
district court to �reevaluate [ ] ... distinctiveness as well as [the mark's]
commercial strength� for the reverse confusion claim. <i>Fisons</i>, 30 F.3d at
479. Although we explained that the evaluation of commercial strength would
have to be altered for reverse confusion claims, we did not discuss how
distinctiveness, or conceptual strength, should be re-weighed in light of our
adoption of the reverse confusion doctrine. Nor did we clarify this aspect of
our jurisprudence in <i>Commerce National Insurance Services, Inc. v. Commerce
Insurance Agency, Inc.</i>, 214 F.3d 432 (3d Cir.2000), where we referred to
the different test for �commercial strength,� in a reverse confusion context,
without reference to �conceptual strength.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As stated above, in the paradigmatic reverse
confusion case, the senior user has a commercially weak mark when compared with
the junior user's commercially strong mark. When it comes to conceptual
strength, however, we believe that, just as in direct confusion cases, a strong
mark should weigh in favor of a senior user. Our decision is supported by the
fact that those courts that have clearly distinguished conceptual from
commercial strength in the reverse confusion context have weighed a
conceptually strong mark in the senior user's favor, in the same manner as they
would in direct confusion cases. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Worthington Foods, Inc.
v. Kellogg Co.</i>, 732 F.Supp. 1417, 1456 (S.D.Ohio 1990).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>H. Lubovsky, Inc. v. Esprit de Corp.</i>, 627
F.Supp. 483 (S.D.N.Y.1986), the court explained that conceptual distinctiveness
was relevant in the same way for a reverse confusion claim because �if a customer
saw a doll in a toy store bearing a strong familiar trademark like �Exxon,� he
might well assume that the oil company had gone into the toy business; if, on
the other hand, he saw a doll bearing a familiar but weak laudatory trademark
like Merit, he would be unlikely to assume that it is connected with the
similarly named gasoline or cigarettes.� <i>Id.</i> at 487; <i>see also</i>
Long &amp; Marks, <i>supra</i>, at 22.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The <i>H. Lubovsky</i> logic resonates, for it
makes more sense to hold that conceptual strength, unlike commercial strength,
works in the plaintiff's favor. That is, if we were to apply the rule stated
above for commercial strength, i.e., weighing weakness in the plaintiff's
favor, we would bring about the perverse result that less imaginative marks
would be more likely to win reverse confusion claims than arbitrary or fanciful
ones. We therefore hold that, as in direct confusion claims, a district court
should weigh a conceptually strong mark in the plaintiff's favor, particularly
when the mark is of such a distinctive character that, coupled with the
relative similarity of the plaintiff's and defendant's marks, a consumer
viewing the plaintiff's product is likely to assume that such a mark would only
have been adopted by a single source&#8212;i.e., the defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>4. The Intent of the Defendant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the direct confusion context, the intent of the
defendant is relevant to the extent that it bears on the likelihood of
confusion analysis. As we have said:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the likelihood of confusion inquiry ... we do not focus
on a defendant's bare intent to adopt a mark ... substantially identical to a
plaintiff's mark ..., since there is little basis in fact or logic for
supposing from a defendant's intent to copy without more that the defendant's
actions will in fact result in confusion. Thus, what we have held is that a
defendant's intent to confuse or deceive consumers as to the product's source
may be highly probative of likelihood of confusion.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Versa Prods. Co., Inc. v. Bifold Co. (Mfg.) Ltd.</i>,
50 F.3d 189, 205 (3d Cir.1995) (emphasis omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When reverse, rather than direct, confusion is
alleged, �intent to confuse� is unlikely to be present. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Fisons</i>,
30 F.3d at 480. However, though perhaps unusual, should an intent to confuse
exist, it would be relevant to the likelihood of confusion analysis in the same
manner as it would for a direct confusion claim. For instance, in <i>Commerce
National Insurance Services, Inc. v. Commerce Insurance Agency, Inc.</i>, 214
F.3d 432 (3d Cir.2000), we were confronted with a situation in which the
litigants had used very similar marks in noncompetitive industries for a number
of years, each fully aware of the other and with no incidents of actual
confusion. Eventually, however, the larger company expanded into the smaller
company's line of business, deliberately choosing to promote its services under
an almost identical mark. In holding that the smaller company could maintain
its claim against the larger for reverse confusion, we specifically highlighted
the possibility that the larger company had adopted the mark with the
deliberate intent of pushing its rival out of the market, and that it was this
sort of usurpation of business identity that the reverse confusion doctrine was
designed to prevent. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 445.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we have noted in our two prior cases on this
issue, the defendant's intent may be discovered through such inquiries as
whether the defendant was aware of the senior user's mark when it adopted its
own mark, and whether the defendant considered that its adoption of the mark
might result in confusion. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 444; <i>Fisons</i>, 30 F.3d
at 480. If such an intent to confuse does, in fact, exist in a reverse
confusion case, it should weigh against the defendant in the same manner as it
would in a direct confusion case. <i>Cf.</i> <i>W.W.W. Pharm. Co., Inc. v.
Gillette Co.</i>, 984 F.2d 567, 575 (2d Cir.1993) (weighing the �intent� factor
in a reverse confusion case in the defendant's favor because the plaintiff had
not demonstrated an intent to confuse).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although we recognize that our opinion in <i>Fisons</i>
perhaps implied that mere carelessness, as opposed to deliberate intent to
confuse, would weigh in a plaintiff's favor in a reverse confusion case, we are
reluctant to adopt such an interpretation, as it would be manifestly out of
step with our prior holdings regarding the relevance of �intent� in trademark
infringement claims. <i>Cf.</i> <i>O. Hommel Co. v. Ferro Corp.</i>, 659 F.2d
340, 354 (3d Cir.1981). Ultimately, all of the <i>Lapp</i> factors are meant
only to determine whether <i>confusion</i> is likely; mere carelessness, like
deliberate copying, does not shed any light on this inquiry. Further, to the
extent that the intent inquiry in the likelihood of confusion analysis carries
with it the attribution of fault, there is no reason to ascribe higher
penalties to a lower degree of fault because a particular case involves
reverse, rather than direct, confusion. Finally, in light of the policy
concerns implicated by the reverse confusion doctrine, it would be troubling
indeed to hold that a <i>lesser</i> degree of culpability would weigh in the
plaintiff's favor for a reverse confusion claim than it would for a direct
confusion claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>5. Factors Relating to Actual Confusion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As a matter of intuition, one would expect that in
a reverse confusion claim, evidence of actual confusion would be as important
as in a direct confusion claim, though the nature of the confusion that would
be probative would be quite different. <i>See</i> <i>Lang v. Retirement Living
Publ'g Co.</i>, 949 F.2d 576, 583 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that evidence of
�actual confusion� in which the public thought the senior user was the origin
of the junior user's products was irrelevant for a reverse confusion claim). As
applied to this case, for example, evidence that consumers thought that The
Miracle Bra was an A &amp; H product would be probative on a direct confusion
claim, but not on a reverse confusion claim. Conversely, evidence that
consumers thought that Miraclesuit was a Victoria's Secret product would
support a reverse confusion claim, but not a direct confusion claim. This was
apparently the District Court's intuition; although it declined to consider A
&amp; H's reverse confusion claim, it did observe that most of the evidence A
&amp; H had put forth with regard to �actual confusion� related to direct,
rather than reverse, confusion. <i>See</i> <i>A &amp; H IV</i>, 57 F.Supp.2d at
178 n. 32.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> However, marshalling evidence of actual confusion
is often difficult. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Liquid Glass Enters., Inc. v. Dr. Ing.
h.c.F. Porsche AG</i>, 8 F.Supp.2d 398, 403 (D.N.J.1998). In our view, if we
were to create a rigid division between �direct� and �reverse� confusion
evidence, we would run the risk of denying recovery to meritorious plaintiffs.
For example, if a plaintiff alleged theories of both direct and reverse
confusion and was able to prove a few instances of �actual� confusion in each
direction, we might conclude that the plaintiff did not have enough evidence of
either type to succeed on either of its claims, even though, taken together,
all of the evidence of actual confusion would be probative of a real problem.
As we explained in Part V.B.3, <i>supra</i>, the manifestation of consumer
confusion as �direct� or �reverse� may merely be a function of the context in
which the consumer first encountered the mark. Isolated instances of �direct�
confusion may occur in a reverse confusion case, and vice-versa. <i>See</i>
Long &amp; Marks, <i>supra</i>, at 5. Though we might expect that, in most
instances, the consumer's first encounter will be with the mark that has
greater commercial strength, this will not invariably be the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Given the problems litigants typically encounter in
locating evidence of actual confusion, then, we decline to create a strict bar
to the use of �direct� confusion evidence in a �reverse� confusion case, or
vice versa. However, evidence working in the same direction as the claim is
preferred, and �misfitting� evidence must be treated carefully, for large
amounts of one type of confusion in a claim for a different type may in fact
work against the plaintiff. For instance, the existence of reverse confusion
might disprove a plaintiff's claim that its descriptive mark has secondary
meaning, thus resulting in no recovery at all. <i>See</i> <i>Jefferson Home
Furniture Co., Inc. v. Jefferson Furniture Co., Inc.</i>, 349 So.2d 5, 8
(Ala.1977).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It follows that the other factor relating to actual
confusion, <i>Lapp</i> factor (4), examining the time the mark has been used
without evidence of actual confusion, should be approached similarly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>6. Other Relevant Facts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The final factor of the <i>Lapp</i> test directs
courts to look at �other facts suggesting that the consuming public might
expect the prior owner to manufacture both products, or expect the prior owner
to manufacture a product in the defendant's market, or expect that the prior
owner is likely to expand into the defendant's market.� This factor is
necessarily transformed in the reverse confusion context to an examination of
other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the larger, more
powerful company to manufacture both products, or expect the larger company to
manufacture a product in the plaintiff's market, or expect that the larger
company is likely to expand into the plaintiff's market. <i>See</i> <i>Fisons</i>,
30 F.3d at 480 (directing the district court to examine facts suggesting that
the public might think that the junior user would expand into the senior user's
market).</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> As with the test for direct confusion, no one
factor is dispositive, and in individual cases, particular factors may not be
probative on the issue of likelihood of confusion. �The weight given to each

defendant, must be done on an individual fact-specific basis.� <i>Fisons</i>,

<p class=Centered>D. Guidance for Remand</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. Introduction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Inasmuch as we have clarified the law of reverse
confusion in this circuit by filling the gaps left in <i>Fisons</i>, it will be
useful to the District Court if we comment on the extent to which it needs to
revisit the various issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span>2. Similarity of the Marks</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When addressing the direct confusion claim, the
District Court placed great weight on the presence of Victoria's Secret's
housemark and disclaimer when it concluded that the marks were not confusingly
similar. <i>See</i> <i>A &amp; H IV</i>, 57 F.Supp.2d at 168&#8211;69. However,
as we explained <i>supra</i>, although such embellishments of the junior user's
mark may still have relevance in the reverse confusion context, their weight
must necessarily be reevaluated. Therefore, on remand, the District Court
should reconsider the similarity of the marks in light of A &amp; H's reverse
confusion claims.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span>3. Strength of the Marks</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The District Court did not consider the commercial
strength of the marks within the ambit of the reverse confusion <i>Fisons</i>
analysis, but it functionally did as&nbsp; much in its �threshold� determination
that A &amp; H lacked sufficient �economic disparity� relative to Victoria's
Secret to advance a reverse confusion claim. Therefore, the District Court
essentially demonstrated that it weighed this factor in favor of Victoria's
Secret. However, in comparing the relative commercial strengths of the
products, the District Court committed clear error: Although it considered the
free publicity received by A &amp; H in determining its commercial strength, it
did not consider the free publicity received by Victoria's Secret. This led to
an inaccurate comparison of their relative commercial vitality. Had the court
used the same calipers to measure the commercial strength of each, it might
have determined that the Miraclesuit had less commercial strength relative to
The Miracle Bra. Of course, the court might well deem the difference
unimportant, but we cannot say that either Victoria's Secret or A &amp; H
should have this factor weighed in its favor as a matter of law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Furthermore, the court should have also considered
the conceptual strength of the Miraclesuit mark, according to the standards for
conceptual strength set forth in Sections IV.B and V.B.3, <i>supra</i>. In so
doing, the court must gauge the strength of the Miraclesuit mark and must
consider whether&#8212;as with the example set forth <i>supra</i> involving a
doll with the mark �Exxon�&#8212;the Miracle Bra/Miraclesuit marks are so
distinctive that, when considered simultaneously with the court's determination
as to their similarities, consumers with a general awareness of The Miracle Bra
swimsuit are likely to assume that the Miraclesuit is a Victoria's Secret
product.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span>4. Intent</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In its evaluation of A &amp; H's direct confusion
claim, the District Court concluded that Victoria's Secret's �choice to extend
The Miracle Bra mark to swimwear was for legitimate reasons, rather than out of
bad faith.� <i>A &amp; H IV</i>, 57 F.Supp.2d at 172. However, because it
�decline[d] to examine whether a likelihood of reverse confusion exists,� <i>id.</i>
at 178, the District Court focused on whether Victoria's Secret had intended to
�profit[ ] from the notoriety of Plaintiffs' Miraclesuit mark,� <i>A &amp; H IV</i>,
57 F.Supp.2d at 173&#8211;74. The court did not specifically address the
question whether Victoria's Secret, rather than intending to �free ride� on A
&amp; H's goodwill, instead intended to usurp it by deliberately undertaking to
cause consumer confusion (and thereby destroy A &amp; H's business identity).
On remand, the District Court should consider whether its previous finding of
Victoria's Secret's good faith is dispositive of the reverse confusion intent
analysis, or whether further examination of this issue is warranted.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><span>E. Summary</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although we believe that the District Court's
evaluation of individual factors relating to market, sales, and functionality
would have remained unchanged had it examined A &amp; H's reverse confusion
claim in light of the <i>Lapp</i> factors, we simply do not know how it would
have treated the commercial strength and mark similarity factors had it
considered the free advertising The Miracle Bra received, or the effect of the
housemark and disclaimer in the reverse confusion context. We also cannot
predict what the result would have been had the District Court examined the
�intent� factor in light of A &amp; H's reverse confusion claim, or how the
District Court would have weighed the various factors had it not determined
that there was a threshold commercial disparity requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The question of likelihood of confusion is
ultimately one of fact, and we cannot roll up our sleeves and engage in the
balancing ourselves. In its balancing on the direct confusion claim, the
District Court found that the case was close, holding that no likelihood of
confusion existed �solely <i>based on the presumption</i> that Defendants will
continue to use the disclaimer when marketing The Miracle Bra swimwear,� <i>A&nbsp;
&amp; H IV</i>, 57 F.Supp.2d at 169. As we have explained, we believe that
Victoria's Secret's disclaimer has a lessened significance for reverse
confusion. We also believe that the conceptual strength of the Miraclesuit mark
must be reevaluated. Under these circumstances, we cannot say as a matter of
law that a different weighing of the factors could not have influenced the
District Court to make a different finding of ultimate fact, thus necessitating
a remand.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc392164825">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverse Passing
Off</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Reverse passing off� generally involves situations in which
a �defendant &nbsp;falsely takes credit for another�s goods or services,� <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>McCarthy</span> � 25.6.&nbsp; More
specifically, reverse passing off occurs when the defendant passes off as its
own product (or service) what was in fact made (or performed) by the plaintiff,
perhaps to gain the goodwill that the plaintiff�s product might generate for
the defendant, perhaps simply to meet a production deadline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reverse passing off is an exceedingly rare cause of action,
even more so after the case below, <i>Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox
Film Corp</i>., 539 U.S. 23 (2003).&nbsp; We consider reverse passing off and
the <i>Dastar</i> case because of the profound policy questions implicated by
the cause of action and the facts of the <i>Dastar</i> case.&nbsp; Recall that
one advantage trademark protection enjoys over copyright or patent protection
is that trademark protection is unlimited in time, provided that the trademark
owner continue to use the mark in commerce.&nbsp; Thus, when patent or
copyright protection of a product feature expires, the patent or copyright
owner may continue to exert control over that feature through trademark law
(provided that the feature satisfies the various requirements of trademark
protection).&nbsp; This raises significant concerns.&nbsp; Consider the example
of the Mickey Mouse image mark, whose registration is shown below:</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent align=center style='text-align:center'><span><img
border=0 width=289 height=292 id="_x0000_i1037"
src="BeebeTMLaw-PartII-v1.0_files/image013.png"></span></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>At some point, Disney�s copyright rights in the
countless cartoons in which Mickey Mouse is depicted will begin to
expire.&nbsp; But can Disney then use its trademark rights in the image of the
character to prevent others from reproducing these cartoons?&nbsp; With
copyright law, the public agrees to grant short-term exclusive rights to the
author of a work in order to incentivize authorship, but an exceedingly
important part of that bargain is that these rights will eventually expire and
the work will be dedicated to the public domain, free for anyone to use in any
way.&nbsp; Should trademark rights be allowed to trump this basic bargain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Dastar</i>,<i> </i>the respondent sought to assert,
through trademark law, continued control over expression in which it had lost
its copyright rights.&nbsp; As you read through <i>Dastar</i>, consider the
following questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Does <i>Dastar</i> resolve the question of whether Disney may
continue to assert exclusive rights through trademark law after its copyright
claims have expired?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>�<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Should trademark law and specifically the concept of �reverse
passing off� provide a cause of action for plagiarism of someone else�s
ideas?&nbsp; More specifically, if I take someone else�s product, merely
re-label it with my own trademark, and sell that product as my own, then I
would likely be liable for the �reverse passing off� of someone else�s product
as my own.&nbsp; Should the same principle apply if I take someone else�s
original expression or ideas and pass them off as my own original expression or
ideas?&nbsp; If not, why are expression and ideas different?</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1948, three and a half years after the German
surrender at Reims, General Dwight D. Eisenhower completed Crusade in Europe,
his written account of the allied campaign in Europe during World War II.
Doubleday published the book, registered it with the Copyright Office in 1948,
and granted exclusive television rights to an affiliate of respondent Twentieth
Century Fox Film Corporation (Fox). Fox, in turn, arranged for Time, Inc., to
produce a television series, also called Crusade in Europe, based on the book,
and Time assigned its copyright in the series to Fox. The television series,
consisting of 26 episodes, was first broadcast in 1949. It combined a
soundtrack based on a narration of the book with film footage from the United
States Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, the British Ministry of Information and War
Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified �Newsreel Pool
Cameramen.� In 1975, Doubleday renewed the copyright on the book as the
��proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.�� App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a.
Fox, however, did not renew the copyright on the Crusade television series,
which expired in 1977, leaving the television series in the public domain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights in
General Eisenhower's book, including the exclusive right to distribute the
Crusade television series on video and to sublicense others to do so.
Respondents SFM Entertainment and New Line Home Video, Inc., in turn, acquired
from Fox the exclusive rights to distribute Crusade on video. SFM obtained the
negatives of the original television series, restored them, and repackaged the
series on videotape; New Line distributed the videotapes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Enter petitioner Dastar. In 1995, Dastar decided to
expand its product line from music compact discs to videos. Anticipating
renewed interest in World War II on the 50th anniversary of the war's end,
Dastar released a video set entitled World War II Campaigns in Europe. To make
Campaigns, Dastar purchased eight beta cam tapes of the <i>original </i>version
of the Crusade television series, which is in the public domain, copied them,
and then edited the series. Dastar's Campaigns series is slightly more than half
as long as the original Crusade television series. Dastar substituted a new
opening sequence, credit page, and final closing for those of the Crusade
television series; inserted new chapter-title sequences and narrated chapter
introductions; moved the �recap� in the Crusade television series to the
beginning and retitled it as a �preview�; and removed references to and images
of the book. Dastar created new packaging for its Campaigns series and (as
already noted) a new title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dastar manufactured and sold the Campaigns video
set as its own product. The advertising states: �Produced and Distributed by: <i>Entertainment
Distributing</i> � (which is owned by Dastar), and makes no reference to the
Crusade television series. Similarly, the screen credits state �DASTAR CORP
presents� and �an ENTERTAINMENT DISTRIBUTING Production,� and list as executive
producer, producer, and associate producer employees of Dastar. Supp.App.
2&#8211;3, 30. The Campaigns videos themselves also make no reference to the
Crusade television series, New Line's Crusade videotapes, or the book. Dastar
sells its Campaigns videos to Sam's Club, Costco, Best Buy, and other retailers
and mail-order companies for $25 per set, substantially less than New Line's
video set.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In 1998, respondents Fox, SFM, and New Line brought
this action alleging that Dastar's sale of its Campaigns video set infringes
Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower's book and, thus, their exclusive
television rights in the book. Respondents later amended their complaint to add
claims that Dastar's sale of Campaigns �without proper credit� to the Crusade
television series constitutes �reverse passing off�<a href="#_ftn59"

the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a), and in violation of state
unfair-competition law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a. On cross-motions for
summary judgment, the District Court found for respondents on all three counts,
<i>id.,</i> at 54a&#8211;55a, treating its resolution of the Lanham Act claim
as controlling on the state-law unfair-competition claim because �the ultimate
test under both is whether the public is likely to be deceived or confused,� <i>id.,</i>
at 54a. The court awarded Dastar's profits to respondents and doubled them
pursuant to � 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. � 1117(a), to deter future
infringing conduct by petitioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span

the judgment for respondents on the Lanham Act claim, but reversed as to the
copyright claim and remanded. 34 Fed.Appx. 312, 316 (2002). (It said nothing
with regard to the state-law claim.) With respect to the Lanham Act claim, the
Court of Appeals reasoned that �Dastar copied substantially the entire <i>Crusade
in Europe</i> series created by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the resulting
product with a different name and marketed it without attribution to Fox[, and]
therefore committed a �bodily appropriation� of Fox's series.� <i>Id.,</i> at
314. It concluded that �Dastar's �bodily appropriation� of Fox's original

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Lanham Act was intended to make �actionable the
deceptive and misleading use of marks,� and �to protect persons engaged in ...
commerce against unfair competition.� 15 U.S.C. � 1127. While much of the
Lanham Act addresses the registration, use, and infringement of trademarks and
related marks, � 43(a), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a) is one of the few provisions that
goes beyond trademark protection. As originally enacted, � 43(a) created a
federal remedy against a person who used in commerce either �a false
designation of origin, or any false description or representation� in
connection with �any goods or services.� 60 Stat. 441. As the Second Circuit
accurately observed with regard to the original enactment, however&#8212;and as
remains true after the 1988 revision&#8212;� 43(a) �does not have boundless
application as a remedy for unfair trade practices,� <i>Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. v.
Interstate Cigar Co.,</i> 499 F.2d 232, 237 (C.A.2 1974). �[B]ecause of its
inherently limited wording, � 43(a) can never be a federal �codification� of
the overall law of �unfair competition,� � 4 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair
Competition � 27:7, p. 27&#8211;14 (4th ed. 2002) (McCarthy), but can apply
only to certain unfair trade practices prohibited by its text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although a case can be made that a proper reading
of � 43(a), as originally enacted, would treat the word �origin� as referring
only �to the geographic location in which the goods originated,� <i>Two Pesos,
Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 777, (1992) (STEVENS, J.,
concurring in judgment),<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[61]</span></span></span></a>
the Courts of Appeals considering the issue, beginning with the Sixth Circuit,
unanimously concluded that it �does not merely refer to geographical origin,
but also to origin of source or manufacture,� <i>Federal&#8211;Mogul&#8211;Bower
Bearings, Inc. v. Azoff,</i> 313 F.2d 405, 408 (C.A.6 1963), thereby creating a
federal cause of action for traditional trademark infringement of unregistered
marks. See 4 McCarthy � 27:14; <i>Two Pesos, supra,</i> at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753.
Moreover, every Circuit to consider the issue found � 43(a) broad enough to
encompass reverse passing off. See, <i>e.g., Williams v. Curtiss&#8211;Wright
Corp.,</i> 691 F.2d 168, 172 (C.A.3 1982); <i>Arrow United Indus., Inc. v. Hugh
Richards, Inc.,</i> 678 F.2d 410, 415 (C.A.2 1982); <i>F.E.L. Publications,
Ltd. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago,</i> 214 USPQ 409, 416, 1982 WL 19198 (C.A.7
1982); <i>Smith v. Montoro,</i> 648 F.2d 602, 603 (C.A.9 1981);<i> Bangor Punta
Operations, Inc. v. Universal Marine Co.,</i> 543 F.2d 1107, 1109 (C.A.5 1976).
The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 made clear that � 43(a) covers origin of
production as well as geographic origin.<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[62]</span></span></span></a>
Its language is amply inclusive, moreover, of reverse passing off&#8212;if
indeed it does not implicitly adopt the unanimous court-of-appeals
jurisprudence on that subject. See, <i>e.g., ALPO Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston
Purina Co.,</i> 913 F.2d 958, 963&#8211;964, n. 6 (C.A.D.C.1990) (Thomas, J.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, as it comes to us, the gravamen of
respondents' claim is that, in marketing and selling Campaigns as its own
product without acknowledging its nearly wholesale reliance on the Crusade
television series, Dastar has made a �false designation of origin, false or
misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact,
which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin ... of his or her
goods.� � 43(a). See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents 8, 11. That claim
would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought some of New Line's Crusade
videotapes and merely repackaged them as its own. Dastar's alleged wrongdoing,
however, is vastly different: It took a creative work in the public
domain&#8212;the Crusade television series&#8212;copied it, made modifications
(arguably minor), and produced its very own series of videotapes. If �origin�
refers only to the manufacturer or producer of the physical �goods� that are
made available to the public (in this case the videotapes), Dastar was the
origin. If, however, �origin� includes the creator of the underlying work that
Dastar copied, then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of Dastar's
product. At bottom, we must decide what � 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act means
by the �origin� of �goods.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><span style='font-style:normal'>III</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The dictionary definition of �origin� is �[t]he
fact or process of coming into being from a source,� and �[t]hat from which
anything primarily proceeds; source.� Webster's New International Dictionary
1720&#8211;1721 (2d ed.1949). And the dictionary definition of �goods� (as
relevant here) is �[w]ares; merchandise.� <i>Id.,</i> at 1079. We think the
most natural understanding of the �origin� of �goods�&#8212;the source of
wares&#8212;is the producer of the tangible product sold in the marketplace, in
this case the physical Campaigns videotape sold by Dastar. The concept might be
stretched (as it was under the original version of � 43(a))<a href="#_ftn63"
name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[63]</span></span></span></a> to include not only the actual
producer, but also the trademark owner who commissioned or assumed
responsibility for (�stood behind�) production of the physical product. But as
used in the Lanham Act, the phrase �origin of goods� is in our view incapable
of connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas or communications
that �goods� embody or contain. Such an extension would not only stretch the
text, but it would be out of accord with the history and purpose of the Lanham
Act and inconsistent with precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits actions
like trademark infringement that deceive consumers and impair a producer's
goodwill. It forbids, for example, the Coca&#8211;Cola Company's passing off
its product as Pepsi&#8211;Cola or reverse passing off Pepsi&#8211;Cola as its
product. But the brand-loyal consumer who prefers the drink that the
Coca&#8211;Cola Company or PepsiCo sells, while he believes that that company
produced (or at least stands behind the production of) that product, surely
does not necessarily believe that that company was the �origin� of the drink in
the sense that it was the very first to devise the formula. The consumer who
buys a branded product does not automatically assume that the brand-name
company is the same entity that came up with the idea for the product, or
designed the product&#8212;and typically does not care whether it is. The words
of the Lanham Act should not be stretched to cover matters that are typically
of no consequence to purchasers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It could be argued, perhaps, that the reality of
purchaser concern is different for what might be called a communicative
product&#8212;one that is valued not primarily for its physical qualities, such
as a hammer, but for the intellectual content that it conveys, such as a book
or, as here, a video. The purchaser of a novel is interested not merely, if at
all, in the identity of the producer of the physical tome (the publisher), but
also, and indeed primarily, in the identity of the creator of the story it
conveys (the author). And the author, of course, has at least as much interest
in avoiding passing off (or reverse passing off) of his creation as does the
publisher. For such a communicative product (the argument goes) �origin of
goods� in � 43(a) must be deemed to include not merely the producer of the
physical item (the publishing house Farrar, Straus and Giroux, or the video
producer Dastar) but also the creator of the content that the physical item
conveys (the author Tom Wolfe, or&#8212;assertedly&#8212;respondents).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The problem with this argument according special
treatment to communicative products is that it causes the Lanham Act to
conflict with the law of copyright, which addresses that subject specifically.
The right to copy, and to copy without attribution, once a copyright has
expired, like �the right to make [an article whose patent has
expired]&#8212;including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried
when patented&#8212;passes to the public.� <i>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v.
Stiffel Co.,</i> 376 U.S. 225, 230 (1964); see also <i>Kellogg Co. v. National
Biscuit Co.,</i> 305 U.S. 111, 121&#8211;122 (1938). �In general, unless an
intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item, it
will be subject to copying.� <i>TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays,
Inc.,</i> 532 U.S. 23, 29 (2001). The rights of a patentee or copyright holder
are part of a �carefully crafted bargain,� <i>Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft
Boats, Inc.,</i> 489 U.S. 141, 150&#8211;151 (1989), under which, once the
patent or copyright monopoly has expired, the public may use the invention or
work at will and without attribution. Thus, in construing the Lanham Act, we
have been �careful to caution against misuse or over-extension� of trademark
and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by patent or
copyright. <i>TrafFix,</i> 532 U.S., at 29. �The Lanham Act,� we have said,
�does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a
particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of
exclusivity.� <i>Id.,</i> at 34. Federal trademark law �has no necessary
relation to invention or discovery,� <i>In re Trade&#8211;Mark Cases,</i> 100
U.S. 82, 94 (1879), but rather, by preventing competitors from copying �a
source-identifying mark,� �reduce[s] the customer's costs of shopping and
making purchasing decisions,� and �helps assure a producer that it (and not an
imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated
with a desirable product,� <i>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.,</i> 514
U.S. 159, 163&#8211;164 (1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Assuming for the sake of argument that Dastar's representation of itself as the
�Producer� of its videos amounted to a representation that it originated the
creative work conveyed by the videos, allowing a cause of action under � 43(a)
for that representation would create a species of mutant copyright law that
limits the public's �federal right to �copy and to use�� expired copyrights, <i>Bonito
Boats, supra,</i> at 165, 109 S.Ct. 971.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> When Congress has wished to create such an addition
to the law of copyright, it has done so with much more specificity than the
Lanham Act's ambiguous use of �origin.� The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990,
� 603(a), 104 Stat. 5128, provides that the author of an artistic work �shall
have the right ... to claim authorship of that work.� 17 U.S.C. �
106A(a)(1)(A). That express right of attribution is carefully limited and
focused: It attaches only to specified �work[s] of visual art,� � 101, is
personal to the artist, �� 106A(b) and (e), and endures only for �the life of
the author,� � 106A(d)(1). Recognizing in � 43(a) a cause of action for
misrepresentation of authorship of noncopyrighted works (visual or otherwise)
would render these limitations superfluous. A statutory interpretation that
renders another statute superfluous is of course to be avoided. <i>E.g., Mackey
v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Service, Inc.,</i> 486 U.S. 825, 837, and n.
11 (1988).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Reading �origin� in � 43(a) to require attribution
of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems. Without a
copyrighted work as the basepoint, the word �origin� has no discernable limits.
A video of the MGM film Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would
presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to Oscar Hammerstein II
(who wrote the musical on which the film was based), to Georges Bizet (who
wrote the opera on which the musical was based), and to Prosper Merimee (who
wrote the novel on which the opera was based). In many cases, figuring out who
is in the line of �origin� would be no simple task. Indeed, in the present case
it is far from clear that respondents have that status. Neither SFM nor New
Line had anything to do with the production of the Crusade television
series&#8212;they merely were licensed to distribute the video version. While Fox
might have a claim to being in the line of origin, its involvement with the
creation of the television series was limited at best. Time, Inc., was the
principal, if not the exclusive, creator, albeit under arrangement with Fox.
And of course it was neither Fox nor Time, Inc., that shot the film used in the
Crusade television series. Rather, that footage came from the United States
Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, the British Ministry of Information and War
Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified �Newsreel Pool
Cameramen.� If anyone has a claim to being the <i>original </i>creator of the
material used in both the Crusade television series and the Campaigns
videotapes, it would be those groups, rather than Fox. We do not think the
Lanham Act requires this search for the source of the Nile and all its
tributaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Another practical difficulty of adopting a special
definition of �origin� for communicative products is that it places the manufacturers
of those products in a difficult position. On the one hand, they would face
Lanham Act liability for <i>failing</i> to credit the creator of a work on
which their lawful copies are based; and on the other hand they could face
Lanham Act liability for <i>crediting</i> the creator if that should be
regarded as implying the creator's �sponsorship or approval� of the copy, 15
U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(A). In this case, for example, if Dastar had simply �copied
[the television series] as Crusade in Europe and sold it as Crusade in Europe,�
without changing the title or packaging (including the original credits to
Fox), it is hard to have confidence in respondents' assurance that they �would
not be here on a Lanham Act cause of action,� Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, reading � 43(a) of the Lanham Act as
creating a cause of action for, in effect, plagiarism&#8212;the use of
otherwise unprotected works and inventions without attribution&#8212;would be
hard to reconcile with our previous decisions. For example, in <i>Wal&#8211;Mart
Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 205 (2000), we considered
whether product-design trade dress can ever be inherently distinctive.
Wal&#8211;Mart produced �knockoffs� of children's clothes designed and manufactured
by Samara Brothers, containing only �minor modifications� of the original
designs. <i>Id.,</i> at 208. We concluded that the designs could not be
protected under � 43(a) without a showing that they had acquired �secondary
meaning,� <i>id.,</i> at 214, so that they ��identify the source of the product
rather than the product itself,� � <i>id.,</i> at 211 (quoting <i>Inwood
Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 851, n. 11
(1982)). This carefully considered limitation would be entirely pointless if the
�original� producer could turn around and pursue a reverse-passing-off claim
under exactly the same provision of the Lanham Act. Samara would merely have
had to argue that it was the �origin� of the designs that Wal&#8211;Mart was
selling as its own line. It was not, because �origin of goods� in the Lanham
Act referred to the producer of the clothes, and not the producer of the
(potentially) copyrightable or patentable designs that the clothes embodied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Similarly under respondents' theory, the �origin of
goods� provision of � 43(a) would have supported the suit that we rejected in <i>Bonito
Boats,</i> 489 U.S. 141, where the defendants had used molds to duplicate the
plaintiff's unpatented boat hulls (apparently without crediting the plaintiff).
And it would have supported the suit we rejected in <i>TrafFix,</i> 532 U.S.
23: The plaintiff, whose patents on flexible road signs had expired, and who
could not prevail on a trade-dress claim under � 43(a) because the features of
the signs were functional, would have had a reverse-passing-off claim for
unattributed copying of his design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, reading the phrase �origin of goods� in the
Lanham Act in accordance with the Act's common-law foundations (which were <i>not
</i>designed to protect originality or creativity), and in light of the
copyright and patent laws (which <i>were</i> ), we conclude that the phrase
refers to the producer of the tangible goods that are offered for sale, and not
to the author of any idea, concept, or communication embodied in those goods.
Cf. 17 U.S.C. � 202 (distinguishing between a copyrighted work and �any
material object in which the work is embodied�). To hold otherwise would be
akin to finding that � 43(a) created a species of perpetual patent and
copyright, which Congress may not do. See <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft,</i> 537 U.S.
186, 208 (2003).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The creative talent of the sort that lay behind the
Campaigns videos is not left without protection. The original film footage used
in the Crusade television series could have been copyrighted, see 17 U.S.C. �
102(a)(6), as was copyrighted (as a compilation) the Crusade television series,
even though it included material from the public domain, see � 103(a). Had Fox
renewed the copyright in the Crusade television series, it would have had an
easy claim of copyright infringement. And respondents' contention that
Campaigns infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower's book is still
a live question on remand. If, moreover, the producer of a video that
substantially copied the Crusade series were, in advertising or promotion, to
give purchasers the impression that the video was quite different from that
series, then one or more of the respondents might have a cause of
action&#8212;not for reverse passing off under the �confusion ... as to the
origin� provision of � 43(a)(1)(A), but for misrepresentation under the
�misrepresents the nature, characteristics [or] qualities� provision of �
43(a)(1)(B). For merely saying it is the producer of the video, however, no
Lanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span

the products it sold as its own, respondents cannot prevail on their Lanham Act
claim. We thus have no occasion to consider whether the Lanham Act permitted an
award of double petitioner's profits. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.</p>

reverse passing off of �any idea, concept, or communication�</i>.&nbsp; In the
wake of <i>Dastar</i>, courts have uniformly held that the �origin of goods�
provision of Lanham Act � 43(a) cannot prevent the unattributed use of someone
else�s ideas or expression.&nbsp; Consider, for example, <i>LaPine v. Seinfeld</i>,

Lapine, a trained chef, wrote a cook book entitled <i>The Sneaky Chef: Simple
Strategies for Hiding Healthy Food in Kids' Favorite Meals</i>, which was published
in April 2007 to mild success.&nbsp; The defendant Jessica Seinfeld, wife of
Jerry Seinfeld, subsequently authored&#8212;or was credited as the author
of&#8212;the book <i>Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids
Eating Good Food</i>, which was published in October 2007 and reached number

repackaging of plaintiff's material as its own. <i>Id.</i> at 31 (the claim
�would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought some of New Line's Crusade

Life Sciences Inc. v. Iovate Health Sciences Research Inc.,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d
270, 285 (S.D.N.Y.2007). Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants took

does not foreclose that claim. This argument is unavailing. Plaintiffs' Lanham
Act unfair competition claim is, at its core, the same as Plaintiffs' copyright
claim&#8212;that Defendants took Plaintiff Lapine's ideas and used them in <i>Deceptively

the source of the ideas and the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4in;margin-bottom:0in;

preparing <i>Deceptively Delicious</i> and that, consequently, Seinfeld's
statements that <i>Deceptively Delicious</i> is the product of her own work and
Defendants' claim of a copyright in that work constitute falsities because they
�assign the entire credit for [<i>Deceptively Delicious</i> ] and Lapine's
property contained therein, to themselves, and fail to credit Lapine or her
Book.� (Compl.�� 73&#8211;75.) Plaintiffs assert that the alleged
misrepresentations that are likely to cause confusion or deception <i>�as to

the type of claim that is precluded by <i>Dastar,</i> and the Court finds
persuasive those decisions holding that �a failure to attribute authorship to
Plaintiff does not amount to misrepresentation of the nature, characteristics,

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dastar <i>and
products other than �communicative products�</i>.&nbsp; Courts have similarly
held that short of the mere �repackaging� of another�s products as one�s own,
the �origin of goods� provision of Lanham Act � 43(a) will not prevent the
unattributed use of someone else�s products as components in one�s own
products.&nbsp; Consider, for example, <i>Bretford Mfg., Inc. v. Smith System
Mfg. Corp</i>., 419 F.3d 576 (7th Cir. 2005).&nbsp; The plaintiff and defendant
were competing table manufacturers.&nbsp; When one of its suppliers failed to produce
satisfactory parts, the defendant incorporated some of the plaintiff�s hardware
in its sample table that it showed to purchasing officials from a school
district, who placed an order.&nbsp; The tables the defendant ultimately
delivered to the school district contained none of the plaintiff�s
hardware.&nbsp; Judge Easterbrook held for the defendant: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.4in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Passing off or palming off occurs when
a firm puts someone else's trademark on its own (usually inferior) goods;
reverse passing off or misappropriation is selling someone else's goods under
your own mark. See <i>Roho, Inc. v. Marquis,</i> 902 F.2d 356, 359 (5th
Cir.1990). It is not clear what's wrong with reselling someone else's goods, if
you first buy them at retail. If every automobile sold by DeLorean includes the
chassis and engine of a Peugeot, with DeLorean supplying only the body shell,
Peugeot has received its asking price for each car sold and does not suffer any
harm. Still, the Supreme Court said in <i>Dastar</i> that �reverse passing off�
can violate the Lanham Act if a misdescription of goods' origin causes
commercial injury. Our opinion in <i>Peaceable Planet, Inc. v. Ty, Inc.,</i>
362 F.3d 986 (7th Cir.2004), shows how this could occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.4in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Dastar</i> added that the injury
must be a <i>trademark</i> loss&#8212;which is to say, it must come from a
misrepresentation of the goods' origin. Dastar thus had the right (so far as
the Lanham Act is concerned) to incorporate into its videos footage taken and
edited by others, provided that it manufactured the finished product and did
not mislead anyone about who should be held responsible for shortcomings. No
one makes a product from scratch, with trees and iron ore entering one end of
the plant and a finished consumer product emerging at the other. Ford's cars
include Fram oil filters, Goodyear tires, Owens-Corning glass, Bose radios,
Pennzoil lubricants, and many other constituents; buyers can see some of the
other producers' marks (those on the radio and tires for example) but not
others, such as the oil and transmission fluid. Smith System builds tables
using wood from one supplier, grommets (including Teflon from du Pont) from
another, and vinyl molding and paint and bolts from any of a hundred more
sources&#8212;the list is extensive even for a simple product such as a table.
If Smith System does not tell du Pont how the Teflon is used, and does not
inform its consumers which firm supplied the wood, has it violated the Lanham
Act? Surely not; the statute does not condemn the way in which all products are
made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.4in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Legs are a larger fraction of a table's
total value than grommets and screws, but nothing in the statute establishes
one rule for �major� components and another for less costly inputs. The right
question, <i>Dastar</i> holds, is whether the consumer knows who has produced
the finished product. In the <i>Dastar</i> case that was Dastar itself, even
though most of the product's economic value came from elsewhere; just so when
Smith System includes components manufactured by others but stands behind the
finished product. The portion of � 43(a) that addresses reverse passing off is
the one that condemns false designations of origin. �Origin� means, <i>Dastar</i>
holds, �the producer of the tangible product sold in the marketplace�. 539 U.S.
at 31. As far as Dallas was concerned, the table's �origin� was Smith System,
no matter who made any component or subassembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.4in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Much of Bretford's argument takes the
form that it is just �unfair� for Smith System to proceed as it did, making a
sale before its subcontractor could turn out acceptable leg assemblies.
Businesses often think competition unfair, but federal law encourages wholesale
copying, the better to drive down prices. Consumers rather than producers are
the objects of the law's solicitude. If Smith System misled Dallas into
thinking that it could supply high-quality tables, when its subcontractor could
not match Bretford's welds and other attributes of Bretford's V-shaped leg
assemblies, then the victim would be the Dallas school system. (As far as we
are aware, however, Dallas is happy with the quality of the tables it received;
it has not complained about a bait and switch.) As the Court observed in <i>Dastar,</i>
creators of certain artistic works are entitled (along the lines of the
European approach to moral rights) to control how their work is presented or
altered by others. See 539 U.S. at 34-35, citing 17 U.S.C. � 106A. See also <i>Lee
v. A.R.T. Co.,</i> 125 F.3d 580 (7th Cir.1997). Bretford's table is not a �work
of visual art� under � 106A (and the definition in 17 U.S.C. � 101). Once
Bretford sold its goods, it had no control over how customers used their
components: the Lanham Act does not include any version of the �derivative
work� right in copyright law. See 17 U.S.C. � 106(2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the ex parte examination of a trademark
application, a refusal under �2(d) is normally based on the examining
attorney�s conclusion that the applicant�s mark, as used on or in connection
with the specified goods or services, so resembles a <i>registered</i> mark as
to be likely to cause confusion.&nbsp; See TMEP �1207.02 concerning application
of the �2(d) provision relating to marks that so resemble another mark as to be
likely to deceive, and TMEP �1207.03 concerning �2(d) refusals based on
unregistered marks (which generally are not issued in ex parte examination).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The examining attorney must conduct a search of
USPTO records to determine whether the applicant�s mark so resembles any
registered mark(s) as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake, when used on
or in connection with the goods or services identified in the application. The
examining attorney also searches pending applications for conflicting marks
with earlier effective filing dates�.&nbsp; The examining attorney must place a
copy of the search strategy in the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If the examining attorney determines that there is
a likelihood of confusion between applicant�s mark and a previously registered
mark or marks, the examining attorney refuses registration of the applicant�s
mark under �2(d). Before citing a registration, the examining attorney must
check the automated records of the USPTO to confirm that any registration that
is the basis for a �2(d) refusal is an active registration�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As should be clear from the foregoing, there is no
mechanical test for determining likelihood of confusion and �each case must be
decided on its own facts.� <i>Du Pont</i>, 476 F.2d at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567.
In some cases, a determination that there is no likelihood of confusion may be
appropriate, even where the marks are similar and the goods/services are
related, because these factors are outweighed by other factors, such as
differences in the relevant trade channels of the goods/services, the presence
in the marketplace of a significant number of similar marks in use on similar
goods/services, the existence of a valid consent agreement between the parties,
or another established fact probative of the effect of use. For example, in <i>In
re Strategic Partners, Inc.</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1397 (TTAB 2012), the Board
reversed a refusal to register the mark ANYWEAR (in stylized text), for
�footwear,� finding no likelihood of confusion with the registered mark ANYWEAR
BY JOSIE NATORI (and design), for �jackets, shirts, pants, stretch T-tops and
stoles.� Given the similarity in the marks and the relatedness of the goods,
the Board stated that �under usual circumstances� it would conclude that
confusion is likely to occur; however, an �unusual situation� compelled the
Board �to balance the similarities between the marks and goods against the
facts that applicant already owns a registration for a substantially similar
mark for the identical goods, and that applicant�s registration and the cited registration
have coexisted for over five years.� <i>Id</i>. at 1399. Applicant�s prior
registration of ANYWEARS for goods including footwear was substantially similar
to the applied-for mark ANYWEAR for the same goods, and the registration had
achieved incontestable status. <i>Id.</i> Basing its decision on the thirteenth
<i>du Pont</i> factor, which �relates to �any other established fact probative
of the effect of use,�� the Board determined that this factor outweighed the
others and confusion was unlikely. <i>Id</i>. at 1399-1400 (quoting <i>du Pont</i>,
476 F.2d at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The decision in <i>Strategic Partners</i> may be
applied and weighed against a �2(d) refusal in the limited situation where: (1)
an applicant owns a prior registration for the same mark or a mark with no
meaningful difference from the applied-for-mark; (2) the identifications of
goods/services in the application and applicant�s prior registration are
identical or identical in relevant part; and (3) the applicant�s prior
registration has co-existed for at least five years with the registration being
considered as the basis for the Section 2(d) refusal. See <i>Id</i>. at 1400. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

�2(d) in an intent-to-use application under �1(b) of the Trademark Act does not
differ from the determination in any other type of application.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><b>1207.03&nbsp;&nbsp; Marks Previously Used in United
States but Not Registered</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a basis for refusal, �2(d) refers not only to registered
marks but also to �a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by
another and not abandoned.� Refusal on the basis of an unregistered mark or
trade name has sometimes been referred to as refusal on the basis of a �known
mark.� This provision is not applied in ex parte examination because of the
practical difficulties with which an examining attorney is faced in locating
�previously used� marks, and determining whether anyone has rights in them and
whether they are �not abandoned.�</p>

provides protection for trademarks against �dilution,� which is probably the
single most muddled concept in all of trademark doctrine.&nbsp; Of the many
reasons for this, perhaps the most significant&#8212;and avoidable&#8212;is
that trademark courts and commentators tend to speak of several different
species of trademark dilution without identifying them any more specifically
than by the generic name �dilution.�&nbsp; From the very beginning of your study
of dilution, it may be worthwhile to distinguish among three specific species
of dilution: (1) dilution of uniqueness, (2) dilution by �blurring,� and (3) dilution
by �tarnishment.�&nbsp; Because dilution is so easily misunderstood, each form
of dilution is briefly discussed below before we turn to the representative
case law.&nbsp; Note that, strictly speaking, U.S. trademark law protects
against only dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment.&nbsp; A brief
description of dilution of a trademark�s uniqueness is offered because it is
arguably what the trademark practitioner and scholar Frank Schechter had in
mind when he first originated the concept of trademark dilution in the 1920s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Dilution of Uniqueness</i>.&nbsp; In his seminal 1927
article<i> The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection</i>, 40 <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Harv. L. Rev</span>. 813 (1927), Schechter
introduced to American law the concept of trademark dilution.&nbsp; By
�dilution,� Schechter arguably meant to refer to the impairment of a
trademark�s <i>uniqueness</i>,<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[66]</span></span></span></a>
or what modern marketing doctrine would term its �brand differentiation.� &nbsp;His
primary concern was to preserve what he variously termed a mark�s �arresting
uniqueness,� its �singularity,� �identity,� and �individuality,� its quality of
being �unique and different from other marks.�&nbsp; Schechter was not so much
concerned with a trademark�s distinctiveness <i>of source</i>, but with a
trademark�s distinctiveness <i>from other marks</i>, not its �source
distinctiveness,� but its �differential distinctiveness.�<a href="#_ftn67"
name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[67]</span></span></span></a> In Schechter�s view,
trademark uniqueness was worth protecting because it generated �selling
power.�&nbsp; Certain very strong marks were not simply a means of identifying
and advertising source.&nbsp; In a new age of mass production, they were also a
means of endowing the goods to which they were attached with the characteristic
of uniqueness as against the crowds of other mass-produced goods in the
marketplace, a characteristic for which consumers would pay a premium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Schechter believed, quite rightly at the time, that
antidilution protection was necessary because anti-infringement protection,
based on consumer confusion as to source, would not fully preserve the
uniqueness of famous marks.&nbsp; In situations where a defendant used a famous
mark on goods unrelated to those on which the famous mark normally appeared
(e.g., <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>kodak</span> pianos, <span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>rolls royce</span> chewing gum), consumers
would not likely assume that the defendant�s product had the plaintiff as its
source.&nbsp; Thus, no cause of action for consumer confusion as to source
would lie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The beauty of Schechter�s original conception of
antidilution protection was that it was relatively easy to put into
practice.&nbsp; Uniqueness is an absolute concept.&nbsp; A mark is either
unique or it is not.&nbsp; If a senior mark is unique in the marketplace and a
junior mark appears that is identical to it, then the junior mark will destroy
the senior mark�s uniqueness.&nbsp; Thus, the test for dilution was an
essentially formal one.&nbsp; The judge need only consider the identity or
close similarity of the parties� marks.&nbsp; If they were identical or closely-similar,
then the loss of uniqueness could be presumed.&nbsp; <i>See</i> <i>Eli Lilly
&amp; Co. v. Natural Answers, Inc</i>. 233 F.3d 456, 468-69 (7th Cir. 2000)
(considering only similarity of the parties� marks and the �renown� of the
senior mark in finding a likelihood of dilution); <i>Ringling Bros-Barnum &amp;
Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Division of Travel Development</i>, 170
F.3d 449, 464 (4th Cir. 1999) (�[O]nly mark similarity and, possibly, degree of
�renown� of the senior mark would appear to have trustworthy relevance under
the federal Act.�).&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the consumer confusion test was a messy
and unpredictable empirical analysis centered on the <i>consumer</i>, the
trademark dilution test was a simple and relatively predictable analysis
centered on the <i>trademark</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that Schechter�s original conception has never been
enacted into law,&nbsp; and the language of Lanham Act � 43(c) is careful to
steer clear of it.&nbsp; Indeed, in the early stages of the drafting of the
Act, a form of antidilution protection based on �uniqueness� was proposed and
rejected.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[68]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Dilution by Blurring</i>.&nbsp; The idea underlying the
concept of trademark �blurring� is that the defendant�s use of a mark similar
or identical to the plaintiff�s mark, though perhaps not confusing as to
source, will nevertheless �blur� the link between the plaintiff�s mark and the
goods or services to which the plaintiff�s mark is traditionally attached. &nbsp;In
modern marketing parlance, anti-blurring protection seeks to preserve a brand�s
�typicality,� the brand�s �ability to conjure up a particular product category.�
&nbsp;Alexander F. Simonson, <i>How and When Do Trademarks Dilute: A Behavioral
Framework to Judge �Likelihood of Dilution</i>�, 83 <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Trademark Rep.</span> 149, 152-53 (1993).&nbsp; In <i>Ty Inc. v.
Perryman</i>, 306 F.3d 509 (7th Cir. 2002), Judge Posner provides a
hypothetical example of blurring:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[T]here is concern that consumer search costs will rise if
a trademark becomes associated with a variety of unrelated products. Suppose an
upscale restaurant calls itself �Tiffany.� There is little danger that the
consuming public will think it's dealing with a branch of the Tiffany jewelry
store if it patronizes this restaurant. But when consumers next see the name
�Tiffany� they may think about both the restaurant and the jewelry store, and
if so the efficacy of the name as an identifier of the store will be
diminished. Consumers will have to think harder&#8212;incur as it were a higher
imagination cost&#8212;to recognize the name as the name of the store.&nbsp; So
�blurring� is one form of dilution.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 511 (citations omitted).&nbsp; As Judge
Posner�s description suggests, the increase in �imagination cost� that blurring
is thought to cause forms the basis of the economic defense of antidilution
protection.&nbsp; As then Professor Posner explained, �[a] trademark seeks to
economize on information costs by providing a compact, memorable and
unambiguous identifier of a product or service.&nbsp; The economy is less when,
because the trademark has other associations, a person seeing it must think for
a moment before recognizing it as the mark of the product or service.� Richard
Posner, <i>When Is Parody Fair Use?</i>, 21 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>J.
Legal Studies</span> 67, 75 (1992).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The beauty of the blurring theory of dilution is that it is
emphatically empirical in orientation.&nbsp; For the judge to find that a
junior mark �blurs� a senior mark, the judge must find that the junior mark is
causing consumers to �think for a moment� before recognizing that the senior
mark refers to the goods of the senior mark�s owner.&nbsp; A merely formal
analysis of the similarity of the marks is insufficient.&nbsp; The judge must
evaluate the effect of the junior mark on the perceptions of actual consumers
and must in the process take into account such factors as the degree of
distinctiveness&#8212;or typicality&#8212;of the senior mark and the
sophistication of the relevant consumer population.&nbsp; The analysis is once
again centered on the <i>consumer</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Dilution by Tarnishment</i>.&nbsp; Dilution by
tarnishment is fundamentally different from dilution by blurring (and arguably
has nothing to do with �dilution� as Schechter originally formulated the
concept).&nbsp; Tarnishment describes damage to the positive associations or
connotations of a trademark.&nbsp; <i>See Deere &amp; Co. v. MTD Prods., Inc</i>.,
41 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir. 1994) (��Tarnishment� generally arises when the
plaintiff's trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed
in an unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke unflattering thoughts
about the owner's product[s].�).&nbsp; In, for example, <i>New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. v. New York, New York Hotel, LLC</i>, 293 F.3d 550 (2d Cir.
2002), a Las Vegas casino called its players club the �New York $lot
Exchange.�&nbsp; Owners of the <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>new york
stock exchange</span> trademark took offense at the suggestion that there stock
exchange was in some sense a venue for gambling, if not also for stacked odds,
and sued. The Second Circuit reversed the district court�s grant of summary
judgment to the casino on the ground that the casino�s use �would injure NYSE�s
reputation.�&nbsp; <i>Id</i>. at 558 (analyzing the issue under New York state
anti-tarnishment law).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i>Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC</i>,
507 F.3d 252 (4th Cir. 2007), the Fourth Circuit set forth the main elements of
a claim for dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment.&nbsp; The
plaintiff must show:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) that the plaintiff owns a famous mark that is
distinctive;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) that the defendant has commenced using a mark in
commerce that allegedly is diluting the famous mark;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) that a similarity between the defendant's mark and the
famous mark gives rise to an association between the marks; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(4) that the association is likely to impair the
distinctiveness of the famous mark or likely to harm the reputation of the
famous mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 264-65.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In light of the above, the statutory language of � 43(c)
excerpted below will reward a close reading.&nbsp; We then turn first to anti-blurring
protection and then to anti-tarnishment protection.<a href="#_ftn69"

<p class=OpinionCitation>Lanham Act � 43(c), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(c) Dilution by blurring; dilution by tarnishment</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) Injunctive relief. Subject to the principles of equity,
the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or through acquired
distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who,
at any time after the owner�s mark has become famous, commences use of a mark
or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or
dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or
absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic
injury.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(2) Definitions</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(A) For purposes of paragraph (1),
a mark is famous if it is widely recognized by the general consuming public of
the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the
mark�s owner. In determining whether a mark possesses the requisite degree of
recognition, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the
following:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(i) The duration, extent, and
geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark, whether advertised
or publicized by the owner or third parties.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(ii) The amount, volume, and
geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:.3in'>(iii) The extent
of actual recognition of the mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:.3in'>(iv) Whether the
mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20,
1905, or on the principal register.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(B) For purposes of paragraph (1),
�dilution by blurring� is association arising from the similarity between a
mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the
famous mark. In determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to cause
dilution by blurring, the court may consider all relevant factors, including
the following:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(i) The degree of similarity
between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(ii) The degree of inherent or
acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(iii) The extent to which the
owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the
mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:.3in'>(iv) The degree
of recognition of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:.3in'>(v) Whether the
user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the
famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(vi) Any actual association
between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(C) For purposes of paragraph (1),
�dilution by tarnishment� is association arising from the similarity between a
mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous
mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(3) Exclusions. The following shall not be actionable as
dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under this subsection:</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'>(A) Any fair use, including a
nominative or descriptive fair use, or facilitation of such fair use, of a
famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the
person�s own goods or services, including use in connection with&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(i) advertising or promotion that
permits consumers to compare goods or services; or</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.9in'>(ii) identifying and parodying,
criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services
of the famous mark owner.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(B) All forms of news reporting
and news commentary.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(C) Any noncommercial use of a
mark.</p>

conclusions of law issue as a result of a bench trial conducted in this
trademark action. Plaintiff Nike, Inc. (�Nike�), a company headquartered in
Beaverton, Oregon which uses the mark NIKE, contests the use of the mark
NIKEPAL by Defendant Nikepal International, Inc. (�Nikepal�), a company located
in Sacramento, California. Nike initially contested Nikepal's registration of
the NIKEPAL mark at the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (�TTAB�) of the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (�PTO�); however, the TTAB denied Nike's
opposition to Nikepal's registration of the NIKEPAL mark. Nike subsequently
appealed the TTAB's ruling to this court under 15 U.S.C. � 1071 and brought
additional claims for federal and state trademark dilution under 15 U.S.C. �
1125(c) and California Business and Professions Code section 14330; for

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>Findings of Fact</p>

<p class=Centered>I. The Parties and their Businesses</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. Nike</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nike was incorporated in 1968 under the original
company name Blue Ribbon Sports. In 1971, it adopted the NIKE mark to brand its
footwear products and in May 1978, the company's name was officially changed to
�Nike, Inc.� Today, Nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel
in the world. Nike sells around 180 million pairs of shoes annually in the
United States alone. Nike's principal business activity is the design,
development, and worldwide marketing and distribution of high quality and
technologically advanced footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories. Nike
has continuously used the NIKE mark on and in connection with the various
products offered by the company since the 1970s. Sometimes, the word mark NIKE
is the only brand used; sometimes, Nike's Swoosh design mark (i.e. the logo
which frequently appears on products along with NIKE, and in some instances
alone) is also placed on the product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. Nikepal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nikepal was incorporated on May 18, 1998 by the
company's founder and president, Palminder Sandhu (�Mr.Sandhu�), who then began
using the NIKEPAL mark in commerce. Nikepal provides services and products to
analytical, environmental, and scientific laboratories. Nikepal's trademark
application to the PTO requested registration for: �import and export agencies
and wholesale distributorships featuring scientific, chemical, pharmaceutical,
biotechnology testing instruments and glassware for laboratory use, electrical
instruments, paper products and household products and cooking appliances.�
(Application Serial No. 76123346, filed September 6, 2000) Nikepal distributes
glass syringes in varying volumes and other laboratory products to testing and
power companies and also distributes paper boxes (syringe carrying cases) and
nylon valves and caps for use with the syringes. Nikepal only distributes its
products to laboratories, not to individuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nikepal does not have a retail office, but operates
its business through its website (located at www.nikepal.com), via email, and
via telephone. Nikepal is run by Mr. Sandhu, who also works as a transportation
engineer. Currently, Nikepal has one other part-time employee. Nikepal has only
a few hundred customers, but it has a list of thousands of prospective
customers, some of whom receive materials from Nikepal advertising its product
and service offerings under the mark NIKEPAL.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II. The Parties' Marks</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. NIKE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nike first registered the NIKE mark with the PTO in
February 1974. Nike owns ten federal trademark registrations for the NIKE mark
alone, covering footwear, clothing, bags, timepieces, paper products such as
notebooks and binders, sport balls, swim accessories, and retail store
services, all of which related to pre-May 1998 uses of the mark. By May 1998,
Nike was also using and applied for trademark registrations covering the use of
the NIKE mark in combination with other terms or designs for footwear, clothing,
bags, timepieces, posters, sport balls, swim accessories, weights, gloves,
headgear, and retail store services. For example, Nike owns nineteen federal
registrations for NIKE composite marks such as: NIKE and the Swoosh design
which has been in use since 1971; NIKE AIR which has been in use since 1987;
NIKE-FIT which has been in use since 1990; NIKE TOWN which has been in use
since 1990; NIKE SHOP which has been in use since 1991; and NIKE GOLF which has
been in use since 1993. From 1998 to the present, Nike has continued to use the
mark NIKE alone and in combination with other terms or designs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. NIKEPAL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Sandhu testified that he conceived of the term
Nikepal when he wanted to create a vanity license plate for his car. He
testified that he selected the word �Nike� by opening a dictionary to a random
page and choosing the first word he saw, and then combined it with the first
three letters of his first name �Pal.� �Pal� means friend or benefactor. Mr.
Sandhu admits he knew of the existence of the company Nike and its use of the
NIKE mark at the time he devised the term NIKEPAL. Despite Mr. Sandhu's trial
testimony concerning the manner in which he conceived of the term NIKEPAL, the
court does not find it to be credible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The �Nike� portion of the NIKEPAL mark is
pronounced the same way as the NIKE mark is pronounced: with a hard �i� (like
bike) in the first syllable and a hard �e� (like in �key�) in the second
syllable.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[71]</span></span></span></a>
The articles of incorporation signed by Mr. Sandhu for Nikepal in 1998 display
the company name as �NikePal International, Inc.,� with the first word of the
company name spelled �NikePal,� with a capital �N� and a capital �P.�<a
href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[72]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition to using Nikepal as the company name,
NIKEPAL appears directly on some of Nikepal's products, including on its
syringe products, and on its marketing materials. Nikepal also places
www.nikepal.com on its syringes to identify the source of the syringe. Nikepal
also uses the NIKEPAL mark in a vanity phone number (1-877-N-I-K-E-P-A-L), on
its website, and in its domain names, including nikepal.com, nikepal.biz,
nikepal.us, nikepal.tv, nikepal.info, and nikepal.net.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III. Nike's Sales</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> By the late 1980s, United States sales of NIKE
branded products were over one billion dollars per year. Starting in 1991 and
through the mid 1990s, sales of NIKE products in the United States were
approximately two billion dollars per year, and were above five billion dollars
per year by 1997. By 1997, Nike was the largest seller of athletic footwear and
apparel in the world. The geographic area of Nike's sales includes the United
States and 140 countries throughout the world. Since 1997, Nike has sold over
100,000,000 pairs of NIKE shoes each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>IV. Advertising and Promotion of the NIKE Mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nike has undertaken significant expense to promote
the NIKE mark. Nike advertises in various types of media, including traditional
print advertising, such as magazines (of both special and general interest),
newspapers (of general circulation), leaflets, and billboards. Nike also
advertises in electronic media, including radio, television, cable and
internet, on sides of buildings, on taxi cabs, and through direct mailings.
Nike's television advertisements have run on network channels and have reached
national audiences. Nike has also promoted its mark by associating with
athletes through endorsement arrangements. By 1991, Nike was spending in excess
of one hundred million dollars per year in the United States alone to advertise
products bearing the NIKE mark. By 1997, Nike had spent at least
$1,567,900,000.00 to promote the NIKE mark in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>V. Notoriety of NIKE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The NIKE mark has been consistently ranked as a top
brand in publications that survey the top brands each year. Since at least
1990, Nike has been named one of the top forty brands in the United States
based on the EquiTrend and other studies published in BrandWeek and Financial
World Magazine. Other brands ranked in such studies include FRITO LAY, LEVI'S,
CAMPBELLS', HEWLETT-PACKARD, SONY, PEPSI, and VISA. One story printed in Forbes
magazine, reported a survey conducted by Young &amp; Rubicam that ranked the
NIKE brand among the top ten in the United States in 1996 with COKE, DISNEY,
and HALLMARK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>VI. Evidence of Actual Association</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A survey conducted by Phillip Johnson of Leo J.
Shapiro and Associates (�Mr. Johnson's survey�), a Chicago-based market
research firm, determined that a significant number of Nikepal's potential
laboratory customers actually associated NIKE with NIKEPAL. Mr. Johnson is an
expert at designing surveys that measure consumer behavior. The primary
business of Shapiro and Associates is to explore consumer behavior through the
use of surveys for businesses such as Toys-R-Us, Target, and Petsmart in order
to help them better understand their marketplace when developing new retail
concepts. Nike retained Mr. Johnson to design a survey to measure, <i>inter
alia,</i> the likelihood of dilution of the NIKE brand as a result of Nikepal's
use of the NIKEPAL mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In designing his study, Mr. Johnson used a universe
of survey participants randomly selected from lists of companies that Mr.
Sandhu's deposition testimony identified as the sources for Nikepal's current
and prospective customers. Mr. Johnson conducted the survey by phone and asked
respondents about their perception of a website called nikepal.com. In
designing his survey, Mr. Johnson chose one of the ways that the NIKEPAL mark
is used in commerce which allowed him to reasonably recreate a purchasing
context while obtaining a controlled and accurate measurement. Mr. Johnson
testified that this survey replicated the circumstances in which people
typically encountered the NIKEPAL mark. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Once survey respondents were screened to confirm
that they were the persons most responsible for ordering laboratory equipment
at their business, they were asked: �What if anything, came to your mind when I
first said the word Nikepal?� Many survey respondents who were not actually
confused about the source of the Nikepal website nonetheless identified Nike.
Mr. Johnson testified that his survey revealed that the vast majority of
respondents, 87%, associated Nikepal with Nike; that is, when they encounter
the mark NIKEPAL, they think of Nike and/or its offerings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Evidence of actual association of the NIKEPAL mark
with the NIKE mark also exists beyond the results demonstrated in Mr. Johnson's
survey. Mr. Sandhu registered the domain names nikepal.biz, nikepal.us,
nikepal.tv, nikepal.net, and nikepal.info with Network Solution, and until just
prior to trial, those websites were inactive. Mr. Sandhu testified that at the
time he registered those domains he chose not to link them to an active
website. As a result, Network Solutions assigned those domains an �under
construction� page and then associated with that page promotions and
advertisement links to product and service offerings of its choice. These
promotions and advertisements all referred to NIKE products or those of one of
its competitors. Thus, when accessing Nikepal's NIKEPAL domain names (other
than nikepal.com), users received information about Nike or its competitors,
but not Nikepal.</p>

<p class=Centered>Conclusions of Law</p>

<p class=Centered>I. Dilution</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under the Federal Trademark Dilution Revision Act<a
href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[73]</span></span></span></a>:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>&nbsp;[T]he owner of a famous mark that is distinctive,
inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an
injunction against another person who, at any time after the owner's mark has
become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely
to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark,
regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of
competition, or of actual economic injury.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1) (�TDRA�). To prevail on its
dilution claim, Nike must prove 1) that its mark was famous as of a date prior
to the first use of the NIKEPAL mark and 2) that Nikepal's use of its allegedly
diluting mark creates a likelihood of dilution by blurring or tarnishment.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> If Nike prevails on its federal dilution claim, it
will also prevail on its dilution claim under California law. <i>See Jada Toys,
Inc. v. Mattel, Inc.,</i> 496 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. Aug.2, 2007); <i>see also
Panavision Int'l v. Toeppen,</i> 141 F.3d 1316, 1324 (9th Cir.1998) (
�[Plaintiff's] state law dilution claim [under California Business and
Professions Code section 14330] is subject to the same analysis as its federal
[dilution] claim.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. Whether NIKE Was Famous Prior to the First Use of
NIKEPAL</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A �famous� mark is one that �is widely recognized
by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source
of the goods or services of the mark's owner.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2)(A).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In determining whether a mark possesses the
requisite degree of recognition, the court may consider all relevant factors,
including the following:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of
advertising and publicity of the mark, whether advertised or publicized by the
owner or third parties.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of
goods or services offered under the mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March
3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> Since Nikepal's first use of NIKEPAL commenced
in May 1998, Nike must show that NIKE was famous before that date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to the first factor, the evidence
clearly establishes that through various combinations of athlete endorsements,
television, radio, print media, and billboard placements, NIKE was promoted
nationally for more than two decades before 1998. By the 1990s, Nike was had
spent in excess of a billion dollars for promotion of NIKE products in the
United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to the second factor, Nike's sales of
NIKE products reached the billion dollar per year level in the United States
well before May 1998. By 1997, Nike had spent in excess of one billion dollars to
promote the NIKE mark in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nike also satisfies the third factor, since
recognition of the success of NIKE has been recorded by various publications in
surveys and articles written prior to May 1998. Since the early 1990s, NIKE has
been consistently ranked as a top brand in brand surveys in the United States
and the world. Mr. Johnson, who in his professional capacity is familiar with
the reputation and methodology used in various brand surveys and literature,
opined that these sources evinced that NIKE was famous during the mid 1990s,
before Nikepal adopted its mark in 1998. Nikepal counters that only Nike's
Swoosh design mark, and not the NIKE mark itself, is famous. However, Mr.
Johnson's survey revealed that when participants were exposed solely to the
word �Nike� without the Swoosh, the response overwhelmingly indicated
recognition of the NIKE mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, with regard to the fourth factor, the NIKE
mark is registered on the PTO's principal register. Nike owns ten federal
registrations for NIKE covering uses prior to 1998 which include retail
services, bags, footwear, apparel, heart monitors, electrical items and paper
products. Accordingly, the court concludes that NIKE was famous under 15 U.S.C.
� 1125(c)(2)(A), prior to Nikepal's first use of the NIKEPAL mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. Likelihood of Dilution by Blurring</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The TDRA defines dilution by blurring as an
�association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a
famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.� 15 U.S.C. �
1125(c)(2)(A).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to
cause dilution by blurring, the court may consider all relevant factors,
including the following:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name
and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of
the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is
engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to
create an association with the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name
and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Id.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>(i) The Degree of Similarity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Marks in a dilution analysis must be �identical� or
�nearly identical.�<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[75]</span></span></span></a>
<i>Thane Int'l, Inc. v. Trek Bicycle Corp.,</i> 305 F.3d 894, 906 (9th
Cir.2002). �For marks to be nearly identical to one another, they �must be
similar enough that a significant segment of the target group of customers sees
the two marks as essentially the same.� � <i>Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Welles,</i>
279 F.3d 796, 806 n. 41 (9th Cir.2002) (internal citation omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The parties' marks are nearly identical. The
NIKEPAL mark is a composite of the word �Nike� with the term of affinity,
�pal.� The composite nature of the NIKEPAL mark is evident in the logo selected
by the company which clearly features an �N� and a �P.� In each case the
dominant feature of the mark is the term �Nike.� In addition, the term �Nike�
in both marks is pronounced identically with an �i� like in �bike� and an �e�
like in �key.� <i>See Porsche Cars N. Am., Inc.,</i> 2000 WL 641209, at *3,
(finding that the trademark PORSCHE was diluted by PORCHESOURCE.COM); <i>see
also Jada Toys, Inc.,</i> 496 F.3d 974, 2007 WL 2199286, at *4 (concluding
�that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the HOT WHEELS and HOT RIGZ
marks are nearly identical.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Further, as shown by Mr. Johnson's survey, the vast
majority of the survey respondents, representing a significant segment of
Nikepal's target customer group, associate Nike and/or its products and
services when they encounter the mark NIKEPAL, thus perceiving the two marks as
essentially the same. <i>See Thane Int'l, Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 906 (�The marks
must be of sufficient similarity so that, in the mind of the consumer, the
junior mark will conjure an association with the senior.�) (citing <i>Nabisco,
Inc. v. PF Brands,</i> 191 F.3d 208 (2d Cir.1999)). Accordingly, this factor
favors Nike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>(ii) Distinctiveness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> ��There are five categories of trademarks: (1)
generic; (2) descriptive; (3) suggestive; (4) arbitrary; and (5) fanciful.�� <i>Quicksilver,
Inc. v. Kymsta Corp.,</i> 466 F.3d 749, 760 (9th Cir.2006) (internal citations
omitted). �[S]uggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are �deemed inherently
distinctive and are automatically entitled to [trademark] protection because
they naturally serve to identify a particular source of a product.�� <i>Id.</i>
Suggestive marks require the use of imagination to make a connection between
the mark and an attribute of the goods or services to which it is applied. <i>Official
Airlines Guides, Inc. v. Goss,</i> 6 F.3d 1385, 1391 (9th Cir.1993).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nikepal does not dispute that NIKE is, at the very
least, suggestive. (<i>See</i> Nikepal's Proposed Findings and Recommendations
at 42 (�[Nike's] mark is suggestive when used in connection with Plaintiff's
products.�).) Accordingly, NIKE is inherently distinctive and this factor
favors Nike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>(iii) Substantially Exclusive Use</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The law does not require that use of the famous mark
be absolutely exclusive, but merely �substantially exclusive.� <i>See
L.D.Kichler Co. v. Davoil Inc.,</i> 192 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed.Cir.1999) (holding
that in the trademark context, �substantially exclusive� use does not mean
totally exclusive use). Therefore, a limited amount of third party use is
insufficient to defeat a showing of substantially exclusive use. <i>See Avery
Dennison Corp. v. Sumpton,</i> 189 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir.1999) (finding that
use of the mark was not substantially exclusive when the words �Avery� and
�Dennison� were <i>�commonly</i> used as trademarks, both on and off of the
Internet, by parties other than Avery Dennison.� (emphasis added)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nike asserts that its use of the NIKE mark is substantially
exclusive. Nikepal introduced evidence of use of the term �Nike� in the company
name �Nike Hydraulics, Inc.,� through a bottle jack purchased from the company
and a 1958 trademark registration for �Nike� owned by Nike Hydraulics. However,
this evidence is insufficient to disprove Nike's claim that its use of NIKE is
substantially exclusive. Even Nikepal's witness, Roger Smith, admitted that he
had not encountered Nike Hydraulics before hearing that name in connection with
this action. Accordingly, the court finds that Nike's use of the NIKE mark is
substantially exclusive and this factor therefore favors Nike.<a href="#_ftn76"
name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[76]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>(iv) Degree of Recognition</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The degree of recognition of NIKE is quite strong.
Millions of NIKE products are sold in the United States annually and the
evidence demonstrates that NIKE is readily recognized. This factor therefore
favors Nike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>(v) Intent to Create Association</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Mr. Sandhu admitted that he was aware of the
existence of the NIKE mark before he adopted the company name. Although he
testified at trial that he came up with the term Nikepal by opening the
dictionary to a random page and essentially finding that word by �fate,� his
testimony was not credible. Therefore, this factor favors Nike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>(vi) Actual Association</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nikepal registered the domain names nikepal.biz,
nikepal.net, nikepal.us, nikepal.info and nikepal.tv. The evidence shows that
the domain registrar assigned the domain names an �under construction� page and
then associated with that page promotions and advertisement links to a number
of web pages that offered NIKE products (or products of Nike's competitors in
the shoe and apparel field). Thus, in the internet context, there is actual
association between NIKEPAL and NIKE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Further, Mr. Johnson's survey also evinced that
there is a strong degree of association between NIKEPAL and NIKE. Mr. Johnson's
survey showed over 87% of the people in Nikepal's own customer pool associated
the stimulus �Nikepal� with NIKE. The survey presents ample proof of
association between the marks to support a finding that such exists in the
general public. Accordingly, the court finds that there is actual association
between the NIKEPAL and NIKE marks and this factor favors Nike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In conclusion, since the six factors considered in
the likelihood of dilution analysis favor Nike, there is a likelihood that NIKE
will suffer dilution if Nikepal is allowed to continue its use of NIKEPAL.
Accordingly, Nike prevails on its federal and state dilution claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II. Permanent Injunction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nike seeks an injunction for violation of the TDRA
pursuant to 15 U.S.C. � 1116(a). To establish entitlement to an injunction,
Nike must show that: it has suffered an irreparable injury; that remedies
available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for
that injury; that considering the balance of hardships between Plaintiff and
Defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and that the public interest would
not be disserved by a permanent injunction. <i>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange,
L.L.C.,</i> 547U.S. 388, ---- (2006).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> With regard to irreparable harm, if relief is not
granted to Nike under its dilution claim, it will face an escalating erosion of
its famous mark and NIKE will lose its ability to serve as a source-identifying
mark. Further, there is no adequate remedy at law because monetary damages will
not compensate for this harm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The balance of hardships also points in Nike's
favor. Although Nikepal will have to choose another name, Nikepal chose to use
the NIKEPAL mark with full awareness of the existence and widespread use of the
NIKE mark. Further, given that Nikepal's business is still relatively small, it
should not be unduly burdensome for it to notify its customers of its name
change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, the public interest will not be disserved
by the issuance of a permanent injunction against Nikepal. By preventing
dilution of NIKE, the public can continue to rely on the NIKE mark serving its
source designating function. Accordingly, Nike's request for an injunction
against Nikepal for the use of the NIKEPAL mark is granted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III. Reversal of TTAB Decision</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, Nike seeks reversal of the TTAB's decision
denying its opposition to the registration of the NIKEPAL mark. Specifically,
the TTAB held there was no likelihood of dilution based on its finding that the
parties' marks were not sufficiently similar.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[T]he Lanham Act provides two avenues for review of TTAB
decisions: review by the Federal Circuit on the closed record of the TTAB
proceedings ... or review by the district court with the option of presenting
additional evidence and raising additional claims .... In the latter scenario,
the district court sits in a dual capacity. It is an appellate reviewer of
facts found by the TTAB and is also a fact-finder based on new evidence
introduced to the court. Although the district court's review of the TTAB's
decision is considered de novo when the parties present new evidence and assert
additional claims, the district court also must afford deference to the fact
findings of the TTAB.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>CAE, Inc. v. Clean Air Eng'g, Inc</i>., 267 F.3d
660, 674 (7th Cir.2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, Nike presented new evidence in the form of, <i>inter
alia,</i> Mr. Johnson's survey showing that the vast majority of the survey
respondents, representing a significant segment of Nikepal's target customer
group, associate Nike and/or its products and services when they encounter
NIKEPAL, thus perceiving the two marks as essentially the same. <i>See Thane
Int'l, Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 906 (�The marks must be of sufficient similarity
so that, in the mind of the consumer, the junior mark will conjure an
association with the senior.�) (citing <i>Nabisco, Inc.,</i> 191 F.3d at 208); <i>see
also Playboy Enters., Inc.,</i> 279 F.3d at 806 n. 41 (holding that �[f]or
marks to be nearly identical to one another, they �must be similar enough that
a significant segment of the target group of customers sees the two marks as
essentially the same.� �). The new evidence submitted by Nike therefore compels
a contrary finding on the similarity of the parties' marks.<a href="#_ftn77"
name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[77]</span></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As to the other dilution factors that the TTAB did
not make findings on (e.g., whether Nike is engaging in substantially exclusive
use of its mark, whether NIKE is distinctive, the degree of recognition of the
NIKE mark, and whether Nikepal intended to create an association with NIKE),
the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law made above apply with equal
force here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, although the court gives deference to
TTAB's fact-finding, the evidence presented by Nike in this action compels
reversal of the TTAB's decision dismissing Nike's opposition to the
registration of Nikepal's mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Therefore, the TTAB ruling is reversed and Nike's
request for an order sustaining the opposition to Nikepal's registration for the
NIKEPAL mark is granted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>CONCLUSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For the reasons stated, Nike prevails on its
federal and state dilution claims, the decision of the TTAB is reversed, and
the opposition to Nikepal's registration of the NIKEPAL mark is sustained.
Further, Nikepal is permanently enjoined from using NIKEPAL in connection with
the offering of goods or services in commerce, including its use in domain
names, on web pages, in printed matter, and on products, and shall cease any
such uses of NIKEPAL within sixty days of the date on which this order is
filed. Nikepal may continue to use its numeric telephone number, but may not
advertise or associate it with the designation �1-877-NIKEPAL.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starbucks Corporation and Starbucks U.S. Brands LLC
(together, �Starbucks�) appeal from a judgment of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Swain, J.) denying Starbucks�
request for an injunction pursuant to the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of
1995 (�FTDA�), 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c), prohibiting Wolfe�s Borough Coffee, Inc.,
doing business as Black Bear Micro Roastery (�Black Bear�), from using Black
Bear�s �Mister Charbucks,� �Mr. Charbucks,� and �Charbucks Blend� marks (the
�Charbucks Marks�). After a bench trial followed by additional briefing from
the parties upon remand from this Court, the District Court concluded that
Starbucks failed to prove that the Charbucks Marks are likely to dilute
Starbucks� famous �Starbucks� marks (the �Starbucks Marks�) and denied
Starbucks� request for an injunction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On appeal, Starbucks argues that the District Court
erred in finding only minimal similarity and weak evidence of actual
association between the Charbucks Marks and the Starbucks Marks. Starbucks also
contends that the District Court erred in balancing the statutory dilution
factors by giving no weight at all to three of the factors&#8212;the strong
distinctiveness, exclusive use, and high degree of recognition of the Starbucks
Marks&#8212;and placing undue weight on the minimal similarity between the
marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For the following reasons, we conclude that the
District Court did not err in its factual findings, and, balancing the
statutory factors <i>de novo,</i> we agree with the District Court that
Starbucks failed to prove a likelihood of dilution. We therefore affirm.</p>

long procedural history of the case, which are set forth in our previous
opinions, <i>Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe�s Borough Coffee, Inc.,</i> 477 F.3d 765
(2d Cir.2007) (�<i>Starbucks II</i> �), and <i>Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe�s
Borough Coffee, Inc.,</i> 588 F.3d 97 (2d Cir.2009) (�<i>Starbucks IV</i> �).
We recount them here only as necessary to explain our disposition of this
appeal.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00112031966014_ID0"></a><sup>1</sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As of 2005, when the bench trial occurred,
Starbucks had grown from a single coffee shop in Seattle in 1971 to a
singularly prominent global purveyor of specialty coffee and coffee products,
with 8,700 retail locations worldwide and revenues of $5.3 billion for fiscal
year 2004. Starbucks U.S. Brands is the owner, and Starbucks Corporation a
licensee, of at least 56 valid United States trademark registrations that
include the Starbucks Marks. The Starbucks Marks are displayed on signs and at
multiple locations in each Starbucks store, as well as on the Starbucks
website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starbucks has devoted substantial time, effort, and
money to advertising and promoting the Starbucks Marks. From fiscal year 2000
to 2003, Starbucks spent over $136 million on advertising, promotion, and
related marketing activities, essentially all of which featured the Starbucks
Marks. Starbucks actively polices the Starbucks Marks, demanding that
infringing uses be terminated and, where necessary, commencing litigation.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B00222031966014_ID0"></a><sup>2</sup> Well before
Black Bear used the term �Charbucks� as part of any product name, the Starbucks
Marks were �famous� within the meaning of the FTDA. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. �
1125(c)(2)(A).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Black Bear manufactures and sells roasted coffee
beans and related goods via mail and internet order, at a limited number of New
England supermarkets, and at a single New Hampshire retail outlet. In 1997
Black Bear developed a coffee blend named �Charbucks Blend�; it now sells a
dark-roast coffee called �Mister Charbucks� or �Mr. Charbucks.� When Black Bear
began manufacturing coffee using the Charbucks Marks, it was aware of the
Starbucks Marks. One of the reasons Black Bear used the term �Charbucks� was
the public perception that Starbucks roasted its beans unusually darkly. Soon
after Black Bear began to sell Charbucks Blend, Starbucks demanded that it
cease using the Charbucks Marks. Black Bear nevertheless continued to sell
coffee under the Charbucks Marks, and in 2001 Starbucks started this action
claiming, among other things, trademark dilution in violation of 15 U.S.C. ��

style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> The
District Court held a two-day bench trial in March 2005. At trial, two matters
of significance to this appeal occurred. First, Black Bear�s founder, James O.
Clark III, testified that the name �Charbucks� had previously been used during
�the coffee wars in Boston between Starbucks and the Coffee Connection,� a Boston-based
company.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00442031966014_ID0"></a> Second,
Starbucks introduced the testimony of Warren J. Mitofsky, a scientist in the
field of consumer research and polling. Mitofsky explained the results of a
telephone survey he had conducted of six hundred participants, designed to be
representative of the United States population. The survey found that when
asked, �What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the name
�Charbucks,� spelled
C&#8211;H&#8211;A&#8211;R&#8211;B&#8211;U&#8211;C&#8211;K&#8211;S?,� 30.5 percent

asked, �Can you name any company or store that you think might offer a product
called �Charbucks�?,� 3.1 percent responded �Starbucks,� and another 1.3

�[t]he number one association of the name �Charbucks� in the minds of consumers
is with the brand �Starbucks.� � Commenting on the scope of his survey,
Mitofsky also stated: �[I]f you want to know the reaction to the name
Charbucks, then the telephone is perfectly adequate. If you want to measure the
reaction or the familiarity with other visual cues, then it�s not the right
method.� <i>Starbucks IV,</i> 588 F.3d at 104.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In December 2005 the District Court ruled in favor
of Black Bear and dismissed Starbucks� complaint. <i>See Starbucks Corp. v.
Wolfe�s Borough Coffee, Inc.,</i> No. 01 Civ. 5981, 2005 WL 3527126 (S.D.N.Y.
Dec. 23, 2005) (�<i>Starbucks I</i> �). The District Court determined that
there was neither actual dilution, which would establish a violation of federal
trademark law,<a name="co_footnoteReference_B00772031966014_ID0"></a><a
href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[81]</span></span></span></a> nor a likelihood of
dilution, which would establish a violation of New York trademark law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starbucks appealed. While the appeal was pending,
Congress passed the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (�TDRA�), which
amended the FTDA to clarify that the owner of a famous mark seeking an
injunction need prove only that the defendant�s mark �is likely to cause dilution
... of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or
likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.� 15 U.S.C. �
1125(c)(1). The TDRA further redefined �dilution by blurring� as �association
arising from the similarity between a mark <a name="co_pp_sp_506_203_1"></a>or
trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous
mark.� <i>Id.</i> � 1125(c)(2)(B). The statute provides the following direction
to courts:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>In determining whether a mark or trade name is likely
to cause dilution by blurring, the court may consider all relevant factors,
including the following:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(i) The degree of similarity between the mark or
trade name and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(ii) The degree of inherent or acquired
distinctiveness of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous
mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name
intended to create an association with the famous mark.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade
name and the famous mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> In light of this change in the governing
law, we vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded for further
proceedings. <i>Starbucks II,</i> 477 F.3d at 766.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On remand, after further briefing, the District
Court again ruled in Black Bear�s favor for substantially the same reasons set
forth in its earlier opinion, but it also analyzed the federal dilution claim
in light of the TDRA. <i>See Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe�s Borough Coffee, Inc.,</i>
559 F.Supp.2d 472, 475&#8211;79 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (�<i>Starbucks III</i> �). In
particular, the District Court considered the six non-exclusive factors listed
in the statute and made the following findings: (1) the marks were minimally
similar, which the court deemed alone sufficient to defeat Starbucks� claim;
(2) (a) the distinctiveness of the Starbucks Marks, (b) the exclusivity of
their use by Starbucks, and (c) their high degree of recognition, all weighed
in favor of Starbucks; (3) the intent factor weighed in Black Bear�s favor
because Black Bear�s intent to create an association with the Starbucks Marks
did not constitute bad faith; and (4) evidence from Mitofsky�s survey was
�insufficient to make the actual confusion factor weigh in [Starbucks�] favor
to any significant degree.� <i>Id.</i> at 477&#8211;78 (quotation marks
omitted). Balancing all six factors, the District Court held that the record
was �insufficient to demonstrate the requisite likelihood that the association
arising from the similarity of the core terms is likely to impair the
distinctiveness of Starbucks� mark, and Plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive
relief under that statute.� <i>Id.</i> at 478.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starbucks appealed again, arguing that the District
Court erred in finding that the Charbucks Marks are not likely to dilute the
Starbucks Marks. In <i>Starbucks IV,</i> we examined the District Court�s
findings as to the first, fifth, and sixth factors, as well as its balancing of
the statutory factors that bear on the likelihood of dilution by blurring. We
held that �the District Court did not clearly err in finding that the Charbucks
Marks were minimally similar to the Starbucks Marks,� 588 F.3d at 106, because
the context of the Charbucks Marks (on Black Bear�s packaging, on its website,
and in the phrases �Charbucks Blend� and �Mister Charbucks�) differentiated
them from the famous marks. We concluded, however, that �the District Court
erred to the extent it required �substantial� similarity between the marks,� <i>id.</i>
at 107, and we suggested that the District Court had overemphasized the
similarity factor. In particular, we stated that the inclusion of �the degree
of similarity� as only one of six factors in the revised statute indicates that
even a low degree of similarity would not categorically bar a
dilution-by-blurring claim. <i>Id.</i> at 108.</p>

at 109 (quotation marks omitted). Noting the survey results, which demonstrated
some degree of association between �Charbucks� and �Starbucks,� we also held
that the District Court erred by relying on evidence supporting the absence of

again found that the first factor (the similarity of the marks) favored Black
Bear because the marks were only minimally similar when presented in
commerce&#8212;that is, when the Charbucks Marks are viewed on the packaging,

District Court acknowledged that the results of the Mitofsky survey �constitute

discounted those results on the ground that the survey inquired into
associations only with the isolated word �Charbucks� and failed to present the
Charbucks Marks in full context, <i>id.</i> The court also compared the survey
results in this case with those in other cases. Here, it noted, only 30.5
percent of respondents associated �Charbucks� with �Starbucks,� while in other
trade dilution cases 70 percent to 90 percent of survey respondents associated
the relevant marks. <i>Id.</i> The District Court also compared the 3.1 percent
of respondents who thought a product called �Charbucks� would be made by
Starbucks to the 28 percent of respondents who made a similar origin
association in a Ninth Circuit trademark dilution case. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Jada
Toys, Inc. v. Mattel, Inc.,</i> 518 F.3d 628, 636 (9th Cir.2008)). With the

the TDRA�s definition of dilution by blurring as �<i>association arising from
the similarity</i> between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs
the distinctiveness of the famous mark,� the District Court explained that
�[t]he statutory language leaves no doubt� that these two <a

*5 (quoting 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2)(B)). 1 After balancing all six factors, the
District Court held that Starbucks had failed to meet its burden of showing
that it was entitled to injunctive relief:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[T]he Charbucks marks are only weakly associated with the
minimally similar Starbucks marks and, thus, are not likely to impair the

enjoin a person from using �a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to
cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark.� � <i>Tiffany
(NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc.,</i> 600 F.3d 93, 110&#8211;11 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting 15
U.S.C. $4f 1125(c)(1)). Dilution by blurring is �the whittling away of the
established trademark�s selling power and value through its unauthorized use by
others.� <i>Id.</i> at 111 (alteration and quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dilution by blurring as a cause of action was
championed initially by Frank Schechter in a 1927 law journal article. <i>See</i>
Frank I. Schechter, <i>The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection,</i> 40 Harv.
L.Rev. 813 (1927). Schechter argued that a mark both symbolizes existing good
will and can <i>generate</i> good will. <i>Id.</i> at 819 (�The mark actually <i>sells</i>
the goods. And, self-evidently, the more distinctive the mark, the more
effective is its selling power.�). So-called �[t]rademark pirates,� Schechter
explained, stopped short of infringing marks in favor of using marks similar to
well-known marks on non-competing goods, such as Kodak bicycles,
Rolls&#8211;Royce radio tubes, and Beech&#8211;Nut cigarettes. <i>Id.</i> at
825. Schechter described the injury in these cases as</p>

<p class=Blockquote>the gradual whittling away or dispersion of the identity
and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name by its use upon non-competing
goods. The more distinctive or unique the mark, the deeper is its impress upon
the public consciousness, and the greater its need for protection against vitiation
or dissociation from the particular product in connection with which it has
been used.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> Somewhat more vividly in later congressional
testimony, Schechter warned that �if you allow Rolls Royce restaurants and
Rolls Royce cafeterias, and Rolls Royce pants, and Rolls Royce candy, in 10
years you will not have the Rolls Royce mark any more.� Trade&#8211;Marks:
Hearings Held Before the H. Comm. on Patents, 72d Cong. 15 (1932) (statement of
Frank I. Schechter), <i>quoted in</i> Walter J. Derenberg, <i>The Problem of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span

antidilution statutes. <i>See</i> 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on Trademarks
and Unfair Competition</i> � 24:77 (4th ed. 2012) (�McCarthy�); Derenberg, <i>supra,</i>
at 452&#8211;61. For example, the legislative history of New York�s
antidilution statute �disclosed a need for legislation to prevent such
�hypothetical anomalies� as �Dupont shoes, Buick aspirin tablets, <a
name="co_pp_sp_506_206_1"></a>Schlitz varnish, Kodak pianos, Bulova gowns, and
so forth.� � <i>Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.,</i>
875 F.2d 1026,1031 (2d Cir.1989) (quoting 1954 N.Y. Legis. Ann. 49&#8211;50).
But the predictable result of these desultory efforts by various States to pass
antidilution laws was an uneven regulatory patchwork of protection. <i>See</i>

5577, 5583. Congress first addressed that problem in 1996, when it enacted the
FTDA, which entitled any owner of a famous mark �to an injunction against
another person�s commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such
use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the
distinctive quality of the mark....� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1) (1996).<a

(2003), which held that the FTDA required a plaintiff to prove �actual

trademark dilution claim. <i>Id.</i> at 433, 123 S.Ct. 1115. In response, the
International Trademark Association (�INTA�), a primary advocate for the FTDA,
supported a congressional amendment to abrogate <i>Moseley.</i> The proposed
amendment, which eventually became the TDRA, provided that plaintiffs need
prove only a likelihood of dilution and, thus, allowed famous mark owners to
�prevent dilution at its incipiency� and not force them to �wait until the harm

Court�s findings: (1) that <a name="co_pp_sp_506_208_1"></a>there is only a
minimal degree of similarity between the Starbucks Marks and the Charbucks
Marks; and (2) that Starbucks demonstrated only a weak association between the

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. Degree of Similarity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In <i>Starbucks IV</i> we held that �[w]ith respect
to the first factor&#8212;the degree of similarity between the marks&#8212;the
District Court did not clearly err in finding that the Charbucks Marks were
minimally similar to the Starbucks Marks.� 588 F.3d at 106. We highlighted the
difference between the Starbucks Marks and Charbucks Marks when the latter are
placed in the context of Black Bear�s packaging and the word �Charbucks� is
incorporated into the phrases �Charbucks Blend� and �Mister Charbucks.� <i>Id.</i>
�The law of the case ordinarily forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or
impliedly decided by the appellate court.� <i>United States v. Quintieri,</i>
306 F.3d 1217, 1229 (2d Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). Although not
binding, the doctrine �counsels a court against revisiting its prior rulings in
subsequent stages of the same case absent �cogent� and �compelling� reasons
such as �an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new
evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.�

compelling reason for us to revisit our ruling on the issue of similarity. It
urges that the holding in <i>Starbucks IV</i> applied only to our �likelihood
of confusion� analysis, and that the District Court erred by considering the
contexts in which consumers encounter the Charbucks Marks.<a

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. Actual Association</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starbucks next contends that the District Court�s
finding that actual association �weighs no more than minimally� in Starbucks�
favor, <i>Starbucks V,</i> 2011 WL 6747431, at *4, was error for two reasons.
First, Starbucks argues, Black Bear�s admitted intent to create an
association&#8212;the fifth statutory factor&#8212;raises a �presumption of
association,� or at least is strong evidence of actual association&#8212;the
sixth statutory factor. Second, it argues that the District Court improperly
discounted the Mitofsky survey evidence, which, in Starbucks� view, proves a
high degree of actual association. We reject both arguments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_I3a08dd2eb64e11e398db8b09b4f04"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>a. Intent to Create an Association</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As an initial matter, an intent to create an
association is a separate factor under the TDRA and does not constitute <i>per
se</i> evidence that the actual association factor weighs in favor of the owner
of the famous mark.<a name="co_footnoteReference_B012122031966014_ID"></a> In
support of its argument to the contrary, Starbucks quotes McCarthy�s treatise,
which states, �If the junior [user] intended to create an association, <a
name="co_pp_sp_506_209_1"></a>the law may assume that it succeeded.� McCarthy �
24:119. Starbucks similarly relies on <i>Federal Express Corp. v. Federal
Espresso, Inc.,</i> 201 F.3d 168 (2d Cir.2000), a dilution case in which we
stated that the trier of fact �may well find that the marks are of sufficient
similarity so that, in the mind of the consumer, the junior mark will conjure
an association with the senior, especially in light of the testimony of
[Federal Espresso�s founder] that she chose the name Federal Espresso, in part,
precisely because it would call to mind Federal Express.� <i>Id.</i> at 177
(quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both <i>Federal Espresso</i> and McCarthy�s
treatise acknowledge the importance of the intent factor in determining
likelihood of dilution. This makes sense, as district courts must evaluate
whether a junior mark is �likely to cause� �association arising from the
similarity� between the marks �that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous
mark,� 15 U.S.C. �� 1125(c)(1), (c)(2)(B), and the intent to associate may bear
directly on the likelihood that the junior mark will cause such an association.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_B72031966014_1"></a><span
style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> That said, �we interpret statutes to give effect,
if possible, to every clause and word and to avoid statutory interpretations
that render provisions superfluous.� <i>United States v. Al Kassar,</i> 660
F.3d 108, 124&#8211;25 (2d Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). Adopting
Starbucks� presumption argument would effectively merge the intent to associate
and the actual association factors, by making the former determinative of the
latter, rather than treating them as distinct but related considerations. We therefore
conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in finding that Clark�s
testimony concerning the origin of the Charbucks Marks was not an �admission�
of actual association and that his intentions were not definitive proof of an
actual association between the marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_anchor_I3a08dd2fb64e11e398db8b09b4f04"></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>b. Mitofsky Survey</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nor did the District Court err when it discounted
the Mitofsky survey evidence because the survey measured only how respondents
reacted to the isolated word �Charbucks,� rather than to the Charbucks Marks in
context, and because the share of respondents who indicated an association
between the marks was �relatively small.� <i>Starbucks V,</i> 2011 WL 6747431,
at *4. We arrive at this conclusion for two reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, it coheres with our decision in <i>Starbucks
IV,</i> in which we discerned no clear error in the District Court�s
consideration of context&#8212;including the addition of �Mister� or �Blend� to
�Charbucks� and Black Bear�s packaging&#8212;in assessing the marks�
similarity, as consumers are likely to experience the product only in the
context of those full phrases and Black Bear�s packaging or website. <i>Starbucks
IV,</i> 588 F.3d at 106. In our analysis of Starbucks� infringement claim, we
similarly determined that the District Court did not clearly err when it found
(1) that the survey failed to demonstrate significant actual confusion,
�[p]articularly in light of the fact that the survey was administered by telephone
and did not present the term �Charbucks� in the context in which Black Bear
used it,� <i>id.</i> at 117, and (2) that the survey should have examined the
effects of �a hypothetical coffee named either �Mister Charbucks� or �Charbucks
Blend� � on the respondents� impressions of Starbucks coffee as a measure of
dilution by tarnishment, <i>id.</i> at 110.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Second, our conclusion also comports with our prior
precedents and other cases unrelated to Starbucks. In <i>Playtex Products, Inc.
v. Georgia&#8211;Pacific Corp.,</i> 390 F.3d 158 (2d Cir.2004), a case
interpreting the pre-revision FTDA, we held that the results of a consumer
survey showing an <a name="co_pp_sp_506_210_1"></a>association between the
marks �Moist&#8211;Ones� and �Wet Ones� were inadmissible as evidence of actual
dilution because the defendant�s product was �presented and packaged� as �<i>Quilted
Northern</i> Moist&#8211;Ones.� <i>Id.</i> at 168 (emphasis added). District
courts within our Circuit have applied the same reasoning in evaluating surveys
in the infringement context. <i>See, e.g., THOIP v. Walt Disney Co.,</i> 690
F.Supp.2d 218, 235&#8211;40 (S.D.N.Y.2010); <i>Juicy Couture, Inc. v. L�Oreal
USA, Inc.,</i> No. 04 Civ. 7203, 2006 WL 1012939, at *25&#8211;27 (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 19,2006); <i>WE Media, Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d 463, 474
(S.D.N.Y.2002) ( �Germane survey evidence should make some effort to compare
the impressions the marks have on potential customers under marketplace
conditions.�). In the dilution context, the language of the FTDA, which
requires a plaintiff to show the defendant�s �<i>use of a mark ... in commerce</i>
that is likely to cause dilution by blurring ...,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1)
(emphasis added), clarifies that the way the defendant�s mark is used in
commerce is central to the dilution inquiry. As in <i>Playtex,</i> the District
Court was within its rights to conclude that the Mitofsky survey had limited
probative value because the defendant�s marks were not presented to survey
respondents as they are actually �presented and packaged� in commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span

nevertheless argues that consumers are likely to hear and view the term
�Charbucks� outside the context of Black Bear�s packaging and without the full
phrases �Mister Charbucks� and �Charbucks Blend.� <i>Nabisco, </i>191 F.3d at
218 (rejecting an argument under the pre-revision FTDA that packaging made two
marks dissimilar, because many consumers would see the marks outside of the

font-family:Cambria'>[86]</span></span></span></a> and in the absence of such
evidence, we are not persuaded by the argument. To the contrary, as we noted in
<i>Starbucks IV,</i> �it is unlikely that �Charbucks� will appear to consumers
outside the context of its normal use,� 588 F.3d at 106, and �it was not
clearly erroneous for the District Court to find that the �Mister� prefix or
�Blend� suffix lessened the similarity between the [marks],� <i>id.</i> at 107.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Starbucks also challenges the District Court�s
finding that the association between �Charbucks� and Starbucks was �relatively
small.� It contends that the Mitofsky survey in fact provided evidence of
substantial actual association. We disagree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> It is true that in response to Mitofsky�s question
most probative of actual association&#8212;�What is the FIRST THING that comes
to your mind when you hear the name �Charbucks,� spelled
C&#8211;H&#8211;A&#8211;R&#8211;B&#8211;U&#8211;C&#8211;K&#8211;S?�&#8212;30.5
percent of respondents said �Starbucks,� and 9 percent said �coffee.� Both of
these responses suggest an association between �Charbucks� and the Starbucks
Marks. In <i>Jada Toys, </i>518 F.3d at 636, for example, the Ninth Circuit
held that a survey demonstrated actual association because it showed that 28
percent of respondents thought Jada�s product was made by Mattel when asked who
they thought produced the item. Here, however, the equivalent question in
Mitofsky�s survey was: �Can you name any company or store that you think might
offer a product <a name="co_pp_sp_506_211_1"></a>called �Charbucks�?�<a
name="co_footnoteReference_B014142031966014_ID"></a><a href="#_ftn87"

concerning source on the Mitofsky survey, however, only 3.1 percent of
respondents answered �Starbucks� and 1.3 percent answered �coffee house.� These
percentages are far below that for the equivalent question in Jada Toys and
fail to demonstrate anything more than minimal actual association.<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Ultimately, on this factor, we consider only
whether the District Court clearly erred when it found that the Mitofsky survey
tilts the �actual association� factor �no more than minimally in [Starbucks�]
favor.� <i>Id.</i> Had the Mitofsky survey presented the Charbucks Marks as
they appear in commerce, we might well conclude that the District Court erred.
But the word �Charbucks� was presented outside of its marketplace context, and
Starbucks, which bears the burden of proof, <i>see Jada Toys,</i> 518 F.3d at
634, failed to show that this flaw did not materially impact the survey
results. We therefore conclude that the record supports the District Court�s
decision to discount the survey and consider the actual association factor as
weighing only minimally in Starbucks� favor.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>D. Balancing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We next balance the factors enumerated in �
1125(c)(2)(B), along with any other factors that bear on a likelihood of
dilution, <i>de novo.</i><a name="co_footnoteReference_B016162031966014_ID"></a>
In balancing these factors, we are again mindful that the test is not an
inflexible one, and that the ultimate question is whether the Charbucks Marks
are likely to cause an association arising from their similarity to the
Starbucks Marks, which impairs the Starbucks Marks� tendency to identify the
source of Starbucks products in a unique way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have already affirmed the District Court�s
finding of minimal similarity between the Charbucks Marks and the Starbucks
Marks. That finding weighs heavily in Black Bear�s favor. Certainly, a
plaintiff may show a likelihood of dilution notwithstanding only minimal
similarity. But here, minimal similarity strongly suggests a relatively low
likelihood of an association diluting the senior mark. The statute itself emphasizes
the similarity of marks. <i>See</i> � 1125(c)(2)(B) (defining �dilution by
blurring� as �association arising from the <i>similarity</i> between a mark or
a trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous
mark� (emphasis added)). Indeed, in <i>Starbucks IV,</i> we stated that �
�similarity� is an integral element in the definition of �blurring� � under the
TDRA and suggested that, without <i>any</i> similarity, there could be no
dilution by blurring. 588 F.3d at 108&#8211;09.<a

name="co_anchor_B102031966014_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> The
next three factors&#8212;the degrees of distinctiveness, exclusive use, and
recognition&#8212;are features of the senior mark itself that do not depend on
the use of the junior mark. �[T]he <i>degree</i> of distinctiveness of the
senior mark has a considerable bearing on the question whether a junior use
will have a diluting effect.... [T]he more distinctiveness the mark possesses,
the greater the interest to be protected.� <i>Nabisco,</i> 191 F.3d at 217.
There is no question that �Starbucks�&#8212;an arbitrary mark as applied to
coffee&#8212;is highly distinctive. <i>See id.</i> at 216. Moreover, because,
as the District Court found, the Starbucks Marks are in substantially exclusive
use, <i>see Starbucks V,</i> 2011 WL 6747431, at *3, �the mark�s
distinctiveness is more likely to be impaired by the junior use,� 2005 Hearing,
at 14 (statement of Anne Gundelfinger). Lastly, as 79 percent of Mitofsky
survey respondents were familiar with Starbucks, it is undisputed that
Starbucks constitutes a widely recognized mark, and that this factor favors
Starbucks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the three factors of distinctiveness,
recognition, and exclusivity favor Starbucks and bear to some degree on our
assessment of the likelihood of dilution by blurring, the more important
factors in the context of this case are the similarity of the marks and actual
association. We agree with the District Court that the distinctiveness,
recognition, and exclusive use of the Starbucks Marks do not overcome the weak
evidence of actual association between the Charbucks and Starbucks marks. To
the contrary, viewed in light of Starbucks� fame, both globally and among the
Mitofsky survey participants more particularly, the fact that more survey
participants did not think of �Starbucks� upon hearing �Charbucks� reinforces
the District Court�s finding that the marks are only minimally similar, and
therefore unlikely to prompt an association that impairs the Starbucks Marks.
Likewise, although the distinctiveness and exclusive use of the Starbucks Marks
help Starbucks prove <i>susceptibility</i> to dilution by association arising
from similarity between the Charbucks and Starbucks marks, they do not
demonstrate that such an association is likely to arise, as Starbucks needed to
show to obtain an injunction. Accordingly, these factors weigh only weakly in
Starbucks� favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, we attribute a moderate amount of
significance to the fifth factor, intent to create an association. Clark�s
testimony indicated that Black Bear was capitalizing on an historic connection
between the word �Charbucks� and �Starbucks,� which arose out of the so-called
�coffee-wars� in Boston, Massachusetts, <i>see Starbucks IV,</i> 588 F.3d at
111, and that he �meant to evoke an image of dark-roasted coffee of the type
offered by Starbucks,� <i>Starbucks V,</i> 2011 WL 6747431, at *5. �[W]here, as
here, the allegedly diluting mark was created with an intent to associate with
the famous mark,� <i>Starbucks IV,</i> 588 F.3d at 109, we agree with the
District Court that this factor favors a finding of a likelihood of dilution, <i>see
Starbucks V,</i> 2011 WL 6747431, at *3, *5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The final, disputed factor, actual association, is
highly relevant to likelihood of association. In the analogous context of
determining the �likelihood of confusion� for trademark infringement claims, we
have noted that �[t]here can be no more positive or substantial proof of the
likelihood of confusion than proof of actual confusion,� even though a showing
of actual <a name="co_pp_sp_506_213_1"></a>confusion is not necessary to
prevail on such a claim. <i>Savin Corp. v. Savin Grp.,</i> 391 F.3d 439, 459
(2d Cir.2004) (quoting <i>World Carpets, Inc. v. Dick Littrell�s New World
Carpets,</i> 438 F.2d 482, 489 (5th Cir.1971)). The same principle obtains with
respect to proof of actual association in dilution claims. And as noted, the
Mitofsky survey demonstrated weak actual association, at best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Weighing the factors above <i>de novo,</i> we agree
with the District Court that Starbucks did not demonstrate a likelihood of
dilution by blurring. Ultimately what tips the balance in this case is that
Starbucks bore the burden of showing that it was entitled to injunctive relief
on this record. Because Starbucks� principal evidence of association, the
Mitofsky survey, was fundamentally flawed, and because there was minimal
similarity between the marks at issue, we agree with the District Court that
Starbucks failed to show that Black Bear�s use of its Charbucks Marks in
commerce is likely to dilute the Starbucks Marks.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>II. The Parties</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Opposer was founded by fashion designer Gabrielle
�Coco� Chanel who entered the fashion business in 1910 in Paris, France with
the opening of a small millinery shop under the name �Chanel Modes.� Following
the popularity of her custom designed hats, she expanded her product line to
clothing. In 1913, she opened a fashion boutique in Deauville, France and then,
in 1915, her first couture house in Biarritz, France. The following year, Coco
Chanel received acclaim from the U.S. press for her ��charming chemise dress.�
In 1921, she introduced her first perfume, CHANEL No. 5, which continues to be
one of the best-selling fragrances on the market today. She began designing and
selling costume jewelry in 1924. Later, in 1926, she became known for her
design of the �little black dress.� Following World War II, she reestablished
herself as a fashion designer with the introduction of the �now-classic�
quilted fabric handbag with chain and leather shoulder strap, marketed under
the CHANEL brand name. In the 1950s, Stanley Marcus, owner of the U.S.
department store Neiman Marcus, honored Coco Chanel with an award as the most
influential fashion designer of the twentieth century. When Coco Chanel passed
away in 1971, all rights in her name and business were assigned to opposer and
related companies. Shortly thereafter, opposer launched a full line of
cosmetics under the name CHANEL BEAUT� as well as a retail store collection of
ready-to-wear clothing and accessories under the name CHANEL BOUTIQUE. <i>Id.</i>
Opposer�s clothing product line varies each year, with at least six different
ready-to-wear collections and two <i>haute couture</i> collections annually.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;<a name="co_pp_sp_999_5_1"></a>Opposer
commenced use of CHANEL in the United States as a trademark and trade name at
least as early as the 1930s. Currently opposer owns 60 active U.S.
registrations consisting of or comprising the term CHANEL. Opposer markets luxury
consumer products in the United States in various trade channels, including
opposer�s own CHANEL boutiques and third-party retailers such as Saks Fifth
Avenue and Neiman Marcus. The price-point for opposer�s goods ranges from nail
polish retailing at $27 and sunglasses at $300 to handbags and <i>haute couture</i>
clothing items costing thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span

of real property, including www.condomonde.com, www.condominiums.com, and
www.hermesrealty.ca. As a part of his marketing strategy, applicant promoted on
his web site a building with units apparently named after luxury brands

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, we consider opposer�s claim of dilution by
blurring. The Trademark Act provides a cause of action for the dilution of
famous marks. <i>See</i> Sections 13 and 43(c) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C.
�� 1063 and 1125(c). Section 43(c) provides as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous
mark that is distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall
be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at any time after the
owner�s mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in
commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by
tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual
or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.</p>

gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Opposer contends that applicant�s applied-for
CHANEL mark will dilute the distinctiveness of opposer�s CHANEL mark. The
Trademark Act defines dilution by blurring as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>�[D]ilution by blurring� is association arising from the
similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the
distinctiveness of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Section 43(c)(2)(B) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. �
1125(c)(2)(B). �Dilution diminishes the �selling power that a distinctive mark

for the Federal Circuit, has set forth the following four elements a plaintiff
must prove in order to prevail on a claim of dilution by blurring in a Board
proceeding:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(1) that plaintiff owns a famous mark that is
distinctive;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>(2) the defendant is using a mark in commerce that

addition, �a mark must be not only famous, but also so distinctive that the
public would associate the term with the owner of the famous mark even when it
encounters the term apart from the owner�s goods or services, i.e., devoid of
its trademark context.� <i>Toro</i>, 61 USPQ2d at 1177, <i>citing</i> H.R. REP.
No. 104-374, at 3 (1995) (�the mark signifies something unique, singular, or

43(c), which provides that distinctiveness of a famous mark can be shown either
through inherent or acquired distinctiveness.<a
name="co_footnoteReference_FN_F7_ID0EP6AE_1"></a> Fame and distinctiveness are
�two overlapping, but slightly different, concepts.� <i>Toro</i>, 61 USPQ2d at

definition, all �trademarks� are �distinctive�--very few are �famous.�� 4 J.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Dilution by blurring is an �association arising
from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs
the distinctiveness of the famous mark,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2)(B), and may be
found �regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of
competition, or of actual economic injury,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1). Dilution by
blurring occurs when a substantial percentage of consumers, upon seeing the
junior party�s use of a mark on its goods or services, are immediately reminded
of the famous mark and associate the junior party�s use with the owner of the
famous mark, even if they do not believe, for example, that the goods or
services come from the famous mark�s owner, or that the famous mark�s owner
approves the goods or services. <i>See e.g., Nike Inc. v. Maher</i>, 100 USPQ2d
1018 (TTAB 2011); <i>National Pork Board v. Supreme Lobster and Seafood Co.,</i>
96 USPQ2d 1479 (TTAB 2010). In addition, we must determine not only whether
there is an �association� arising from the similarity of the marks, but whether
such association is likely to �impair� the distinctiveness of the famous mark. <i>Nike
Inc. v. Maher</i>, 100 USPQ2d 1018, 1023 (TTAB 2011) (<i>�Nike v. Maher�</i>).
In determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to cause dilution by
blurring, the Board may consider the following six non-exhaustive factors [from
<a name="co_pp_sp_999_14_1"></a>15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2)(B)(i)-(vi)].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>1. The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name
and the famous mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this case, there is no dispute that the marks in
question are identical. Indeed, applicant admitted in his answer and also
stipulated that his applied-for mark CHANEL is identical to opposer�s mark and
trade name CHANEL. This factor therefore favors finding a likelihood of
dilution by blurring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>2. The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness
of the famous mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �This factor requires us to analyze how distinctive
or �unique� the mark is to the public. The inquiry is made even when it is
undisputed that opposer�s mark is registered on the Principal Register.� <i>NASDAQ
Stock Market Inc. v. Antartica S.r.l.,</i> 69 USPQ2d 1718, 1735 (TTAB 2003).
�The more inherently distinctive and memorable the mark, the more it is likely
to be blurred by the use of other identical or similar marks. The more
descriptive the mark, the less likely it is to be blurred by uses of identical
or similar marks.� Testimony of Anne Gundelfinger, President, International
Trademark Association, before House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and
Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, February 17, 2005 (109th
Cong., 1st Sess.), 2005 WL 408425.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As noted above, opposer�s mark CHANEL was
originally derived from the designer Coco Chanel�s surname. The origin of
opposer�s brand name, however, does not diminish its distinctiveness. Indeed,
opposer has submitted voluminous evidence that the media uses the term CHANEL
to refer solely to opposer. In any event, the discussion above regarding
opposer�s extensive evidence of fame of the CHANEL mark used in connection with
clothing, fashion accessories, beauty products and boutiques more than
sufficiently establishes that opposer�s CHANEL mark has acquired a high degree
of distinctiveness among consumers. This factor therefore also favors a finding
of likelihood of dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>3. The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is
engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The record reflects that opposer has indeed engaged
in �substantially exclusive� use of its CHANEL mark. Opposer stated that due to
the fame and value of its CHANEL mark, it vigorously enforces its exclusive use
and only permits one other unrelated third-party, Luxottica S.r.L., licensed
permission to use the CHANEL mark in connection with eyewear products. The
Luxottica license agreement contains �strict quality standards to ensure that
products bearing the CHANEL mark meet the same standards for which Chanel has
long been known.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_999_15_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> In
addition, opposer stated that it expends a �great deal of resources policing
the CHANEL mark,� employing a trademark watch service to monitor third-party
use. This statement is corroborated by the record evidence showing that from
1998 to the present, opposer has filed over one hundred (100) trademark
infringement lawsuits and sent over one thousand (1,000) cease and desist
letters, leading the New York Times in 2007 to identify opposer as one of the
top ten filers of trademark suits. This includes eight opposition proceedings
before the Board, and seventeen successful domain name disputes before WIPO.
The record further shows no other unconsented uses of the mark CHANEL by third
parties. Accordingly, on this record, we find that opposer has made
substantially exclusive use of the CHANEL trademark, and therefore, this
dilution factor favors opposer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>4. The degree of recognition of the famous mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The discussion of fame above shows that opposer�s
CHANEL mark enjoys a high degree of recognition among consumers. In particular
we note the following: opposer�s surveys conducted in the ordinary course of
business showing a high degree of unaided consumer recognition; third-party
consumer recognition surveys in both print and social media form (e.g. <i>Women�s
Wear Daily, Businessweek,</i> Facebook); the extensive level of unsolicited
third-party media coverage; and the number of prestigious industry awards. Such
evidence demonstrates that CHANEL is widely recognized by the general consuming
public as a mark identifying opposer�s particular style of clothing, fashion
accessories, fragrances, beauty products and retail services. This high degree
of consumer recognition favors opposer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>5. Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended
to create an association with the famous mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Opposer has presented evidence demonstrating that
applicant intended to create an association with opposer�s famous CHANEL mark,
despite the fact that opposer never licensed applicant to use the mark (either
orally or in writing) and has never even conducted any business with applicant.
According to publicly available evidence opposer obtained from applicant�s
websites, www.condomonde.com and www.condominiums.com, applicant markets luxury
rental properties by naming units after luxury brands such as Chanel, Dior,
Givenchy, and Versace. Applicant stated on his web site that opposer Chanel is
among his former or current clients, referring to the Chanel boutiques as �the
world�s finest� along with other fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton, Prada
and Gucci. Indeed, applicant, in promoting his services on his web site, has
referred to the elevated status he purportedly enjoys from his relationship
with Chanel. Opposer�s corporate counsel testified however that opposer �has
not done business with the applicant, nor have we licensed the CHANEL mark to
him.�&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="co_pp_sp_999_16_1"></a><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span
style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span style='color:gray'>]</span> We
therefore find that applicant is attempting to trade on the goodwill and fame
generated by the CHANEL mark in order to promote and market his own services.
As such, this dilution factor also favors opposer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>6. Any actual association between the mark or trade
name and the famous mark</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Insofar as opposer presented no evidence regarding
this factor, it is deemed neutral.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In summary, each factor, with the exception of the
sixth factor discussed above which was deemed neutral, favors a finding of
likelihood of dilution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>7. Impairment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The statute requires opposer to prove impairment of
the distinctiveness of opposer�s famous mark. <i>See Nike Inc. v. Maher</i>,
100 USPQ2d at 1023. <i>See also Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Haute Diggity
Dog LLC</i>, 507 F.3d 252 (4th Cir. 2007). Opposer stated that if applicant
were to obtain a registration, �his use of our very mark will devalue the
CHANEL brand and cause significant harm to Chanel by diluting the
distinctiveness of Chanel�s famous mark.� We note that although opposer has no
current involvement in the real estate or hotel industry, the record shows that
many luxury brand companies have licensed use of their marks in connection with
hotels. In other words, they have found opportunities to commercially exploit
the distinctiveness of their marks in those industries. In addition, many other
well-known luxury brands have either expanded into or licensed use of their
brand names in fields outside of the fashion industry that are related to real
estate. For example, Versace now offers interior design services, Fendi
provides kitchen design services and Jason Wu markets designer-styled bathroom
fixtures. We find these statements and surrounding circumstances of the
industry sufficient to show that opposer is likely to suffer an impairment of
the distinctiveness of its CHANEL mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In summary, we find that based on the record before
us, opposer has demonstrated that applicant�s CHANEL mark is likely to cause
dilution by blurring of its CHANEL trademarks and service marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <span>Decision</span>: The opposition is sustained
on opposer�s claim of dilution by blurring. Insofar as we are sustaining the
opposition on this ground, we need not consider opposer�s remaining claims
under Sections 2(a) and 2(d) of the Trademark Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=CommentsandQuestions align=center style='text-align:center'>Comments and
Questions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.<i> How Similar Must the Parties Marks Be to Show
Dilution?</i> The <i>Nikepal</i> court applied an �identical or nearly
identical� standard of similarity in its blurring analysis, following <i>Thane
Int'l, Inc. v. Trek Bicycle Corp</i>., 305 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002).&nbsp; The
Second Circuit, however, has rejected this approach. In <i>Starbucks Corp. v.
Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc</i>., 588 F.3d 97 (2d Cir. 2009), it emphasized
that the new statute �does not use the words �very� or �substantial� in connection
with the similarity factor,� <i>id</i>. at 108, and reasoned that if courts
were to impose a heightened similarity standard, this would give undue weight
to the similarity factor&#8212;by turning the heightened similarity requirement
into a threshold requirement that would short-circuit the six-factor
multifactor balancing test for blurring. (The Second Circuit found that New
York state anti-dilution law, by contrast, does impose a requirement that the
marks be ��substantially� similar,� <i>id</i>. at 114).&nbsp; In <i>Levi Strauss
&amp; Co. v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Trading Co</i>., 633 F.3d 1158 (9th Cir.
2011), the Ninth Circuit subsequently followed the Second Circuit�s reasoning:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Turning to the language of subsection (c)(2)(B), the TDRA
defines �dilution by blurring� as the �association arising from the similarity
between a mark and a trade name and a famous mark that impairs the
distinctiveness of the famous mark.� Id. � 1125(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added).
Congress did not require an association arising from the �substantial�
similarity, �identity� or �near identity� of the two marks. The word chosen by
Congress, �similarity,� sets forth a less demanding standard than that employed
by many courts under the FTDA.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 1171.&nbsp; Do you find the Second and
Ninth Circuits� reasoning persuasive? As a matter of sound policy, should
courts require a heightened standard of similarity when analyzing a blurring
claim? And in any case, are you persuaded that Nike and Nikepal are nearly
identical?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. <i>Association or Association that Impairs Distinctiveness?</i>
Recall that the TDRA defines dilution by blurring as �association...that
impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.� The <i>Nikepal</i> court found
evidence of association, but it never addressed the question of whether this
association �impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.� Can we assume, as
the <i>Nikepal</i> court appears to do, that any association necessarily
impairs the distinctiveness of the plaintiff�s mark? Consider what the Supreme
Court said in <i>Moseley</i>:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>We do agree, however, with [the] conclusion that, at least
where the marks at issue are not identical, the mere fact that consumers
mentally associate the junior user�s mark with a famous mark is not sufficient
to establish actionable dilution. [S]uch mental association will not necessarily
reduce the capacity of the famous mark to identify the goods of its owner, the
statutory requirement for dilution under the FTDA. For even though Utah drivers
may be reminded of the circus when they see a license plate referring to the
�greatest <i>snow</i> on earth,� it by no means follows that they will
associate �the greatest show on earth� with skiing or snow sports, or associate
it less strongly or exclusively with the circus. �Blurring� is not a necessary
consequence of mental association. (Nor, for that matter, is �tarnishing.�)</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue</i>, 537 U.S. 418
(2003). On remand, the <i>Moseley</i> district court took the Supreme Court�s
teaching very much to heart. <i>See</i> <i>V Secret Catalogue, Inc. v. Moseley</i>,
558 F. Supp. 2d 734 (W.D. Ky. 2008). It found all six blurring factors to favor
the plaintiff, but nevertheless found no blurring: �The choice of name and
presentation by the Moseleys being just slightly different from the VICTORIA'S
SECRET mark, conjured the association with the famous mark, but fell short of
blurring its distinctiveness in this instance.� <i>Id</i>. at 748. How can the
plaintiff prove that association impairs the distinctiveness of its mark? (Note
that the <i>Moseley</i> district court found tarnishment instead, <i>id</i>. at
750).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. <i>Are Some Trademarks So Strong as to Be Immune to
Blurring?</i> In 2000, Professors Maureen Morrin and Jacob Jacoby, the latter
of whom is a highly regarded trademark survey expert, reported the results of
two studies they conducted to detect the effects of diluting stimuli on brand
recognition and recall in test subjects. <i>See</i> Maureen Morrin &amp; Jacob
Jacoby, <i>Trademark Dilution: Empirical Measures for an Elusive Concept</i>,
19 J. Pub. Pol. &amp; Marketing 265 (2000). Among other findings, they
reported: �It appears that very strong brands are immune to dilution because
their memory connections are so strong that it is difficult for consumers to
alter them or create new ones with the same brand name.� <i>Id</i>. at 274.
Does this make sense to you? What are the implications of such a finding for
anti-dilution protection, a form of protection granted only to brands �widely
recognized by the general consuming public of the United States�? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. <i>Does Dilution Protection Make Any Difference in
Practice?</i> Commentators have long asserted that the very marks that qualify
for dilution protection rarely need it. This is because such marks will likely
win the conventional likelihood of confusion cause of action both because of
their enormous fame and because the scope of the likelihood of confusion cause
of action has expanded dramatically in the past few decades. <i>See, e.g.</i>,
Mark P. McKenna, <i>The Normative Foundations of Trademark Law</i>, 82 Notre
Dame L. Rev. 1839, 1913-14 (2007). For example, if a defendant were to begin to
sell Coca-Cola brand bicycles, how likely is it that Coca-Cola�s lawyers would
be able to prove some degree of confusion?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Empirical evidence suggests that when courts consider both
confusion and dilution, their dilution determinations are usually redundant of
their confusion determinations. One study found that in the year following the
October 6, 2006, effective date of the TDRA, no reported federal court opinion
that considered both confusion and dilution found the latter but not the
former. <i>See</i> Barton Beebe, <i>The Continuing Debacle of U.S. Antidilution
Law: Evidence from the First Year of Trademark Dilution Revision Act Case Law</i>,
24 Santa Clara Computer &amp; High Tech. L.J. 449 (2008). This trend appears to
have continued. In the three and a half years following the effective date of
the TDRA, two reported federal court opinions have analyzed both confusion and
dilution and found the latter but not the former, and one of these opinions was
a dissent. <i>See</i> Hershey Co. v. Art Van Furniture, Inc., No. 08 Civ.
14463, 2008 WL 4724756 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 24, 2008); American Century Proprietary
Holdings, Inc. v. American Century Casualty Co., 295 Fed. Appx. 630 (5th Cir.
Oct. 3, 2008) (Garwood, J., dissenting).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not to say that the dilution case of action never
provides relief not already provided by a confusion cause of action. As in <i>Nikepal</i>,
courts may decline to consider confusion at all in their opinions and move
directly to a finding of dilution. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>V Secret Catalogue,
Inc. v. Moseley</i>, 558 F. Supp. 2d 734 (W.D. Ky. 2008).&nbsp; And as in <i>Chanel
v. Makarczyk</i>, Opp. No. 91208352, 2013 WL __ (T.T.A.B. May 27, 2014) , a
mark may be opposed in T.T.A.B. proceedings solely on the basis that it dilutes
the opposer�s mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.&nbsp; <i>Dilution and Misappropriation</i>.&nbsp; The
European Trade Mark Directive explicitly provides for protection against the
taking of �unfair advantage of � the distinctive character or repute of the
trade mark.�&nbsp; EC Trade Mark Directive, Parliament and Council Directive
2008/95, art. 5(2), 2008 O.J. (L 299) 28, 29 (EC).&nbsp; The TDRA contains no
such prohibition against the misappropriation of a mark�s �selling
power.�&nbsp; David Franklyn has argued that dilution is essentially a form of
�free-riding�, that courts often hold in favor of diluted plaintiff�s in an
effort to punish free-riding, and that �it would be better to scrap dilution
altogether and replace it with an independent cause of action that explicitly
prevents free-riding in appropriate circumstances.�&nbsp; David J. Franklyn,
Debun<i>king Dilution Doctrine: Toward a Coherent Theory of the Anti-Free-Rider
Principle in American Trademark Law</i>, 56 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Hastings
L.J</span>. 117 (2004).&nbsp; Do you support this proposal?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a historical matter, Schechter himself based nearly all
of his theory of dilution on a 1924 German court opinion known as the <i>Odol</i>
opinion.&nbsp; See <i>Odol darf auch f�r g�nzlich verschiedene Waren wie
Mundwasser nicht verwendet werden; Entscheidung des Landgerichts Elberfeld vom</i>
<i>14. Sept. 1924 13. O. 89/24</i>, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Gewerblicher
Rechtsschutz und Urheberrecht</span> [GRUR] 204 (1924).&nbsp; But in attempting
to sell his theory of dilution to American readers, Schechter apparently
deliberately excluded from his translation of the <i>Odol</i> opinion the
court�s core holding, that the defendant sought �to appropriate thus the fruits
of another�s labor.�&nbsp; Why might Schechter have suppressed the misappropriation
nature of trademark dilution when writing to American lawyers in the 1920s, at
the height of American Legal Realism?&nbsp; For an answer, see Barton Beebe, <i>The
Suppressed Misappropriation Origins of Trademark Antidilution Law: the
Landgericht Elberfeld�s</i> Odol <i>Opinion and Frank Schechter�s The Rational
Basis of Trademark Protection</i>, in <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Intellectual
Property at the Edge: The Contested Contours of IP</span> (Rochelle Dreyfuss
&amp; Jane Ginsburg eds, 2013) (�What Schechter sought to obscure in <i>Rational
Basis</i> is that the <i>Odol</i> case was not, strictly speaking, a trademark
case. Rather, it was a misappropriation case that happened to involve a
trademark.�).&nbsp; <i>But see</i> Robert Bone, Schechter�s Ideas in Historical
Context and Dilution�s Rocky Road, 24 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Santa
Clara Computer &amp; High Tech. L.J.</span> 469 (2008).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. <i>Blurring and �Imagination Costs�</i>.&nbsp; Do you
accept that an increase in consumers� �imagination costs� represents a
significant harm?&nbsp; For a very strong critique of this
�cognitive/internal-search-costs model� of blurring, see Rebecca Tushnet, <i>Gone
in Sixty Milliseconds: Trademark Law and Cognitive Science</i>, 86 <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In this trademark �dilution by tarnishment� case,
brought under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006,<a href="#_ftn91"
name="_ftnref91" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[91]</span></span></span></a> the question is whether the
plaintiff, an international lingerie company that uses the trade name designation
�Victoria's Secret� has a valid suit for injunctive relief against the use of
the name �Victor's Little Secret� or �Victor's Secret� by the defendants, a
small retail store in a mall in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, that sells assorted
merchandise, including �sex toys� and other sexually oriented products. The
District Court issued the injunction. Since then the shop has been operating
under the name of �Cathy's Little Secret.� The District Court concluded that
even though the two parties do not compete in the same market, the �Victor's
Little Secret� mark&#8212;because it is sex related&#8212;disparages and tends
to reduce the positive associations and the �selling power� of the �Victoria's
Secret� mark. The question is whether the plaintiff's case meets the definitions
and standards for �dilution by tarnishment� set out in the new Act which
amended the old Act, <i>i.e.,</i> the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995.<a
href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The new Act was expressly intended to overrule the
Supreme Court interpretation of the old Act in this very same case, <i>Moseley
v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 418 (2003), <i>rev'g</i> 259 F.3d 464
(6th Cir.2001), <i>aff'g</i> 54 U.S.P.Q.2d 1092 (W.D.Ky.2000). The Supreme
Court reversed a panel of this Court that had affirmed an injunction against
�Victor's Little Secret� issued by the District Court. On remand to the
District Court from the Supreme Court after the 2003 reversal, no new evidence
was introduced, and the District Court reconsidered the case based on the same
evidence but used the new language in the new Act which overrules the Supreme
Court in this case. We will first brief the Supreme Court opinion and the
reasons Congress overruled the Supreme Court in this case. We will then outline
our understanding of the new standards for measuring trademark �dilution by
tarnishment� and apply them to this case. We conclude that the new Act creates
a kind of rebuttable presumption, or at least a very strong inference, that a
new mark used to sell sex related products is likely to tarnish a famous mark
if there is a clear semantic association between the two. That presumption has
not been rebutted in this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered><span style='font-style:normal'>I. The Supreme Court Opinion
and the New Act</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Supreme Court explained that this case started
when an Army Colonel at Fort Knox saw an ad for �Victor's Secret� in a weekly
publication. It advertised that the small store in Elizabethtown sold adult
videos and novelties and lingerie.<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[93]</span></span></span></a>
There was no likelihood of confusion between the two businesses or the two
marks, but the Army Colonel was offended because the sexually-oriented business
was semantically associating itself with �Victoria's Secret.� The Court
explained that the concepts of �dilution by blurring� and �dilution by
tarnishment� originated with an article in the Harvard Law Review, Frank
Schechter, �Rational Basis of Trademark Protection,� 40 HARV. L.REV. 813
(1927), and that the history and meaning of the concepts were further well explained
in Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, Section 25 (1995). The
Restatement section referred to by the Supreme Court explains this new
intellectual property tort and contains in � 25 a comprehensive statement of
�Liability Without Proof of Confusion: Dilution and Tarnishment.�
�Tarnishment,� as distinguished from �dilution by blurring� was the only claim
before the Supreme Court and is the only claim before us in this new appeal. We
quote at length the relevant Restatement explanation of �tarnishment� in the
footnote below.<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After reviewing a number of secondary sources other
than the Harvard Law Review article and the Restatement, including state
statutes on dilution and a Fourth Circuit case, the Supreme Court held that
�actual harm� rather than merely the �likelihood of tarnishment� is necessary
and stated its conclusion as follows:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Noting that consumer surveys and other means of
demonstrating actual dilution are expensive and often unreliable, respondents
[Victoria's Secret] and their <i>amici</i> argue that evidence of <i>an actual</i>
�lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods
or services,� may be difficult to obtain. It may well be, however, that direct
evidence of dilution such as consumer surveys will not be necessary <i>if
actual dilution can reliably be proved</i> through circumstantial
evidence&#8212;the obvious case is one where the junior and senior marks are
identical. <i>Whatever difficulties of proof may be entailed, they are not an
acceptable reason for dispensing with proof of an essential element of a
statutory violation.</i> The evidence in the present record is not sufficient
to support the summary judgment on the dilution count. The judgment is
therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>537 U.S. at 434, 123 S.Ct. 1115 (emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, the Court held that �actual harm� rather than
merely a �likelihood� of harm must be shown by Victoria's Secret in order to
prevail and that this means that Victoria's Secret carries the burden of
proving an actual �lessening of the capacity of the Victoria's Secret mark to
identify and distinguish goods or services sold in Victoria's Secret stores or
advertised in its catalogs.� <i>Id.</i> In the new law Congress rejected the
Court's view that a simple �likelihood� of an association in the consumer's
mind of the Victoria's Secret mark with the sexually-oriented videos and toys
of �Victor's Secret� is insufficient for liability.</p>

special attention to the �burden� of proof or persuasion placed on �trademark

whether �Victor's Little Secret� with its association with lewd sexual toys

Standard</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The specific question in this case is whether,
without consumer surveys or polls or other evidence, a semantic �association�
is equivalent to a liability-creating mental �association� of a junior mark
like �Victor's Little Secret� with a famous mark like �Victoria's Secret� that
constitutes dilution by tarnishment when the junior mark is used to sell sexual
toys, videos and similar soft-core pornographic products. There appears to be a
clearly emerging consensus in the case law, aided by the language of � 25 of
the Restatement of Trademarks 3d, quoted in footnote 4, <i>supra,</i> that the
creation of an �association� between a famous mark and lewd or bawdy sexual
activity disparages and defiles the famous mark and reduces the commercial
value of its selling power. This consensus stems from an economic prediction
about consumer taste and how the predicted reaction of conventional consumers
in our culture will affect the economic value of the famous mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> There have been at least eight federal cases in six
jurisdictions that conclude that a famous mark is tarnished when its mark is
semantically associated with a new mark that is used to sell sex-related
products. We find no exceptions in the case law that allow such a new mark
associated with sex to stand. <i>See Pfizer Inc. v. Sachs,</i> 652 F.Supp.2d

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The phrase �likely to cause dilution� used in the
new statute (see footnote 1) significantly changes the meaning of the law from
�causes actual harm� under the preexisting law. The word �likely� or
�likelihood� means �probably,� WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY
1310 (1963); BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1076 (1968). It is important to note also
that the Committee Report quoted above seeks to reduce the �burden� of
evidentiary production on the trademark holder. The burden-of-proof problem,
the developing case law, and the Restatement (Third) of Trademarks in � 25
(particularly subsection g) should now be interpreted, we think, to create a
kind of rebuttable presumption, or at least a very strong inference, that a new
mark used to sell sex-related products is likely to tarnish a famous mark if
there is a clear semantic association between the two. This <i>res ipsa
loquitur</i>&#8212;like effect is not conclusive but places on the owner of the
new mark the burden of coming forward with evidence that there is no likelihood
or probability of tarnishment. The evidence could be in the form of expert
testimony or surveys or polls or customer testimony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the present case, the Moseleys have had two
opportunities in the District Court to offer evidence that there is no real
probability of tarnishment and have not done so. They did not offer at oral
argument any suggestion that they could make such a showing or wanted the case
remanded for that purpose. The fact that Congress was dissatisfied with the <i>Moseley</i>
result and the <i>Moseley</i> standard of liability, as well as apparently the <i>Moseley</i>
burden of proof, supports the view of Victoria's Secret that the present
record&#8212;in the eyes of the legislative branch&#8212;shows a likelihood of
tarnishment. Without evidence to the contrary or a persuasive defensive theory
that rebuts the presumption, the defendants have given us no basis to reverse
the judgment of the District Court. We do not find sufficient the defendants'
arguments that they should have the right to use Victor Moseley's first name
and that the effect of the association is <i>de minimis.</i> The Moseleys do
not have a right to use the word �secret� in their mark. They use it only to
make the association with the Victoria's Secret mark. We agree that the
tarnishing effect of the Moseley's mark on the senior mark is somewhat
speculative, but we have no evidence to overcome the strong inference created
by the case law, the Restatement, and Congressional dissatisfaction with the
burden of proof used in this case in the Supreme Court. The new law seems
designed to protect trademarks from any unfavorable sexual associations. Thus, any
new mark with a lewd or offensive-to-some sexual association raises a strong
inference of tarnishment. The inference must be overcome by evidence that
rebuts the probability that some consumers will find the new mark both
offensive and harmful to the reputation and the favorable symbolism of the
famous mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Our dissenting colleague, in relying on the Supreme
Court treatment of the proof in this case&#8212;for example, the long quotation
from the Supreme Court concerning the legal effect of the evidence&#8212;fails
to concede what seems obvious: Congress overruled the Supreme Court's view of
the burden of proof. As quoted above, it said, �the Moseley standard creates an
undue burden for trademark holders who contest diluting uses� It seems clear
that the new Act demonstrates that Congress intended that a court should reach
a different result in this case if the facts remain the same. We do not
necessarily disagree with our dissenting colleague that the policy followed by
the Supreme Court in such cases may be better. We simply believe that the will
of Congress is to the contrary with regard to the proof in this case and with
regard to the method of allocating the burden of proof.</p>

exception of one small quibble. I would not use the term �rebuttable

products is likely to tarnish a famous mark if there is a clear semantic
association between the two. Practically speaking, what the inference is called
makes little difference. I agree with the majority opinion that the inference is
a strong one and that, to counter it, some evidence that there is no likelihood
or probability of tarnishment is required. But because we are endeavoring to
interpret a new law and because the legislative history is not explicit on the
point of modification of the burden of proof, I think it best to end our
analysis by characterizing the inference as an inference.</p>

�harm� that the association causes to the senior mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Victoria's Secret's evidence of tarnishment
includes nothing more than the following: (1) an affidavit from Army Colonel
John E. Baker stating that he �was ... offended by [the] defendants' use of
[Victoria's Secret's] trademark to promote ... unwholesome, tawdry
merchandise,� such as � �adult� novelties and gifts,� and that since his �wife
... and ... daughter ... shop at Victoria's Secret, [he] was further dismayed
by [the] defendants' effort to associate itself with, trade off on the image
of, and in fact denigrate a store frequented by members of [his] family,�
Record on Appeal (�ROA�) at 267 (Baker Aff.); and (2) a statement from one of
Victoria's Secret's corporate officers that Victoria's Secret strives to
�maintain[ ] an image that is sexy and playful� and one that �avoid[s] sexually
explicit or graphic imagery.� <i>Id.</i> at 90 (Kriss Aff.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Reviewing Baker's affidavit, I believe that it is
plain that Baker made a �mental association� between �Victor's Little Secret�
and �Victoria's Secret.� <i>Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S.
418, 434, 123 S.Ct. 1115, 155 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003); <i>see also</i> ROA at 266
(Baker Aff.). It is also clear that Baker held a negative impression of
�Victor's Little Secret.� <i>See Moseley,</i> 537 U.S. at 434, 123 S.Ct. 1115; <i>see
also</i> ROA at 267 (Baker Aff.). But despite the clear negative association of
this <i>one</i> individual when confronted with �Victor's Little Secret,�
Victoria's Secret has presented <i>no</i> evidence that Baker's, or anyone
else's, distaste or dislike of �Victor's Little Secret� is likely to taint
their positive opinion or perception of Victoria's Secret. Yet evidence that
the junior mark is likely to undermine or alter the positive associations of
the senior mark&#8212;i.e., evidence that the junior mark is likely to harm the
reputation of the senior mark&#8212;is precisely the showing required under the
plain language of 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2)(C) to prove dilution by tarnishment.
As the Second Circuit recently noted in <i>Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough
Coffee, Inc.,</i> 588 F.3d 97 (2d Cir.2009):</p>

<p class=Blockquote>That a consumer may associate a negative-sounding junior
mark with a famous mark says little of whether the consumer views the junior
mark as harming the reputation of the famous mark. The more relevant question,
for purposes of tarnishment, would have been how a hypothetical coffee [with a
negative-sounding name] would affect the positive impressions about the coffee
sold by Starbucks.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Starbucks Corp.,</i> 588 F.3d at 110; <i>see also</i>
J. Thomas McCarthy, 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition � 24:89
(4th ed.) [hereinafter McCarthy on Trademarks] (discussing tarnishment claims
as being premised on the notion that �positive associations� of the senior mark
will be displaced or degraded by the negative associations of the junior mark);
Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition � 25 cmt. g (1995) (�To prove a case
of tarnishment, the prior user must demonstrate that the subsequent use is
likely to ... undermine or damage the positive associations evoked by the
mark.�). In fact, when reviewing the exact same evidentiary record, the Supreme
Court explicitly noted that Victoria's Secret's offer of proof included no
evidence that �Victor's Little Secret� affected Baker's positive impressions of
Victoria's Secret:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>The record in this case establishes that an army officer
... did make the mental association with �Victoria's Secret,� but it also shows
that <i>he did not therefore form any different impression of the store that
his wife and daughter had patronized.</i> There is a complete absence of
evidence of any lessening of the capacity of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark to
identify and distinguish goods or services sold in Victoria's Secret stores or
advertised in its catalogs. The officer was offended by the ad, <i>but it did
not change his conception of Victoria's Secret.</i> His offense was directed
entirely at [the Moseleys], not at [Victoria's Secret]. Moreover, the expert
retained by respondents had nothing to say about the impact of [the Moseleys']
name on the strength of [Victoria's Secret's] mark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Moseley,</i> 537 U.S. at 434, 123 S.Ct. 1115
(emphases added).<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In short, Victoria's Secret has presented <i>no</i>
probative evidence that anyone is likely to think less of Victoria's Secret as
a result of �Victor's Little Secret� and cannot therefore prevail on its claim
of dilution by tarnishment. <i>See Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods.,
Inc.,</i> 73 F.3d 497, 507 (2d Cir.1996) (�Absent any showing that Henson's use
[of a puppet named Spa'am] will create negative associations with the SPAM
mark, there [is] little likelihood of dilution.�). Instead of developing a
record on remand that contains at least some evidence that Victoria's Secret's
reputation is likely to suffer because of the negative response that �Victor's
Little Secret� engendered, the record before the panel indicates only that a
single individual thinks poorly of �Victor's Little Secret.� <i>See Moseley,</i>
537 U.S. at 434, 123 S.Ct. 1115. On this record, it is simply no more probable
that Victoria's Secret will suffer reputational harm as a result of the
Moseleys' use of �Victor's Little Secret� than it is probable that those who
are offended by �Victor's Little Secret� will limit their negative impressions
to the Moseleys and refrain from projecting those negative associations upon
Victoria's Secret. Baker's affidavit does nothing to contradict this
conclusion, and given the absence of any indication that his or his family's
opinion of Victoria's Secret changed following the Moseleys' use of �Victor's
Little Secret,� his affidavit may, in fact, provide evidence that individuals
are likely to confine their distaste to the Moseleys. <i>See id.</i> (�The
officer was offended by the ad, but it did not change his conception of
Victoria's Secret. His offense was directed entirely at [the Moseleys], not at
[Victoria's Secret].�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Certainly, it is <i>possible</i> that the Moseleys'
use of �Victor's Little Secret� to sell adult-oriented material and other
novelties could reflect poorly on the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark and could cause
Victoria's Secret to suffer damage to its �sexy and playful� reputation, but
the evidentiary standard set forth in the statute is one of likelihood <i>not</i>
mere possibility. Likelihood is based on probable consequence and amounts to
more than simple speculation as to what might possibly happen. <i>See</i>
McCarthy on Trademarks � 24:115 n. 2 (indicating that � �likelihood� in the
dilution part of the Lanham Act has the same meaning as it does in the
traditional infringement sections of the Lanham Act: as synonymous with
�probability� �); <i>see also Parks v. LaFace Records,</i> 329 F.3d 437, 446
(6th Cir.2003) (�A �likelihood� means a �probability� rather than a
�possibility� of confusion.�). Yet, as the majority notes, on the instant
record, the �tarnishing effect of the Moseley's mark on the senior mark� is
nothing more than �speculative.� Maj. Op. at 388&#8211;89.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Despite the absence of evidence, the majority is
willing to assume that Victoria's Secret has met its burden to prove the
essential element of �harm to reputation� based on the fact that numerous cases
from other jurisdictions conclude, without much inquiry, �that a famous mark is
tarnished when its mark is semantically associated with a new mark that is used
to sell sex-related products.� <i>Id.</i> at 388. I do not agree. Although it
is true that courts have concluded that a finding of tarnishment is likely when
a mark's �likeness is placed in the context of sexual activity, obscenity, or
illegal activity,� <i>Hormel Foods Corp.,</i> 73 F.3d at 507, a court cannot
ignore the showing of reputational harm that the statute requires.<a

plainly unwholesome when compared to Victoria's Secret and that this case is
completely analogous to those cases on which the majority relies, I still
maintain that it is improper simply to assume likelihood of harm to the
reputation of a senior mark when dealing with a junior mark of sexual
character. As recounted above, there is <i>no</i> evidence connecting Victor's
Little Secret's �unwholesome� or �tawdry� sexual character to the senior mark's
reputation, and there is nothing in the language of the TDRA that would allow
the court to forgive a party's obligation present proof as to an element of the
tarnishment cause of action&#8212;i.e., the likelihood of harm to reputation.<a

evidence of harm to the reputation of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark based solely
on the sexual nature of the junior mark, the majority sanctions an almost
non-existent evidentiary standard and, in the process, essentially eliminates
the requirement that a plaintiff provide some semblance of proof of likelihood
of reputational harm in order to prevail on a tarnishment claim, despite the
plain language of 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2). Because I believe that Victoria's

goods?&nbsp; Otherwise, how would that expression qualify as a �mark or trade
name�?&nbsp; Notwithstanding Congress�s deletion of the reference to
�designation of source,� it would appear that the statutory language of the
TDRA still requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant�s alleging
infringing expression constitutes a trademark, i.e., a designation of source,
for the defendant�s goods.&nbsp; <i>See</i> Burstein, at 1224.&nbsp; For this
reason, a t-shirt of bumper sticker that states �Wal-Mart is Evil�, though
certainly tarnishing, would not be prohibited under the TDRA unless the
plaintiff can show that consumers perceive this phrase as a trademark.&nbsp; <i>See</i>

blurring also includes the �mark or trade name� language, should the same use
as a mark requirement apply to blurring as well?&nbsp; For a view that both
blurring and tarnishment under the TDRA include a requirement that the
defendant be shown to be making a �trademark use,� see Stacey L. Dogan &amp;

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three main methods by which a trademark owner may
seek to prevent third-party unauthorized uses of its trademark as part of an

a likelihood of confusion under Lanham Act �&nbsp;32 or � 43(a); (2) the
trademark owner can bring a cause of action for �cybersquatting� under Lanham

<p class=Centered>BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=Centered>I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the Internet is on its way to becoming a
familiar aspect in our daily lives, it is well to begin with a brief
explanation of how it works. The Internet is a network of computers that allows
a user to gain access to information stored on any other computer on the
network. Information on the Internet is lodged on files called web pages, which
can include printed matter, sound, pictures, and links to other web pages. An
Internet user can move from one page to another with just the click of a mouse.<a
href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[100]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Web pages are designated by an address called a
domain name. A domain name consists of two parts: a top level domain and a
secondary level domain. The top level domain is the domain name's suffix.
Currently, the Internet is divided primarily into six top level domains: (1)
.edu for educational institutions; (2) .org for non-governmental and
non-commercial organizations; (3) .gov for governmental entities; (4) .net for
networks; (5) .com for commercial users, and (6) a nation-specific domain,
which is .us in the United States. The secondary level domain is the remainder
of the address, and can consist of combinations of letters, numbers, and some
typographical symbols.<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[101]</span></span></span></a>
To take a simple example, in the domain name �cnn.com,� cnn (�Cable News
Network�) represents the secondary level domain and .com represents the top
level domain. Each domain name is unique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Over the last few years, the commercial side of the
Internet has grown rapidly. Web pages are now used by companies to provide
information about their products in a much more detailed fashion than can be
done through a standard advertisement. Moreover, many consumers and businesses
now order goods and services directly from company web pages. Given that
Internet sales are paperless and have lower transaction costs than other types
of retail sales, the commercial potential of this technology is vast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For consumers to buy things or gather information
on the Internet, they need an easy way to find particular companies or brand
names. The most common method of locating an unknown domain name is simply to
type in the company name or logo with the suffix .com.<a href="#_ftn102"
name="_ftnref102" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[102]</span></span></span></a> If this proves
unsuccessful, then Internet users turn to a device called a search engine.<a
href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[103]</span></span></span></a> A search engine will find
all web pages on the Internet with a particular word or phrase. Given the
current state of search engine technology, that search will often produce a
list of hundreds of web sites through which the user must sort in order to find
what he or she is looking for. As a result, companies strongly prefer that
their domain name be comprised of the company or brand trademark and the suffix
.com. <i>See </i>H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, at 5 (1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Until recently, domain names with the .com top
level domain could only be obtained from Network Solutions, Inc. (�NSI�). Now
other registrars may also assign them. But all these registrars grant such
names primarily on a first-come, first-served basis upon payment of a small
registration fee. They do not generally inquire into whether a given domain
name request matches a trademark held by someone other than the person
requesting the name. <i>See id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Due to the lack of any regulatory control over
domain name registration, an Internet phenomenon known as �cybersquatting� has
become increasingly common in recent years.<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[104]</span></span></span></a>
<i>See, e.g., Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen,</i> 141 F.3d 1316 (9th
Cir.1998). Cybersquatting involves the registration as domain names of
well-known trademarks by non-trademark holders who then try to sell the names
back to the trademark owners. Since domain name registrars do not check to see
whether a domain name request is related to existing trademarks, it has been
simple and inexpensive for any person to register as domain names the marks of
established companies. This prevents use of the domain name by the mark owners,
who not infrequently have been willing to pay �ransom� in order to get �their
names� back. <i>See </i>H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, at 5-7; S.Rep. No. 106-140, at
4-7 (1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>II</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Sportsman's is a mail order catalog company that is
quite well-known among pilots and aviation enthusiasts for selling products
tailored to their needs. In recent years, Sportsman's has expanded its catalog
business well beyond the aviation market into that for tools and home
accessories. The company annually distributes approximately 18 million catalogs
nationwide, and has yearly revenues of about $50 million. Aviation sales
account for about 60% of Sportsman's revenue, while non-aviation sales comprise
the remaining 40%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the 1960s, Sportsman's began using the logo �<i>sporty</i>
� to identify its catalogs and products. In 1985, Sportsman's registered the
trademark <i>sporty's</i> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Since then, Sportsman's has complied with all statutory requirements to
preserve its interest in the <i>sporty's</i> mark. <i>Sporty's</i> appears on
the cover of all Sportsman's catalogs; Sportsman's international toll free
number is 1-800-4<i>sportys;</i> and one of Sportsman's domestic toll free
phone numbers is 1-800-<i>Sportys.</i> Sportsman's spends about $10 million per
year advertising its <i>sporty's</i> logo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Omega is a mail order catalog company that sells
mainly scientific process measurement and control instruments. In late 1994 or
early 1995, the owners of Omega, Arthur and Betty Hollander, decided to enter
the aviation catalog business and, for that purpose, formed a wholly-owned
subsidiary called Pilot's Depot, LLC (�Pilot's Depot�). Shortly thereafter,
Omega registered the domain name sportys.com with NSI. Arthur Hollander was a
pilot who received Sportsman's catalogs and thus was aware of the <i>sporty's</i>
trademark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In January 1996, nine months after registering
sportys.com, Omega formed another wholly-owned subsidiary called Sporty's Farm
and sold it the rights to sportys.com for $16,200. Sporty's Farm grows and
sells Christmas trees, and soon began advertising its Christmas trees on a
sportys.com web page. When asked how the name Sporty's Farm was selected for
Omega's Christmas tree subsidiary, Ralph S. Michael, the CEO of Omega and
manager of Sporty's Farm, explained, as summarized by the district court, that</p>

<p class=Blockquote>in his own mind and among his family, he always thought of
and referred to the Pennsylvania land where Sporty's Farm now operates as <i>Spotty's
farm.</i> The origin of the name ... derived from a childhood memory he had of
his uncle's farm in upstate New York. As a youngster, Michael owned a dog named
Spotty. Because the dog strayed, his uncle took him to his upstate farm.
Michael thereafter referred to the farm as Spotty's farm. The name Sporty's
Farm was ... a subsequent derivation.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>Joint Appendix (�JA�) at 277 (emphasis added). There
is, however, no evidence in the record that Hollander was considering starting
a Christmas tree business when he registered sportys.com or that Hollander was
ever acquainted with Michael's dog Spotty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In March 1996, Sportsman's discovered that Omega
had registered sportys.com as a domain name. Thereafter, and before Sportsman's
could take any action, Sporty's Farm brought this declaratory action seeking
the right to continue its use of sportys.com. Sportsman's counterclaimed and
also sued Omega as a third-party defendant for, <i>inter alia,</i> (1)
trademark infringement, (2) trademark dilution pursuant to the FTDA, and (3)
unfair competition under state law. Both sides sought injunctive relief to
force the other to relinquish its claims to sportys.com. While this litigation
was ongoing, Sportsman's used �sportys-catalogs.com� as its primary domain
name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After a bench trial, the court rejected Sportsman's
trademark infringement claim and all related claims that are based on a
�likelihood of [consumer] confusion� since �the parties operate wholly
unrelated businesses [and t]herefore, confusion in the marketplace is not
likely to develop.�<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[105]</span></span></span></a>
<i>Id.</i> at 282-83. But on Sportsman's trademark dilution action, where a
likelihood of confusion was not necessary, the district court found for
Sportsman's. The court concluded (1) that <i>sporty's</i> was a <i>famous</i>
mark entitled to protection under the FTDA since �the �<i>Sporty's</i> � mark
enjoys general name recognition in the consuming public,� <i>id.</i> at 288,
and (2) that Sporty's Farm and Omega had diluted <i>sporty's</i> because
�registration of the �sportys.com� domain name effectively compromises
Sportsman's Market's ability to identify and distinguish its goods on the
Internet .... [by] preclud[ing] Sportsman's Market from using its �unique
identifier,� � <i>id.</i> at 289. The court also held, however, that
Sportsman's could only get injunctive relief and was not entitled to �punitive
damages ... profits, and attorney's fees and costs� pursuant to the FTDA since
Sporty Farm and Omega's conduct did not constitute willful dilution under the
FTDA.<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[106]</span></span></span></a>
<i>Id.</i> at 292-93.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court then issued an injunction
forcing Sporty's Farm to relinquish all rights to sportys.com. And Sportsman's
subsequently acquired the domain name. Both Sporty's Farm and Sportsman's
appeal.<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[107]</span></span></span></a>
Specifically, Sporty's Farm appeals the judgment insofar as the district court
granted an injunction in favor of Sportsman's for the use of the domain name.
Sportsman's, on the other hand, in addition to urging this court to affirm the
district court's injunction, cross-appeals, quite correctly as a procedural
matter, the district court's denial of damages under�the FTDA�. <i>See</i> 16A
Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice
and Procedure</i> � 3974.4 (3d ed.1999) (�[A] cross-appeal is required to
support modification of the judgment....�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> As we noted above, while this appeal was pending,
Congress passed the ACPA. That law was passed �to protect consumers and
American businesses, to promote the growth of online commerce, and to provide
clarity in the law for trademark owners by prohibiting the bad-faith and
abusive registration of distinctive marks as Internet domain names with the
intent to profit from the goodwill associated with such marks&#8212;a practice
commonly referred to as �cybersquatting�.� S.Rep. No. 106-140, at 4. In
particular, Congress viewed the legal remedies available for victims of
cybersquatting before the passage of the ACPA as �expensive and uncertain.�
H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, at 6. The Senate made clear its view on this point:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>While the [FTDA] has been useful in pursuing
cybersquatters, cybersquatters have become increasingly sophisticated as the
case law has developed and now take the necessary precautions to insulate
themselves from liability. For example, many cybersquatters are now careful to
no longer offer the domain name for sale in any manner that could implicate
liability under existing trademark dilution case law. And, in cases of
warehousing and trafficking in domain names, courts have sometimes declined to
provide assistance to trademark holders, leaving them without adequate and
effective judicial remedies. This uncertainty as to the trademark law's
application to the Internet has produced inconsistent judicial decisions and
created extensive monitoring obligations, unnecessary legal costs, and
uncertainty for consumers and trademark owners alike.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>S.Rep. No. 106-140, at 7. In short, the ACPA was passed
to remedy the perceived shortcomings of applying the FTDA in cybersquatting
cases such as this one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The new act accordingly amends the Trademark Act of
1946, creating a specific federal remedy for cybersquatting. New 15 U.S.C. �
1125(d)(1)(A) reads:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>A person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of
a mark, including a personal name which is protected as a mark under this
section, if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that
person-</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark,
including a personal name which is protected as a mark under this section; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name
that&#8212;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(I) in the case of a mark that is
distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name, is identical or
confusingly similar to that mark;</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='text-indent:.3in'>(II) in the case of a famous mark
that is famous at the time of registration of the domain name, is identical or
confusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark; ...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Act further provides that �a court may order
the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain
name to the owner of the mark,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(C), if the domain name
was �registered before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act,�
Pub.L. No. 106-113, � 3010. It also provides that damages can be awarded for
violations of the Act,<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[108]</span></span></span></a>
but that they are not �available with respect to the registration, trafficking,
or use of a domain name that occurs before the date of the enactment of this
Act.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case has three distinct features that are
worth noting before we proceed further. First, our opinion appears to be the
first interpretation of the ACPA at the appellate level. Second, we are asked
to undertake the interpretation of this new statute even though the district
court made its ruling based on the FTDA. Third, the case before us presents a
factual situation that, as far as we can tell, is rare if not unique: A
Competitor X of Company Y has registered Y's trademark as a domain name and
then transferred that name to Subsidiary Z, which operates a business wholly
unrelated to Y. These unusual features counsel that we decide no more than is
absolutely necessary to resolve the case before us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>A. Application of the ACPA to this Case</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The first issue before us is whether the ACPA
governs this case. The district court based its holding on the FTDA since the
ACPA had not been passed when it made its decision. Because the ACPA became law
while this case was pending before us, we must decide how its passage affects
this case. As a general rule, we apply the law that exists at the time of the
appeal. <i>See, e.g., Hamm v. City of Rock Hill,</i> 379 U.S. 306, 312-13, 85
S.Ct. 384, 13 L.Ed.2d 300 (1964) (� �[I]f subsequent to the judgment and before
the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes
the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied.� �
(quoting <i>United States v. Schooner Peggy,</i> 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 103, 110, 2
L.Ed. 49 (1801))).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But even if a new law controls, the question
remains whether in such circumstances it is more appropriate for the appellate
court to apply it directly or, instead, to remand to the district court to
enable that court to consider the effect of the new law. We therefore asked for
additional briefing from the parties regarding the applicability of the ACPA to
the case before us. After receiving those briefs and fully considering the
arguments there made, we think it is clear that the new law was adopted
specifically to provide courts with a preferable alternative to stretching
federal dilution law when dealing with cybersquatting cases. Indeed, the new
law constitutes a particularly good fit with this case. Moreover, the findings
of the district court, together with the rest of the record, enable us to apply
the new law to the case before us without difficulty. Accordingly, we will do
so and forego a remand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. �Distinctive� or �Famous�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Under the new Act, we must first determine whether <i>sporty's</i>
is a distinctive or famous mark and thus entitled to the ACPA's protection. <i>See</i>
15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I), (II). The district court concluded that <i>sporty's</i>
is both distinctive and famous. We agree that <i>sporty's</i> is a
�distinctive� mark. As a result, and without casting any doubt on the district
court's holding in this respect, we need not, and hence do not, decide whether <i>sporty's</i>
is also a �famous� mark.<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109" title=""><span

that focuses on �the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and
channels of trade used by the marks' owner and the person against whom the
injunction is sought.� <i>Id. </i>at � 1125(c)(1)(F). Sporty's Farm contends
that, although <i>sporty's</i> is a very well-known mark in the pilot and
aviation niche market, Sportsman's did not (and could not) prove that the mark
was well-known to <i>Sporty's Farm's</i> customers. We need not reach this
question, as we would have had to do under the FTDA, since the ACPA provides
protection not only to famous marks but also to distinctive marks regardless of
fame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Distinctiveness refers to inherent qualities of a
mark and is a completely different concept from fame. A mark may be distinctive
before it has been used-when its fame is nonexistent. By the same token, even a
famous mark may be so ordinary, or descriptive as to be notable for its lack of
distinctiveness. <i>See Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc.,</i> 191 F.3d 208,
215-26 (2d Cir.1999). We have no doubt that <i>sporty's,</i> as used in
connection with Sportsman's catalogue of merchandise and advertising, is
inherently distinctive. Furthermore, Sportsman's filed an affidavit under 15
U.S.C. � 1065 that rendered its registration of the <i>sporty's</i> mark
incontestable, which entitles Sportsman's �to a presumption that its registered
trademark is inherently distinctive.� <i>Equine Technologies, Inc. v.
Equitechnology, Inc.,</i> 68 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.1995). We therefore
conclude that, for the purposes of � 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I), the <i>sporty's</i>
mark is distinctive.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>C. �Identical and Confusingly Similar�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The next question is whether domain name
sportys.com is �identical or confusingly similar to� the <i>sporty's</i> mark.<a

1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I). As we noted above, apostrophes cannot be used in domain
names. <i>See supra</i> note 2. As a result, the secondary domain name in this
case (sportys) is indistinguishable from the Sportsman's trademark (<i>sporty's</i>
). <i>Cf. Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.,</i>
174 F.3d 1036, 1055 (9th Cir.1999) (observing that the differences between the
mark �MovieBuff� and the domain name �moviebuff.com� are �inconsequential in
light of the fact that Web addresses are not caps-sensitive and that the �.com�
top-level domain signifies the site's commercial nature�). We therefore
conclude that, although the domain name sportys.com is not precisely identical
to the <i>sporty's</i> mark, it is certainly �confusingly similar� to the
protected mark under � 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I). <i>Cf. Wella Corp. v. Wella
Graphics, Inc.</i> 874 F.Supp. 54, 56 (E.D.N.Y.1994) (finding the new mark
�Wello� confusingly similar to the trademark �Wella�).</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>D. �Bad Faith Intent to Profit�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We next turn to the issue of whether Sporty's Farm
acted with a �bad faith intent to profit� from the mark <i>sporty's</i> when it
registered the domain name sportys.com. 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(A)(i). The
statute lists nine factors to assist courts in determining when a defendant has
acted with a bad faith intent to profit from the use of a mark.<a
href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[111]</span></span></span></a> But we are not limited to
considering just the listed factors when making our determination of whether
the statutory criterion has been met. The factors are, instead, expressly
described as indicia that �may� be considered along with other facts. <i>Id.</i>
� 1125(d)(1)(B)(i).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We hold that there is more than enough evidence in
the record below of �bad faith intent to profit� on the part of Sporty's Farm
(as that term is defined in the statute), so that �no reasonable factfinder
could return a verdict against� Sportsman's. <i>Norville v. Staten Island Univ.
Hosp.,</i> 196 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.1999). First, it is clear that neither
Sporty's Farm nor Omega had any intellectual property rights in sportys.com at
the time Omega registered the domain name. <i>See id. </i>�
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(I). Sporty's Farm was not formed until nine months after the
domain name was registered, and it did not begin operations or obtain the
domain name from Omega until after this lawsuit was filed. Second, the domain
name does not consist of the legal name of the party that registered it, Omega.
<i>See id.</i> � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(II). Moreover, although the domain name does
include part of the name of Sporty's Farm, that entity did not exist at the
time the domain name was registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The third factor, the prior use of the domain name
in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services, also cuts
against Sporty's Farm since it did not use the site until after this litigation
began, undermining its claim that the offering of Christmas trees on the site
was in good faith. <i>See id.</i> � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(III). Further weighing in
favor of a conclusion that Sporty's Farm had the requisite statutory bad faith
intent, as a matter of law, are the following: (1) Sporty's Farm does not claim
that its use of the domain name was �noncommercial� or a �fair use of the
mark,� <i>see id.</i> � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV), (2) Omega sold the mark to
Sporty's Farm under suspicious circumstances, <i>see Sporty's Farm v.
Sportsman's Market,</i> No. 96CV0756 (D.Conn. Mar. 13, 1998), <i>reprinted in</i>
Joint Appendix at A277 (describing the circumstances of the transfer of
sportys.com); 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VI), and, (3) as we discussed above,
the <i>sporty's</i> mark is undoubtedly distinctive, <i>see id.</i> �
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IX).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The most important grounds for our holding that
Sporty's Farm acted with a bad faith intent, however, are the unique
circumstances of this case, which do not fit neatly into the specific factors
enumerated by Congress but may nevertheless be considered under the statute. We
know from the record and from the district court's findings that Omega planned
to enter into direct competition with Sportsman's in the pilot and aviation
consumer market. As recipients of Sportsman's catalogs, Omega's owners, the
Hollanders, were fully aware that <i>sporty's</i> was a very strong mark for
consumers of those products. It cannot be doubted, as the court found below,
that Omega registered sportys.com for the primary purpose of keeping
Sportsman's from using that domain name. Several months later, and after this
lawsuit was filed, Omega created another company in an unrelated business that
received the name Sporty's Farm so that it could (1) use the sportys.com domain
name in some commercial fashion, (2) keep the name away from Sportsman's, and
(3) protect itself in the event that Sportsman's brought an infringement claim
alleging that a �likelihood of confusion� had been created by Omega's version
of cybersquatting. Finally, the explanation given for Sporty's Farm's desire to
use the domain name, based on the existence of the dog Spotty, is more amusing
than credible. Given these facts and the district court's grant of an equitable
injunction under the FTDA, there is ample and overwhelming evidence that, as a
matter of law, Sporty's Farm's acted with a �bad faith intent to profit� from
the domain name sportys.com as those terms are used in the ACPA.<a

Corp.,</i> 110 F.3d 210, 214 (2d Cir.1997) (stating that, as a matter of law,
judgment may be granted where �the evidence in favor of the movant is so
overwhelming that �reasonable and fair minded [persons] could not arrive at a
verdict against [it].� � (quoting <i>Cruz v. Local Union No. 3,</i> 34 F.3d 1148,
1154 (2d Cir.1994) (alteration in original))).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>E. Remedy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Based on the foregoing, we hold that under �
1125(d)(1)(A), Sporty's Farm violated Sportsman's statutory rights by its use
of the sportys.com domain name. The question that remains is what remedy is
Sportsman's entitled to. The Act permits a court to �order the forfeiture or
cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to the owner
of the mark,� � 1125(d)(1)(C) for any �domain name [ ] registered before, on,
or after the date of the enactment of [the] Act,� Pub.L. No. 106-113, � 3010.
That is precisely what the district court did here, albeit under the
pre-existing law, when it directed a) Omega and Sporty's Farm to release their
interest in sportys.com and to transfer the name to Sportsman's, and b)
permanently enjoined those entities from taking any action to prevent and/or
hinder Sportsman's from obtaining the domain name. That relief remains
appropriate under the ACPA. We therefore affirm the district court's grant of
injunctive relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court then determined that Sportsman�s was not
entitled to damages under the ACPA because the Act states that damages are not
�available with respect to the registration, trafficking, or use of a domain
name that occurs before the date of the enactment of this Act.�&nbsp; The court
also affirmed as not clearly in error the district court�s determination that
Sporty�s Farm had not sought willfully to dilute Sportsman�s mark and thus that
Sportsman�s was not entitled to damages under the antidilution provisions of
Lanham Act � 43(c)</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Christopher Lamparello appeals the district court's
order enjoining him from maintaining a gripe website critical of Reverend Jerry
Falwell. For the reasons stated below, we reverse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Reverend Falwell is �a nationally known minister
who has been active as a commentator on politics and public affairs.� <i>Hustler
Magazine v. Falwell,</i> 485 U.S. 46, 47, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988).
He holds the common law trademarks �Jerry Falwell� and �Falwell,� and the
registered trademark �Listen America with Jerry Falwell.� Jerry Falwell
Ministries can be found online at �www.falwell.com,� a website which receives
9,000 hits (or visits) per day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Lamparello registered the domain name
�www.fallwell.com� on February 11, 1999, after hearing Reverend Falwell give an
interview �in which he expressed opinions about gay people and homosexuality
that [Lamparello] considered ... offensive.� Lamparello created a website at
that domain name to respond to what he believed were �untruths about gay
people.� Lamparello's website included headlines such as �Bible verses that Dr.
Falwell chooses to ignore� and �Jerry Falwell has been bearing false witness
(Exodus 20:16) against his gay and lesbian neighbors for a long time.� The site
also contained in-depth criticism of Reverend Falwell's views. For example, the
website stated:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Dr. Falwell says that he is on the side of truth. He says
that he will preach that homosexuality is a sin until the day he dies. But we
believe that if the reverend were to take another thoughtful look at the
scriptures, he would discover that they have been twisted around to support an
anti-gay political agenda ... at the expense of the gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>4</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the interior pages of Lamparello's website
did not contain a disclaimer, the homepage prominently stated, �This website is
NOT affiliated with Jerry Falwell or his ministry�; advised, �If you would like
to visit Rev. Falwell's website, you may click here�; and provided a hyperlink
to Reverend Falwell's website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At one point, Lamparello's website included a link
to the Amazon.com webpage for a book that offered interpretations of the Bible
that Lamparello favored, but the parties agree that Lamparello has never sold
goods or services on his website. The parties also agree that �Lamparello's
domain name and web site at www.fallwell.com,� which received only 200 hits per
day, �had no measurable impact on the quantity of visits to [Reverend
Falwell's] web site at www.falwell.com.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nonetheless, Reverend Falwell sent Lamparello
letters in October 2001 and June 2003 demanding that he cease and desist from
using www.fallwell.com or any variation of Reverend Falwell's name as a domain
name. Ultimately, Lamparello filed this action against Reverend Falwell and his
ministries (collectively referred to hereinafter as �Reverend Falwell�),
seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement. Reverend Falwell
counter-claimed, alleging trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. � 1114 (2000),
false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a), unfair competition under
15 U.S.C. � 1126 and the common law of Virginia,<a href="#_ftn113"

U.S.C. � 1125(d).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The parties stipulated to all relevant facts and
filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary
judgment to Reverend Falwell, enjoined Lamparello from using Reverend Falwell's
mark at www.fallwell.com, and required Lamparello to transfer the domain name
to Reverend Falwell. <i>Lamparello,</i> 360 F.Supp.2d at 773, 775. However, the
court denied Reverend Falwell's request for statutory damages or attorney fees,
reasoning that the �primary motive� of Lamparello's website was �to put forth
opinions on issues that were contrary to those of [Reverend Falwell]� and �not
to take away monies or to profit.� <i>Id.</i> at 775.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span

Reverend Falwell cross-appeals the denial of statutory damages and attorney

<p class=Centered>II.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span

trademark infringement and false designation of origin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Section 32 of the Lanham Act creates a cause of
action against:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[a]ny person who shall, without the consent of the
registrant-(a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or
colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering
for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in
connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1114(1). Similarly, Section 43(a) creates a
cause of action against:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>[a]ny person who, on or in connection with any goods or
services, ... uses in commerce any word ... [or] name ..., or any false
designation of origin, false <b>*313</b> or misleading description of fact, or
false or misleading representation of fact, which-(A) is likely to cause
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,
connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the
origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1125(a)(1)(A).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Both infringement and false designation of origin
have five elements. To prevail under either cause of action, the trademark
holder must prove:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(1) that it possesses a mark; (2) that the [opposing party]
used the mark; (3) that the [opposing party's] use of the mark occurred �in
commerce�; (4) that the [opposing party] used the mark �in connection with the
sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising� of goods or services;
and (5) that the [opposing party] used the mark in a manner likely to confuse
consumers.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 364 (citing 15 U.S.C. �� 1114,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Trademark law serves the important functions of
protecting product identification, providing consumer information, and
encouraging the production of quality goods and services. <i>See Qualitex Co.
v. Jacobson Prods. Co.,</i> 514 U.S. 159, 164, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 131 L.Ed.2d 248
(1995). But protections ��against unfair competition�� cannot be transformed
into � �rights to control language.� � <i>CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Skippy Inc.,</i>
214 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting Mark A. Lemley, <i>The Modern Lanham
Act and the Death of Common Sense,</i> 108 Yale L.J. 1687, 1710-11 (1999)).
�Such a transformation� would raise serious First Amendment concerns because it
would limit the</p>

<p class=Blockquote>ability to discuss the products or criticize the conduct of
companies that may be of widespread public concern and importance. Much useful
social and commercial discourse would be all but impossible if speakers were
under threat of an infringement lawsuit every time they made reference to a
person, company or product by using its trademark.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Lamparello and his amici argue at length that
application of the Lanham Act must be restricted to �commercial speech� to
assure that trademark law does not become a tool for unconstitutional
censorship. The Sixth Circuit has endorsed this view, <i>see Taubman Co. v.
Webfeats,</i> 319 F.3d 770, 774 (6th Cir.2003), and the Ninth Circuit recently
has done so as well, <i>see Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer,</i> 403 F.3d
672, 674 (9th Cir.2005).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In its two most significant recent amendments to
the Lanham Act, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (�FTDA�) and the
Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 (�ACPA�), Congress left
little doubt that it did not intend for trademark laws to impinge the First
Amendment rights of critics and commentators. The dilution statute applies to
only a �commercial use in commerce of a mark,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(1), and
explicitly states that the �[n]oncommercial use of a mark� is not actionable. <i>Id.</i>
� 1125(c)(4). Congress explained that this language was added to �adequately
address [ ] legitimate First Amendment concerns,� H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 4
(1995), <i>reprinted in</i> 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1031, and �incorporate[d]
the concept of �commercial� speech from the �commercial speech� doctrine.� <i>Id.</i>
at 8, <i>reprinted in</i> 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1035; <i>cf. Lorillard Tobacco
Co. v. Reilly,</i> 533 U.S. 525, 554, 121 S.Ct. 2404, 150 L.Ed.2d 532 (2001) (defining
commercial speech as �speech proposing a commercial transaction�) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, Congress directed that in
determining whether an individual has engaged in cybersquatting, the courts may
consider whether the person's use of the mark is a �bona fide noncommercial or
fair use.� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV). The legislature believed this
provision necessary to �protect[ ] the rights of Internet users and the
interests of all Americans in free speech and protected uses of trademarked
names for such things as parody, comment, criticism, comparative advertising,
news reporting, etc.� S.Rep. No. 106-140 (1999), 1999 WL 594571, at *8.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In contrast, the trademark infringement and false
designation of origin provisions of the Lanham Act (Sections 32 and 43(a),
respectively) do not employ the term �noncommercial.� They do state, however,
that they pertain only to the use of a mark �in connection with the sale,
offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services,� 15
U.S.C. � 1114(1)(a), or �in connection with any goods or services,� <i>id.</i>
� 1125(a)(1). But courts have been reluctant to define those terms narrowly.<a
href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[114]</span></span></span></a> Rather, as the Second Circuit
has explained, �[t]he term �services' has been interpreted broadly� and so
�[t]he Lanham Act has ... been applied to defendants furnishing a wide variety
of non-commercial public and civic benefits.� <i>United We Stand Am., Inc. v.
United We Stand, Am. N.Y., Inc.,</i> 128 F.3d 86, 89-90 (2d Cir.1997).
Similarly, in <i>PETA</i> we noted that a website need not actually sell goods
or services for the use of a mark in that site's domain name to constitute a
use � �in connection with� goods or services.� <i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 365; <i>see
also Taubman Co.,</i> 319 F.3d at 775 (concluding that website with <i>two</i>
links to websites of for-profit entities violated the Lanham Act).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, even if we accepted Lamparello's contention
that Sections 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act apply only to commercial speech,
we would still face the difficult question of what constitutes such speech
under those provisions. In the case at hand, we need not resolve that question
or determine whether Sections 32 and 43(a) apply exclusively to commercial
speech because Reverend Falwell's claims of trademark infringement and false
designation fail for a more obvious reason. The hallmark of such claims is a
likelihood of confusion&#8212;and there is no likelihood of confusion here.</p>

not cause confusion as to source is permissible.� <i>Dorr-Oliver, Inc. v.
Fluid-Quip, Inc.,</i> 94 F.3d 376, 380 (7th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Lamparello
can only be liable for infringement and false designation if his use of
Reverend Falwell's mark would be likely to cause confusion as to the source of
the website found at www.fallwell.com. This likelihood-of-confusion test �generally
strikes a comfortable balance� between the First Amendment and the rights of
markholders. <i>Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.,</i> 296 F.3d 894, 900 (9th
Cir.2002).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have identified seven factors helpful in
determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to the source of a
work, but �not all these factors are always relevant or equally emphasized in
each case.� <i>Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple,</i> 747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th
Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). The
factors are: �(a) the strength or distinctiveness of the mark; (b) the
similarity of the two marks; (c) the similarity of the goods/services the marks
identify; (d) the similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their
businesses; (e) the similarity of the advertising used by the two parties; (f)
the defendant's intent; (g) actual confusion.� <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Reverend Falwell's mark is distinctive, and the
domain name of Lamparello's website, www.fallwell.com, closely resembles it.
But, although Lamparello and Reverend Falwell employ similar marks online,
Lamparello's website looks nothing like Reverend Falwell's; indeed, Lamparello
has made no attempt to imitate Reverend Falwell's website. Moreover, Reverend
Falwell does not even argue that Lamparello's website constitutes advertising
or a facility for business, let alone a facility or advertising similar to that
of Reverend Falwell. Furthermore, Lamparello clearly created his website
intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Most importantly, Reverend Falwell and Lamparello
do not offer similar goods or services. Rather they offer opposing ideas and
commentary. Reverend Falwell's mark identifies his spiritual and political
views; the website at www.fallwell.com criticizes those very views. After even
a quick glance at the content of the website at www.fallwell.com, no one
seeking Reverend Falwell's guidance would be misled by the domain
name-www.fallwell.com-into believing Reverend Falwell authorized the content of
that website. No one would believe that Reverend Falwell sponsored a site criticizing
himself, his positions, and his interpretations of the Bible. <i>See New Kids
on the Block v. News Am. Publ'g, Inc.,</i> 971 F.2d 302, 308-09 (9th Cir.1992)
(stating that use of a mark to solicit criticism of the markholder implies the
markholder is not the sponsor of the use).<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Finally, the fact that people contacted Reverend
Falwell's ministry to report that they found the content at www.fallwell.com
antithetical to Reverend Falwell's views does not illustrate, as Reverend
Falwell claims, that the website engendered actual confusion. To the contrary,
the anecdotal evidence Reverend Falwell submitted shows that those searching
for Reverend Falwell's site and arriving instead at Lamparello's site quickly
realized that Reverend Falwell was <i>not</i> the source of the content
therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For all of these reasons, it is clear that the
undisputed record evidences no likelihood of confusion. In fact, Reverend
Falwell even conceded at oral argument that those viewing the content of
Lamparello's website probably were unlikely to confuse Reverend Falwell with
the source of that material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Nevertheless, Reverend Falwell argues that he is
entitled to prevail under the �initial interest confusion� doctrine. This
relatively new and sporadically applied doctrine holds that �the Lanham Act
forbids a competitor from luring potential customers away from a producer by
initially passing off its goods as those of the producer's, even if confusion
as to the source of the goods is dispelled by the time any sales are
consummated.� <i>Dorr-Oliver,</i> 94 F.3d at 382. According to Reverend
Falwell, this doctrine requires us to compare his mark with Lamparello's
website domain name, www.fallwell.com, <i>without</i> considering the content
of Lamparello's website. Reverend Falwell argues that some people who misspell
his name may go to www.fallwell.com assuming it is his site, thus giving
Lamparello an unearned audience-albeit one that quickly disappears when it
realizes it has not reached Reverend Falwell's site. This argument fails for
two reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, we have never adopted the initial interest
confusion theory; rather, we have followed a very different mode of analysis,
requiring courts to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists by
�examin[ing] the allegedly infringing use <i>in the context in which it is seen
by the ordinary consumer.</i>� <i>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. L &amp; L Wings,
Inc.,</i> 962 F.2d 316, 319 (4th Cir.1992) (emphasis added) (citing cases); <i>see
also What-A-Burger of Va., Inc. v. Whataburger, Inc.,</i> 357 F.3d 441, 450
(4th Cir.2004).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Contrary to Reverend Falwell's arguments, we did
not abandon this approach in <i>PETA.</i> Our inquiry in <i>PETA</i> was
limited to whether Doughney's use of the domain name �www.peta.org� constituted
a successful enough parody of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that
no one was likely to believe www.peta.org was sponsored or endorsed by that
organization. For a parody to be successful, it �must convey two
simultaneous-and contradictory-messages: that it is the original, but also that
it is <i>not</i> the original and is instead a parody.� <i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d
at 366 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Doughney argued that
his domain name conveyed the first message (that it was PETA's website) and
that the content of his website conveyed the requisite second message (that it
was not PETA's site). <i>Id.</i> Although �[t]he website's content ma[de] it
clear that it [wa]s not related to PETA,� <i>id.,</i> we concluded that the
website's content could not convey the requisite second message because the
site's content �[wa]s not conveyed <i>simultaneously</i> with the first
message, [i.e., the domain name itself,] as required to be considered a
parody.� <i>Id.</i> at 366. Accordingly, we found the �district court properly
rejected Doughney's parody defense.� <i>Id.</i> at 367.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>PETA</i> simply outlines the parameters of the
parody defense; it does not adopt the initial interest confusion theory or
otherwise diminish the necessity of examining context when determining whether
a likelihood of confusion exists. Indeed, in <i>PETA</i> itself, rather than
embracing a new approach, we reiterated that �[t]o determine whether a
likelihood of confusion exists, a court should not consider how closely a <i>fragment</i>
of a given use duplicates the trademark, but must instead consider <i>whether
the use in its entirety creates a likelihood of confusion.</i>� <i>Id.</i> at
366 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). When
dealing with domain names, this means a court must evaluate an allegedly
infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of the website
identified by the domain name.<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title=""><span

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>27</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, even if we did endorse the initial
interest confusion theory, that theory would not assist Reverend Falwell here
because it provides no basis for liability in circumstances such as these. The
few appellate courts that have followed the Ninth Circuit and imposed liability
under this theory for using marks on the Internet have done so only in cases
involving a factor utterly absent here-one business's use of another's mark for
its own financial gain. <i>See, e.g., PACCAR Inc. v. TeleScan Techs., L.L.C.,</i>
319 F.3d 243, 253 (6th Cir.2003); <i>Promatek Indus., Ltd. v. Equitrac Corp.,</i>
300 F.3d 808, 812 (7th Cir.2002); <i>Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West
Coast Entm't Corp.,</i> 174 F.3d 1036, 1055-56 (9th Cir.1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>28</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Profiting financially from initial interest
confusion is thus a key element for imposition of liability under this theory.<a
href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[117]</span></span></span></a> When an alleged infringer
does not compete with the markholder for sales, �some initial confusion will
not likely facilitate free riding on the goodwill of another mark, or otherwise
harm the user claiming infringement. Where confusion has little or no
meaningful effect in the marketplace, it is of little or no consequence in our
analysis.� <i>Checkpoint Sys.,</i> 269 F.3d at 296-97. For this reason, even
the Ninth Circuit has stated that a firm is not liable for using another's mark
in its domain name if it �could not financially capitalize on [a] misdirected
consumer [looking for the markholder's site] even if it so desired.� <i>Interstellar
Starship Servs., Ltd. v. Epix, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 936, 946 (9th Cir.2002).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This critical element&#8212;use of another firm's
mark to capture the markholder's customers and profits&#8212;simply does not
exist when the alleged infringer establishes a gripe site that criticizes the
markholder. <i>See</i> Hannibal Travis, <i>The Battle For Mindshare: The
Emerging Consensus that the First Amendment Protects Corporate Criticism and
Parody on the Internet,</i> 10 Va. J.L. &amp; Tech. 3, 85 (Winter 2005) (�The
premise of the �initial interest� confusion cases is that by using the
plaintiff's trademark to divert its customers, the defendant is engaging in the
old �bait and switch.� But because ... Internet users who find [gripe sites]
are not sold anything, the mark may be the �bait,� but there is simply no
�switch.� �) (citations omitted).<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title=""><span

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[118]</span></span></span></a>
Applying the initial interest confusion theory to gripe sites like Lamparello's
would enable the markholder to insulate himself from criticism-or at least to
minimize access to it. We have already condemned such uses of the Lanham Act,
stating that a markholder cannot � �shield itself from criticism by forbidding
the use of its name in commentaries critical of its conduct.� � <i>CPC Int'l,</i>
214 F.3d at 462 (quoting <i>L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc.,</i> 811
F.2d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1987)). �[J]ust because speech is critical of a
corporation and its business practices is not a sufficient reason to enjoin the
speech.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In sum, even if we were to accept the initial
interest confusion theory, that theory would not apply in the case at hand.
Rather, to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to the source
of a gripe site like that at issue in this case, a court must look not only to
the allegedly infringing domain name, but also to the underlying content of the
website. When we do so here, it is clear, as explained above, that no
likelihood of confusion exists. Therefore, the district court erred in granting
Reverend Falwell summary judgment on his infringement, false designation, and
unfair competition claims.</p>

<p class=Centered>III.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We evaluate Reverend Falwell's cybersquatting claim
separately because the elements of a cybersquatting violation differ from those
of traditional Lanham Act violations. To prevail on a cybersquatting claim,
Reverend Falwell must show that Lamparello: (1) �had a bad faith intent to
profit from using the [www.fallwell.com] domain name,� and (2) the domain name
www.fallwell.com �is identical or confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, the
distinctive and famous [Falwell] mark.� <i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 367 (citing 15
U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(A)).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> �The paradigmatic harm that the ACPA was enacted to
eradicate� is �the practice of cybersquatters registering several hundred
domain names in an effort to sell them to the legitimate owners of the mark.� <i>Lucas
Nursery &amp; Landscaping, Inc. v. Grosse,</i> 359 F.3d 806, 810 (6th
Cir.2004). The Act was also intended to stop the registration of multiple marks
with the hope of selling them to the highest bidder, �distinctive marks to
defraud consumers� or �to engage in counterfeiting activities,� and �well-known
marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain name to divert
customers from the mark owner's site to the cybersquatter's own site, many of
which are pornography sites that derive advertising revenue based on the number
of visits, or �hits,� the site receives.� S.Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571,
at *5-6. The Act was not intended to prevent �noncommercial uses of a mark,
such as for comment, criticism, parody, news reporting, etc.,� and thus they
�are beyond the scope� of the ACPA. <i>Id.</i> at *9.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To distinguish abusive domain name registrations
from legitimate ones, the ACPA directs courts to consider nine nonexhaustive
factors:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(I) the trademark or other intellectual property rights of
the person, if any, in the domain name;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(II) the extent to which the domain name consists of the
legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify
that person;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(III) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name in
connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(IV) the person's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of
the mark in a site accessible under the domain name;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(V) the person's intent to divert consumers from the mark
owner's online location to a site accessible under the domain name that could
harm the goodwill represented by the mark, either for commercial gain or with
the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of
confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the
site;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(VI) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise
assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain
without having used, or having an intent to use, the domain name in the bona
fide offering of any goods or services, or the person's prior conduct
indicating a pattern of such conduct;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(VII) the person's provision of material and misleading
false contact information when applying for the registration of the domain
name, the person's intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information,
or the person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(VIII) the person's registration or acquisition of multiple
domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to
marks of others that are distinctive at the time of the registration of such
domain names, or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time
of registration of such domain names, without regard to the goods or services
of the parties; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote>(IX) the extent to which the mark incorporated in the
person's domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous within
the meaning of subsection (c)(1) of this section.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i); <i>see also</i> H.R.Rep.
No. 106-412 (1999), 1999 WL 970519, at *10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> These factors attempt �to balance the property
interests of trademark owners with the legitimate interests of Internet users
and others who seek to make lawful uses of others' marks, including for
purposes such as comparative advertising, <i>comment, criticism,</i> parody,
news reporting, fair use, etc.� H.R. Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *10
(emphasis added). �The first four [factors] suggest circumstances that may tend
to indicate an absence of bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a
mark, and the others suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate that such
bad-faith intent exists.� <i>Id.</i> However, �[t]here is no simple formula for
evaluating and weighing these factors. For example, courts do not simply count
up which party has more factors in its favor after the evidence is in.� <i>Harrods
Ltd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names,</i> 302 F.3d 214, 234 (4th Cir.2002). In
fact, because use of these listed factors is permissive, �[w]e need not ...
march through� them all in every case. <i>Virtual Works, Inc. v. Volkswagen of
Am., Inc.,</i> 238 F.3d 264, 269 (4th Cir.2001). �The factors are given to
courts as a guide, not as a substitute for careful thinking about whether the
conduct at issue is motivated by a bad faith intent to profit.� <i>Lucas
Nursery &amp; Landscaping,</i> 359 F.3d at 811.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After close examination of the undisputed facts
involved in this case, we can only conclude that Reverend Falwell cannot
demonstrate that Lamparello �had a bad faith intent to profit from using the
[www.fallwell.com] domain name.� <i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 367. Lamparello
clearly employed www.fallwell.com simply to criticize Reverend Falwell's views.
Factor IV of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV), counsels against
finding a bad faith intent to profit in such circumstances because �use of a
domain name for purposes of ... comment, [and] criticism,� H.R.Rep. No.
106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, constitutes a �bona fide noncommercial or fair
use� under the statute, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV).<a href="#_ftn119"
name="_ftnref119" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[119]</span></span></span></a> That Lamparello provided a
link to an Amazon.com webpage selling a book he favored does not diminish the
communicative function of his website. The use of a domain name to engage in
criticism or commentary �even where done for profit� does not alone evidence a
bad faith intent to profit, H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, and
Lamparello did not even stand to gain financially from sales of the book at
Amazon.com. Thus factor IV weighs heavily in favor of finding Lamparello lacked
a bad faith intent to profit from the use of the domain name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Equally important, Lamparello has not engaged in
the type of conduct described in the statutory factors as typifying the bad
faith intent to profit essential to a successful cybersquatting claim. First,
we have already held, <i>supra</i> Part III.B, that Lamparello's domain name
does not create a likelihood of confusion as to source or affiliation.
Accordingly, Lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct-�creating a
likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or
endorsement of the site,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(V)-described as an
indicator of a bad faith intent to profit in factor V of the statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Factors VI and VIII also counsel against finding a
bad faith intent to profit here. Lamparello has made no attempt-or even
indicated a willingness-�to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name
to [Reverend Falwell] or any third party for financial gain.� 15 U.S.C. �
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VI). Similarly, Lamparello has not registered �multiple domain
names,� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VIII); rather, the record indicates he has
registered only one. Thus, Lamparello's conduct is not of the suspect variety
described in factors VI and VIII of the Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Notably, the case at hand differs markedly from
those in which the courts have found a bad faith intent to profit from domain
names used for websites engaged in political commentary or parody. For example,
in <i>PETA</i> we found the registrant of www.peta.org engaged in
cybersquatting because www.peta.org was one of <i>fifty</i> to <i>sixty</i>
domain names Doughney had registered, <i>PETA,</i> 263 F.3d at 362, and because
Doughney had evidenced a clear intent to sell www.peta.org to PETA, stating
that PETA should try to � �settle� with him and �make him an offer.� � <i>Id.</i>
at 368. <i>See also Virtual Works,</i> 238 F.3d at 269-70. Similarly, in <i>Coca-Cola
Co. v. Purdy,</i> 382 F.3d 774 (8th Cir.2004), the Eighth Circuit found an
anti-abortion activist who had registered domain names incorporating famous
marks such as �Washington Post� liable for cybersquatting because he had
registered almost <i>seventy</i> domain names, had offered to stop using the
Washington Post mark if the newspaper published an opinion piece by him on its
editorial page, and posted content that created a likelihood of confusion as to
whether the famous markholders sponsored the anti-abortion sites and �ha[d]
taken positions on hotly contested issues.� <i>Id.</i> at 786. In contrast,
Lamparello did not register multiple domain names, he did not offer to transfer
them for valuable consideration, and he did not create a likelihood of
confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Instead, Lamparello, like the plaintiffs in two
cases recently decided by the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, created a gripe site.
Both courts expressly refused to find that gripe sites located at domain names
nearly identical to the marks at issue violated the ACPA. In <i>TMI, Inc. v.
Maxwell,</i> 368 F.3d 433, 434-35 (5th Cir.2004), Joseph Maxwell, a customer of
homebuilder TMI, registered the domain name �www.trendmakerhome.com,� which
differed by only one letter from TMI's mark, TrendMaker Homes, and its domain
name, �www.trendmakerhomes.com.� Maxwell used the site to complain about his
experience with TMI and to list the name of a contractor whose work pleased
him. After his registration expired, Maxwell registered
�www.trendmakerhome.info.� TMI then sued, alleging cybersquatting. The Fifth
Circuit reversed the district court's finding that Maxwell violated the ACPA,
reasoning that his site was noncommercial and designed only �to inform
potential customers about a negative experience with the company.� <i>Id.</i>
at 438-39.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Similarly, in <i>Lucas Nursery &amp; Landscaping,</i>
a customer of Lucas Nursery registered the domain name �www.lucasnursery.com�
and posted her dissatisfaction with the company's landscaping services. Because
the registrant, Grosse, like Lamparello, registered a single domain name, the
Sixth Circuit concluded that her conduct did not constitute that which Congress
intended to proscribe-i.e., the registration of multiple domain names. <i>Lucas
Nursery &amp; Landscaping,</i> 359 F.3d at 810. Noting that Grosse's gripe site
did not create any confusion as to sponsorship and that she had never attempted
to sell the domain name to the markholder, the court found that Grosse's
conduct was not actionable under the ACPA. The court explained: �One of the
ACPA's main objectives is the protection of consumers from slick internet
peddlers who trade on the names and reputations of established brands. The
practice of informing fellow consumers of one's experience with a particular
service provider is surely not inconsistent with this ideal.� <i>Id.</i> at
811.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Like Maxwell and Grosse before him, Lamparello has
not evidenced a bad faith intent to profit under the ACPA. To the contrary, he
has used www.fallwell.com to engage in the type of �comment[ ][and] criticism�
that Congress specifically stated militates against a finding of bad faith
intent to profit. <i>See</i> S. Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571, at *14. And
he has neither registered multiple domain names nor attempted to transfer
www.fallwell.com for valuable consideration. We agree with the Fifth and Sixth
Circuits that, given these circumstances, the use of a mark in a domain name
for a gripe site criticizing the markholder does not constitute cybersquatting.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>What is the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution
Policy?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the UDRP
Policy) sets out the legal framework for the resolution of disputes between a
domain name registrant and a third party (i.e., a party other than the
registrar) over the abusive registration and use of an Internet domain name in
the generic top level domains or gTLDs (e.g., .biz, .com, .info, .mobi, .name,
.net, .org), and those country code top level domains or ccTLDs that have
adopted the UDRP Policy on a voluntary basis. At its meetings on August 25 and
26, 1999 in Santiago, Chile, the ICANN<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[121]</span></span></span></a>
Board of Directors adopted the UDRP Policy, based largely on the
recommendations contained in the Report of the WIPO Internet Domain Name
Process, as well as comments submitted by registrars and other interested
parties. All ICANN-accredited registrars that are authorized to register names
in the gTLDs and the ccTLDs that have adopted the Policy have agreed to abide
by and implement it for those domains. Any person or entity wishing to register
a domain name in the gTLDs and ccTLDs in question is required to consent to the
terms and conditions of the UDRP Policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>What are the advantages of the UDRP Administrative
Procedure?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main advantage of the UDRP Administrative Procedure is
that it typically provides a faster and cheaper way to resolve a dispute
regarding the registration and use of an Internet domain name than going to
court. In addition, the procedures are considerably more informal than litigation
and the decision-makers are experts in such areas as international trademark
law, domain name issues, electronic commerce, the Internet and dispute
resolution. It is also international in scope: it provides a single mechanism
for resolving a domain name dispute regardless of where the registrar or the
domain name holder or the complainant are located.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>What are the WIPO Center's fees for a domain name
dispute?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a case involving between 1 and 5 domain names, the fee
for a case that is to be decided by a single Panelist is USD1500 and USD4000
for a case that is to be decided by 3 Panelists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a case involving between 6 and 10 domain names, the fee
for a case that is to be decided by a single Panelist is USD2000 and USD5000
for a case that is to be decided by 3 Panelists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Complainant is responsible for paying the total fees.
The only time the Respondent has to share in the fees is when the Respondent
chooses to have the case decided by 3 Panelists and the Complainant had chosen
a single Panelist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In exceptional circumstances, either the Panel or the WIPO
Center may ask the parties to make additional payments to defray the costs of
the administrative procedure.</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</p>

<p class=OpinionCitation>(As Approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=1></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. <u>Purpose</u></b><span>.</span> This Uniform Domain
Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the &quot;Policy&quot;) has been adopted by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (&quot;ICANN&quot;), is
incorporated by reference into your Registration Agreement, and sets forth the
terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you and any party
other than us (the registrar) over the registration and use of an Internet
domain name registered by you. Proceedings under Paragraph 4 of this Policy
will be conducted according to the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy (the &quot;Rules of Procedure&quot;), which are available at
http://www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/uniform-rules.htm, and the selected
administrative-dispute-resolution service provider's supplemental rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=2></a><b>2. <u>Your Representations</u>.</b> By
applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a
domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the
statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and
accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not
infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are
not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not
knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or
regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name
registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=3></a><b>3. <u>Cancellations, Transfers, and Changes</u>.</b>
We will cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to domain name registrations
under the following circumstances:</p>

<p class=Blockquote><a name=3a></a>a. subject to the provisions of Paragraph 8,
our receipt of written or appropriate electronic instructions from you or your
authorized agent to take such action;</p>

<p class=Blockquote><a name=3b></a>b. our receipt of an order from a court or
arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such
action; and/or</p>

<p class=Blockquote><a name=3c></a>c. our receipt of a decision of an
Administrative Panel requiring such action in any administrative proceeding to
which you were a party and which was conducted under this Policy or a later
version of this Policy adopted by ICANN. (See Paragraph 4(i) and (k) below.)</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><a name=3End></a>We may also cancel, transfer or
otherwise make changes to a domain name registration in accordance with the
terms of your Registration Agreement or other legal requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=4></a><b>4. <u>Mandatory Administrative Proceeding</u>.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Paragraph sets forth the type of disputes for which you
are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding. These
proceedings will be conducted before one of the
administrative-dispute-resolution service providers listed at
www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/approved-providers.htm (each, a
&quot;Provider&quot;).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4a></a><b>a.
Applicable Disputes.</b> You are required to submit to a mandatory
administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a
&quot;complainant&quot;) asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with
the Rules of Procedure, that</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'><a name=4ai></a>(i) your domain
name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in
which the complainant has rights; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'><a name=4aii></a>(ii) you have no
rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'><a name=4aiii></a>(iii) your
domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.</p>

<p class=Blockquote style='margin-left:.6in'><a name=4aEnd></a>In the
administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three
elements are present.</p>

limitation, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the
registration and use of a domain name in bad faith:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4bi></a>(i)
circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the
domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise
transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner
of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for
valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs
directly related to the domain name; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4bii></a>(ii)
you have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the
trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain
name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4biii></a>(iii)
you have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the
business of a competitor; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4biv></a>(iv)
by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for
commercial gain, Internet users to your web site or other on-line location, by
creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the
source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location
or of a product or service on your web site or location.</p>

in Responding to a Complaint.</b> When you receive a complaint, you should
refer to Paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure in determining how your response
should be prepared. Any of the following circumstances, in particular but
without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation
of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate
interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4ci></a>(i)
before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable
preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name
in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4cii></a>(ii)
you (as an individual, business, or other organization) have been commonly
known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service
mark rights; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.6in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4ciii></a>(iii)
you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name,
without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to
tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4d></a><b>d.
Selection of Provider.</b> The complainant shall select the Provider from among
those approved by ICANN by submitting the complaint to that Provider. The
selected Provider will administer the proceeding, except in cases of
consolidation as described in Paragraph 4(f).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4e></a><b>e.
Initiation of Proceeding and Process and Appointment of Administrative Panel.</b>
The Rules of Procedure state the process for initiating and conducting a
proceeding and for appointing the panel that will decide the dispute (the
&quot;Administrative Panel&quot;).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4f></a><b>f.
Consolidation.</b> In the event of multiple disputes between you and a
complainant, either you or the complainant may petition to consolidate the
disputes before a single Administrative Panel. This petition shall be made to
the first Administrative Panel appointed to hear a pending dispute between the parties.
This Administrative Panel may consolidate before it any or all such disputes in
its sole discretion, provided that the disputes being consolidated are governed
by this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4g></a><b>g.
Fees.</b> All fees charged by a Provider in connection with any dispute before
an Administrative Panel pursuant to this Policy shall be paid by the
complainant, except in cases where you elect to expand the Administrative Panel
from one to three panelists as provided in Paragraph 5(b)(iv) of the Rules of
Procedure, in which case all fees will be split evenly by you and the
complainant.</p>

Administrative Panel. In addition, we will not be liable as a result of any
decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4i></a><b>i.
Remedies.</b> The remedies available to a complainant pursuant to any
proceeding before an Administrative Panel shall be limited to requiring the
cancellation of your domain name or the transfer of your domain name
registration to the complainant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4j></a><b>j.
Notification and Publication.</b> The Provider shall notify us of any decision
made by an Administrative Panel with respect to a domain name you have
registered with us. All decisions under this Policy will be published in full
over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines in an
exceptional case to redact portions of its decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=4k></a><b>k.
Availability of Court Proceedings.</b> The mandatory administrative proceeding
requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the
complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction
for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is
commenced or after such proceeding is concluded. If an Administrative Panel
decides that your domain name registration should be canceled or transferred,
we will wait ten (10) business days (as observed in the location of our
principal office) after we are informed by the applicable Provider of the
Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision. We will then
implement the decision unless we have received from you during that ten (10)
business day period official documentation (such as a copy of a complaint,
file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that you have commenced a lawsuit
against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has
submitted under Paragraph 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure. (In general,
that jurisdiction is either the location of our principal office or of your
address as shown in our Whois database. See Paragraphs 1 and 3(b)(xiii) of the
Rules of Procedure for details.) If we receive such documentation within the
ten (10) business day period, we will not implement the Administrative Panel's
decision, and we will take no further action, until we receive (i) evidence
satisfactory to us of a resolution between the parties; (ii) evidence
satisfactory to us that your lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii)
a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or ordering that you
do not have the right to continue to use your domain name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=5></a><b>5. <u>All Other Disputes and Litigation</u>.</b>
All other disputes between you and any party other than us regarding your
domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to the mandatory
administrative proceeding provisions of Paragraph 4 shall be resolved between
you and such other party through any court, arbitration or other proceeding
that may be available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=6></a><b>6. <u>Our Involvement in Disputes</u>.</b>
We will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any party
other than us regarding the registration and use of your domain name. You shall
not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such proceeding. In the
event that we are named as a party in any such proceeding, we reserve the right
to raise any and all defenses deemed appropriate, and to take any other action
necessary to defend ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=7></a><b>7. <u>Maintaining the Status Quo</u>.</b>
We will not cancel, transfer, activate, deactivate, or otherwise change the
status of any domain name registration under this Policy except as provided in
Paragraph 3 above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=8></a><b>8. <u>Transfers During a Dispute</u>.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=8a></a><b>a.
Transfers of a Domain Name to a New Holder.</b> You may not transfer your
domain name registration to another holder (i) during a pending administrative
proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15)
business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business)
after such proceeding is concluded; or (ii) during a pending court proceeding
or arbitration commenced regarding your domain name unless the party to whom
the domain name registration is being transferred agrees, in writing, to be
bound by the decision of the court or arbitrator. We reserve the right to
cancel any transfer of a domain name registration to another holder that is
made in violation of this subparagraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in'><a name=8b></a><b>b.
Changing Registrars.</b> You may not transfer your domain name registration to
another registrar during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant
to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in
the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is
concluded. You may transfer administration of your domain name registration to
another registrar during a pending court action or arbitration, provided that
the domain name you have registered with us shall continue to be subject to the
proceedings commenced against you in accordance with the terms of this Policy. In
the event that you transfer a domain name registration to us during the
pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute shall remain subject to
the domain name dispute policy of the registrar from which the domain name
registration was transferred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=9></a><b>9. <u>Policy Modifications</u>.</b> We
reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time with the permission of
ICANN. We will post our revised Policy at &lt;URL&gt; at least thirty (30)
calendar days before it becomes effective. Unless this Policy has already been
invoked by the submission of a complaint to a Provider, in which event the
version of the Policy in effect at the time it was invoked will apply to you
until the dispute is over, all such changes will be binding upon you with
respect to any domain name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose
before, on or after the effective date of our change. In the event that you
object to a change in this Policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain
name registration with us, provided that you will not be entitled to a refund
of any fees you paid to us. The revised Policy will apply to you until you
cancel your domain name registration</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Appealing a UDRP
decision</i>.&nbsp; As paragraph 4(k) of the UDRP makes clear, litigants
unsatisfied with the outcome of the UDRP process may �submit[] the dispute to a
court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution.�&nbsp; U.S. courts
afford no deference to UDRP decisions.&nbsp; <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>Barcelona.com,
Inc. v. Excelentisimo Ayntamiento De Barcelona</i>, 330 F.3d 617, 626 (4th Cir.

accessed the disputed domain name he was automatically re-directed to
&lt;planetshoes.com&gt; at which a site apparently operated by that company
offered for sale seven pictured models of shoes and boots. Each such
merchandise was identified as a Sporto product and Complainant's name and logo
(including a distinctive graphic design that is part of some of Complainant's
trademarks) is displayed prominently.<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123"

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The
Panel summarizes Complainant's contentions as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>1. Complainant
holds valid trademark rights in SPORTO by reason of its many USPTO-registered
marks. Except for the top-level domain .com the disputed domain name is
identical to these marks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>2. Complainant
has never authorized Respondent to use its marks. Respondent has never been
known by the disputed domain name. Respondent's current use of the disputed
domain name, to resolve to a site selling competitive products, is not
legitimate under the Policy. Respondent had constructive notice, and probably
actual notice as well, of Complainant's marks. These marks have been used
continuously in commerce for more than fifty years and have achieved widespread
fame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>3. Four factual
bases illustrate Respondent's bad faith in registration and use: (a) use of
Complainant's �clearly distinctive trademarks;� (b) Respondent's offer to sell
the disputed domain name for an amount far in excess of its costs of
registration; (c) Respondent's use of the disputed domain name for a
pay-per-click site with links related to Complainant's mark and products; and
(d) Respondent �can make no reasonable argument that its use is sports related
or related to any creative or commercial endeavor.�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>B. Respondent</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The
Panel summarizes Respondent's contentions as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>1. While
Respondent does not (and perforce cannot) directly contest identity of the
disputed domain name and Complainant's marks, it does deny any confusion and
notes that it has operated an active website at the disputed domain name for
thirteen years without complaint. Respondent also questions Complainant's right
to trademark protection for a �dictionary word.�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>2. Respondent
cites several legitimate uses in the thirteen years he has owned the disputed
domain name. In addition to the uses listed in Section 4, Respondent claims to
have operated a sports information service called Online Sports, and offers
what he describes as a business plan for this business dated September 1997.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>3. All of
Respondent's uses of the disputed domain name have been undertaken in good
faith and do not compete or interfere with Complainant. Respondent had no
knowledge of Complainant or its marks in 1997 when it registered the disputed
domain name. �Sporto� is a dictionary word in certain foreign languages and a
common colloquial word in English and Respondent chose it for that reason.</span></p>

a difficult case to resolve for several reasons, including a recent spate of

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>Complainant
has demonstrated longstanding trademark rights in the word SPORTO, and the
disputed domain name is identical to this term. When the two are identical no
showing of confusion is required. Complainant has carried its burden of proof
under this Policy head.</span></p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The
evidence shows that Respondent has used the disputed domain name sporadically
between 1997 and 2008 for businesses that do not compete with Complainant and
that such use in no way can be said to have played off any goodwill attaching
to Complainant's marks. Such use in the Panel's opinion does not establish that
Respondent is now or was ever �commonly known� by SPORTO (see Policy, paragraph
4(c)(ii)), but was under Policy precedent adequate to bring Respondent within
the safe harbor of paragraph 4(c)(i).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>So far
as the record reflects, however, all use since 2008 has not been legitimate; on
the contrary, it has been activity routinely found to be cybersquatting: a
standard pay-per-click page with hyperlinks based upon the mark owner's
(Complainant's) name and industry, followed by a site that purports to sell
Complainant's products or products directly competitive with Complainant's
products.</span></p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>As
discussed more fully in subsection C below, until last year Respondent's
pre-2008 use of the disputed domain name may have established a defense to the
charge of no rights or legitimate interest (although the absence of such <i>bona
fide</i> use today might nullify such defense for the purpose of the second
element of the Policy). Furthermore, recent cases that advance a different
approach to determination of bad faith under paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy
may also undercut that defense on the present facts. Because those cases
address Policy language regarding bad faith, the Panel will consider them under
that Policy head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>Until
last year's decision in <i>City Views Limited v. Moniker Privacy Services /
Xander, Jeduyu, ALGEBRALIVE</i>, WIPO Case No. D2009-0643 (�Mummygold�), panels
had considered the requirements of �registration and use� to be conjunctive,
requiring a panel to consider both bad faith first at the date of registration,
and to examine whether the respondent's use was in bad faith. To establish
registration in bad faith the complainant ordinarily must have proven that the
respondent, <i>at the time of registration</i>, knew of the complainant and its
mark <i>and</i> selected the mark to take advantage of whatever renown attached
to that mark. These cases generally (although not always) involved separate
analyses of facts pertaining to different points in time. Cases in which clear
bad faith use was shown absent a showing of bad faith registration still
resulted in a denial of the complaint because there was no evidence of (or
sufficient grounds from which to infer) knowledge and targeting at the time of
registration. This two-pronged approach became well-settled precedent. While
not expressly included in the WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP
Questions (�WIPO Overview�), paragraph 3.1 impliedly adopts it:</span></p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�3.1 Can bad faith be found if the disputed domain
name was registered before the trademark was registered/common law trademark
rights were acquired?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent><i>Consensus view</i>: Normally speaking, when a
domain name is registered before a trademark right is established, the
registration of the domain name was not in bad faith because the registrant
could not have contemplated the complainant's non-existent right.� (Citations

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span

The most cited example of this is <i>Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear
Marshmallows,</i> WIPO Case No. D2000-0003, in which bad faith in registration
was inferred from a combination of the respondent's selection of a famous and
distinctive mark and lengthy non-use of the domain name. Some of the other
bases for an inference of bad faith are set out in <i>Net2phone Inc v. Delta
Three Inc.</i>, WIPO Case No. D2007-0644, fn. 5-11 and accompanying text. All

panels who decided <i>Mummygold</i> and its progeny, however, advance a
different view of paragraph 4(a)(iii), and treat �registered and used the
domain name in bad faith� as a �unified concept�. Under this method of analysis
(the �<i>Mummygold</i> approach�) a panel may determine that registration in
bad faith under paragraph 4(a)(iii) may be established �retroactively� by
subsequent bad faith use. (<i>Mummygold</i>; <i>Octogen</i>)</span></p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The <i>Mummygold</i>
cases cite two Policy provisions in support of this approach. The first is a
registrant's representation and warranty in paragraph 2:</span></p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�2. Your Representations. By applying to register a
domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration,
you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in
your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge,
the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate
the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for
an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in
violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is your responsibility to
determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone
else's rights.�</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The <i>Octogen</i>
panel interpreted this paragraph as follows: �this provision not only imposes a
duty on the part of the registrant to conduct an investigation at the time of
registration, but also includes a representation and warranty by the registrant
that it will not now <i>or in the future </i>use the domain name in violation
of any laws or regulations. This effectively imposes on the registrant a
continuing duty to ensure that the domain name is not used in violation of
another's rights and clearly covers intellectual property rights and the laws
protecting them, including copyright and trademark. This representation and
warranty is not limited to the moment at which the registrant registers the
domain name; rather, it extends to any use of the domain name in the future.�

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The
second Policy underpinning is the set of non-exclusive examples of �evidence of
registration and use in bad faith� set out in paragraph 4(b) of the Policy. The
first three of these refer only to registration; the fourth refers only to use.
Again quoting from <i>Octogen</i>, �Under paragraph 4(b)(iv) of the Policy a
respondent that uses the domain name to attract Internet users to its website
or online location by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's
mark and its sponsorship of the website is acting in bad faith, without
reference to the respondent's state of mind at the time that the registrant
registered the domain name. Clearly, as under the <i>Telstra</i> analysis, in
this Panel's view bad faith registration can be deemed to have occurred even
without regard to the state of mind of the registrant at the time of
registration, if the domain name is subsequently used to trade on the goodwill
of the mark holder, just as bad faith use can occur without regard to the fact
that the domain name at issue has not been (or has been �passively') used.�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The <i>Mummygold</i>
approach has not to date been universally accepted. The panel in <i>Validas,
LLC v. SMVS Consultancy Private Limited</i>, WIPO Case No. D2009-1413, ably
critiques, and declines to follow, the <i>Mummygold</i> approach. This Panel
views <i>Mummygold</i>'s unified concept notion with skepticism. As this Panel
sees it, the argument that paragraph 2 places upon a registrant a continuous
obligation to avoid �infringing� use is to some extent inconsistent with
ordinary principles of contract law. Representations and warranties are usually
one-off statements, made as of a particular date. They may be repeated, to be
sure, and they may impose upon their maker a continuing obligation. In this
Panel's view, however, extending paragraph 2 to impose upon a registrant an
affirmative duty continuously to monitor (for example) subsequently issued
trademarks and modify website content accordingly would run counter to several
principles that underscore the UDRP system, most notably simplicity and
limiting use of the Policy to a narrow class of cases in which cybersquatting
has been proven. To this Panel it seems that, taken to an extreme the <i>Mummygold</i>
approach might without any action by the registrant render illegitimate (for
purposes of the Policy) an activity at a website that had been in use for years
without grounds for complaint &#8211; a result that would go farther than
United States trademark law. More importantly, that result might clash with
other express Policy provisions, such as certain of the safe-harbor provisions
of paragraph 4(a)(ii) and 4(c).</span></p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>In this
Panel's assessment, the most formidable obstacle to the <i>Mummygold</i>
approach is the language of paragraph 4(a)(iii) itself. The operative verbs in
that provision are clearly conjunctive &#8211; registered <i>and</i> used. The
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), when it adopted
the Policy and the Rules, apparently made a conscious decision at the time of
adoption to require two distinct �infringing� acts. (To be sure, that decision
was taken at a time when the Policy was a new instrument, and without the
benefit of hindsight of ten years of its subsequent operation.) The two
distinct inquiries required under the UDRP have been criticized as a
shortcoming that can countenance unscrupulous conduct, and has led in a few
cases to a respondent that engaged in abusive use getting away with it because
of insufficient proof of abusive registration. Several subsequently adopted
Policy counterparts have declined to require bad faith in both registration and
use for transfer.<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" title=""><span

formidable an obstacle, in this Panel's opinion, is the (until recently)
unbroken line of precedent, starting with some of the earliest cases decided
under the Policy and followed regularly to the present, that has interpreted
paragraph 4(a)(iii) as clearly and unequivocally requiring a showing of both
registration and use. Development of a body of Policy panel �jurisprudence� has
been a commendable objective in which much effort has and continues to be
invested; see, e.g., WIPO Overview, paragraph 4.1 (emphasis supplied):</span></p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�<i>Consensus view</i>: The UDRP does not operate on
a strict doctrine of precedent. However panels consider it desirable that their
decisions are consistent with prior panel decisions dealing with similar fact
situations. This ensures that the UDRP system operates in a fair, effective and

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>As this
Panel sees it, whether intended or not, the <i>Mummygold</i> approach could
impact an otherwise settled rule of decision on which �all parties� have relied
for a decade. That rule of decision moreover defines a fundamental element of
the Policy, and departing from our precedent in this matter could modify
substantially Complainant's burden of proof especially under the third element
of the Policy. That change in some cases could be the equivalent of an
amendment to the Policy, in effect comparable to substitution of �or� for �and�
in paragraph 4(a)(iii), that would result in changes in some subsequent cases.<a

fully extended (assuming a complainant had proven the other elements of the Policy)
it might result in transfer of a domain name without any action by its owner,
simply because someone subsequently acquired or registered a trademark. It
could encourage mark owners to overreach in Policy proceedings, something the
traditional approach discourages. It could cause substantial changes to those
who have built businesses in buying and selling domain names relying upon our
precedent. They are among the �all parties� entitled to �a fair, effective and
predictable manner� of resolution of Policy disputes. Substantially for the
reasons expressed by the <i>Validas</i> panel, and those listed above, this

bad faith in paragraph 4(b) of the Policy, as automatically establishing bad

language of paragraph 4(a)(iii) could be too easily circumvented.� I shall go
farther here: unless bad faith use subsequently to registration forms a basis

conjunctive language of paragraph 4(a)(iii) is plain. Equally clear, on this

applicability as a matter of contract. A registrant provides his undertaking
�By applying to register a domain name, or by asking [a registrar] to maintain
or renew a domain name registration.� This, unlike the covenant-type
interpretation necessary for the <i>Mummygold</i> approach, is a typical
one-time representation as of a discrete date, or rather successive discrete
dates. Paragraph 2 does not distinguish among the initial date of registration
and subsequent requests for renewal &#8211; the undertaking by its terms
applies as of all such dates.</span></p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�Does the renewal of the registration of a domain
name amount to a registration for the purposes of determining whether the
domain name was registered in bad faith?</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>Consensus view: While the transfer of a domain name
to a third party does amount to a new registration, a mere renewal of a domain
name does not amount to registration for the purposes of determining bad faith.
Registration in bad faith must occur at the time the current registrant took
possession of the domain name.�</p>

first case setting out this view is <i>Teradyne, Inc.Teradyne, Inc. [sic] v.
4Tel Technology</i>, WIPO Case No. D2000-0026. The panel in <i>Teradyne</i>
held that the conjunctive nature of paragraph 4(a)(iii) trumped the
introductory clause of paragraph 2. Unlike separate analyses of registration
and use, there have been comparatively few subsequent cases expressly
addressing this question. All this Panel has found have followed the <i>Teradyne</i>

Panel in <i>PAA Laboratories</i> did so however only in deference to Policy
precedent:</span></p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>�In making its finding, the Panel wishes to clarify
that its decision under this element is based on the need for consistency and
comity in domain name dispute �jurisprudence'. Were it not for the persuasive
force of the cited decisions, this Panel would have expressed the view that
paragraph 2 of the Policy demonstrates that references to �registration' in the
Policy were probably intended to be references to �registration' or �renewal of
registration.' Absent the consistency of approach which has found favour with
numerous earlier panels, this Panel would have seen no good reason for a
renewal not to be considered as equivalent to �registration' in the context of
the objectives of the Policy. If the renewal had not been effected the disputed
domain name would have lapsed and been available to others. The abusive
refreshing of the original registration is an act which this Panel considers
should be an act of a kind encompassed by paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy.
The benefit of an original good faith registration should not be perpetual to
the point where it can cloak successors in title and successors in �possession'
long after the original registration would have expired.�</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>This
Panel shares those reservations. For the reasons given in the last sentence of
the quotation from <i>PAA Laboratories</i>, I doubt that ICANN intended that
all renewals could be made without regard to a registrant's paragraph 2
undertaking. It is for that reason that panels (including this one) have in
some cases found a transfer of ownership even among related entities to be a
new or fresh registration for Policy purposes, see <i>ehotel AG v. Network
Technologies Polska Jasinski Lutoborski Sp.J</i>., WIPO Case No. D2009-0785
(�It might be argued that the conclusion in this case is unfair to Mr.
Lutoborski or the Respondent. If a respondent has registered a domain name for
a legitimate business purpose, and another business comes along that chooses to
use the same name, should he not be allowed to take advantage of that fact? The
answer to that question depends upon how exactly the domain name is used. If he
merely intends to continue to do what he has always legitimately done, then it
is difficult to see how that continued use could be characterised as use in bad
faith. The problem is that the Mr. Lutoborski did not do this. Instead, he

Panel's view, the facts and circumstances of the present case provide a more
compelling scenario than <i>PAA Laboratories</i> for revisiting the <i>Teradyne</i>
rule. There the respondent's use of the domain name changed because of changed
business circumstances (insolvency) not related to the domain name, and it
could have been argued that respondent's subsequent offer to sell it (the act
found to be use in bad faith) was part of the ordinary course of winding up the
earlier business. Here, at the time of its most recent renewal last year
Respondent's use of the disputed domain name had become prototypical
cybersquatting and in no way related to any of Respondent's businesses. The
change came about not through intervening circumstances unrelated to Respondent's
prior good faith use but by Respondent's conscious choice to change website
content. If Respondent's paragraph 2 representation and warranty were given in
October 2009 it would have been knowingly false. To summarize, in this Panel's
assessment:</span></p>

<p class=Blockquote>- Respondent intentionally changed its use of the disputed
domain name.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>- The new use is unrelated to Respondent's earlier
business.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>- The new use is textbook cybersquatting.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>- The new use occurred prior to the renewal held to be a
registration subject to for purposes of paragraph 4(a)(iii).</p>

<p class=Blockquote>- There has been no legitimate use since renewal.</p>

style='color:gray'>]</span> <span style='line-height:120%;color:black'>The
present case illustrates the problem that can arise from adhering rotely to <i>Teradyne</i>:
so long as a Respondent that originally registered a domain name in good faith
retains ownership it is free continuously and flagrantly to exploit
Complainant's trademark &#8211; license it to a competitor, perhaps &#8211;
without fear of a Policy proceeding. These consequences could of course be said
to flow in part from the conjunctive language of paragraph 4(a)(iii). Yet in
this Panel's considered opinion it is not unreasonable to temper those
consequences by giving the plain language of paragraph 2 equal standing with
the plain language of paragraph 4(a)(iii).</span></p>

though included as a Consensus View in the WIPO Overview this Panel's
assessment is that the <i>Teradyne</i> rule enjoys comparatively less
precedential support than the traditional rule of interpreting paragraph
4(a)(iii). As noted, the cases are few and most simply endorse the <i>Teredyne</i>
case without extended discussion, and the most thoughtful discussion, in <i>PAA
Laboratories</i>, questions the original rationale for the rule. This Panel's
qualifying its application in the stark circumstances of the present case
should have considerably less impact on UDRP proceedings and participants'
conduct than (for example) adopting the <i>Mummygold</i> approach.</span></p>

registration. In other circumstances it might well be appropriate to continue
to find otherwise �infringing� use still within the safe harbors of paragraphs
4(c)(i) or 4(c)(ii). The obvious case that comes to mind is when the respondent
had nothing to do with the intervening circumstances that changed things
&#8211; a trademark is registered after initial registration but before
renewal, and the use to which the respondent puts the domain name remains
materially unchanged, for example. That is a matter for panels in future cases.</span></p>

<h4><a name="_Toc392164842">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Uniform Rapid
Suspension System</a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2011, ICANN�s Board of Directors approved an enormous
expansion of the generic top-level domain (gTLD) system beyond the the 22 gTLDs<a
href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[128]</span></span></span></a> then operating.&nbsp; In
January, 2012, ICANN began accepting applications from private companies or
organizations that wished to administer new gTLDs consisting essentially of any
string of characters, including non-Latin characters.&nbsp; In October, 2013,
ICANN �delegated� the first new gTLDs: <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&#1588;&#1576;&#1603;&#1577;</span>
(Arabic for �web/network�, International Domain Registry Pty. Ltd),
&#1086;&#1085;&#1083;&#1072;&#1081;&#1085; (Cyrillic for �online�, CORE
Association), &#1089;&#1072;&#1081;&#1090; (Cyrillic for �site�, CORE
Association) and <span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:
"MS Gothic"'>&#28216;</span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:MingLiU'>&#25103;</span> (Chinese for �game(s)�, Spring Fields,
LLC).&nbsp; Since that date, ICANN has delegated over 600 new gTLDs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ICANN has established a sophisticated process very much akin
to a national trademark registration process for the evaluation of new gTLD
applications (which cost $185,000 per gTLD).&nbsp; Objections can be raised
against a new gTLD application on the ground, among others, that it conflicts
with preexisting trademark rights.&nbsp; Students wishing to know more about
this process should consult the <a
href="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/agb">ICANN <i>gTLD Applicant
Guidebook</i></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our focus here, however, is not on the implications for
trademark owners of the ICANN new gTLD delegation process (though those
implications can be profound), but rather on a new system by which trademark
owners can oppose the registration of second-level domains <i>within</i> these
new gTLDs.&nbsp; For example, if a third-party seeks to register the
second-level domain microsoft within the <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&#1588;&#1576;&#1603;&#1577;
gTLD,</span> (thus microsoft.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&#1588;&#1576;&#1603;&#1577;)</span>,
Microsoft may avail itself of a new means of opposing the registration that is
even faster and less expensive that the UDRP.&nbsp; This new process, which
applies only to second-level domains within new gTLDs established since 2013,
is the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS).&nbsp; Students wishing to read
the URS Procedure may find the document at <a
href="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/urs">http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/urs</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The URS is designed for especially clear, essentially
�slam-dunk� cases of bad faith second-level domain registration.&nbsp; The URS
specifies that the complainant must show:</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[1] that the registered domain name is identical or
confusingly similar to a word mark: (i) for which the Complainant holds a valid
national or regional registration and that is in current use; or (ii) that has
been validated through court proceedings; or (iii) that is specifically
protected by a statute or treaty in effect at the time the URS complaint is
filed.</p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>a. Use can be shown by demonstrating that evidence of
use &#8212; which can be a declaration and one specimen of current use in
commerce &#8212; was submitted to, and validated by, the Trademark
Clearinghouse. </p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>b. Proof of use may also be submitted directly with
the URS Complaint. </p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>and </p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[2] that the Registrant has no legitimate right or
interest to the domain name; and </p>

<p class=Blockquoteindent>[3] that the domain was registered and is being used
in bad faith.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>URS, 1.2.6.1-1.2.6.3.&nbsp; Note that the complainant
must have a registered mark to avail itself of the URS.&nbsp; Otherwise, it
must use the UDRP.&nbsp; The URS Procedure explicitly states that �[t]he burden
of proof shall be clear and convincing evidence.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The URS process is very fast.&nbsp; The URS provider (such
as the National Arbitration Forum) must review the complaint within two
business days from the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; If the complaint complies
with all filing requirements, the URS provider notifies the relevant registry
operator, who must �lock� the targeted domain within 24 hours (locking a domain
in this context merely means that the registrant cannot make any changes to
registration data; the domain still resolves to a website).&nbsp; Within 24
hours of locking the domain, the registry operator must notify the registrant
of the complaint.&nbsp; The registrant then has 14 days to file a response of
no more than 2,500 words.&nbsp; If the registrant defaults on that 14 day
period, the registrant still has six months from the date of a Notice of
Default to reopen proceedings de novo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remedy available to the successful complainant is
suspension of the domain name and resolution of the domain to an informational
page stating that the domain name has been suspended after a URS
proceeding.&nbsp; Unlike the UDRP, the successful complainant cannot win
transfer of the domain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fee for a URS proceeding, which is conducted entirely
electronically and only in English, is $375 to $500, depending on the number of
domain names complained of.&nbsp; By comparison, UDRP filing fees start at
$1500.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>FINDINGS and DISCUSSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Complainant is Facebook Inc. which lists its
address as Menlo Park, CA, USA. Complainant states that since it began doing
business in 2004 it has become the world<b>�</b>s leading provider of online
social networking services with more than 1.11 billion registered users around
the world. Complainant also asserts that<b> �</b>it is ranked as the first most
visited website in the world, and has the second highest traffic in Slovakia
(where the Respondent is based).<b>� </b>Complainant owns numerous domestic and
international registrations for its FACEBOOK mark including; FACEBOOK -
Community Trade Mark No. 006455687 registered on 07 October 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span>&nbsp;Complainant contends that Respondent<b>�</b>s
domain name, &lt;facebok.pw&gt;, is confusingly similar to its FACEBOOK mark,
and was registered and is being used in bad faith by the Respondent who has no
rights or legitimate interests in the domain name.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Respondent is Radoslav Stach whose address is
listed as Presnov, Slovakia. Respondent registered the disputed domain name on
or about March 26, 2013. Respondent did not provide a response to the Complaint
in accordance with the URS rules of procedure; however Respondent did provide
correspondence which stated, �Im was offline, could you pleas tell me what I
have doing ? I want removed this domain from my account!�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>IDENTICAL OR CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The only difference between the Domain Name,
&lt;facebok.pw&gt;, and the Complainant's FACEBOOK mark is the absence of one
letter (�o�) in the Domain Name. In addition, it is well accepted that the top
level domain is irrelevant in assessing identity or confusing similarity, thus
the �.pw� is of no consequence here. The Examiner finds that the Domain Name is
confusingly similar to Complainant�s FACEBOOK mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>NO RIGHTS OR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To the best of the Complainant�s knowledge, the
Respondent does not have any rights in the name FACEBOOK or �facebok� nor is
the Respondent commonly known by either name. Complainant has not authorized
Respondent�s use of its mark and has no affiliation with Respondent. The Domain
Name points to a web page listing links for popular search topics which
Respondent appears to use to generate click through fees for Respondent�s
personal financial gain. Such use does not constitute a bona fide offering of
goods or services and wrongfully misappropriates Complainant�s mark�s goodwill.
The Examiner finds that the Respondent has established no rights or legitimate
interests in the Domain Name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>BAD FAITH REGISTRATION AND USE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Domain Name was registered and is being used in
bad faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Domain Name was registered on or about March
26, 2013, nine years after the Complainant's FACEBOOK marks were first used and
began gaining global notoriety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Examiner finds that the Respondent has engaged
in a pattern of illegitimate domain name registrations (See Complainant�s
exhibit URS Site Screenshot) whereby Respondent has either altered letters in,
or added new letters to, well-known trademarks. Such behavior supports a
conclusion of Respondent�s bad faith registration and use. Furthermore, the
Complainant submits that the Respondent is using the Domain Name in order to
attract for commercial gain Internet users to its parking website by creating a
likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship or affiliation of the
website. The Examiner finds such behavior to further evidence Respondent�s bad
faith registration and use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>DETERMINATION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> After reviewing the Complainant�s submissions, the
Examiner determines that the Complainant has demonstrated all three elements of
the URS by a standard of clear and convincing evidence; the Examiner hereby
Orders the following domain names be SUSPENDED for the duration of the
registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> eBay, Inc. (�eBay�), through its eponymous online
marketplace, has revolutionized the online sale of goods, especially used
goods. It has facilitated the buying and selling by hundreds of millions of
people and entities, to their benefit and eBay's profit. But that marketplace
is sometimes employed by users as a means to perpetrate fraud by selling
counterfeit goods.</p>

Company (together, �Tiffany�) have created and cultivated a brand of jewelry
bespeaking high-end quality and style. Based on Tiffany's concern that some use
eBay's website to sell counterfeit Tiffany merchandise, Tiffany has instituted
this action against eBay, asserting various causes of action-sounding in
trademark infringement, trademark dilution and false advertising-arising from
eBay's advertising and listing practices. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm
the district court's judgment with respect to Tiffany's claims of trademark
infringement and dilution but remand for further proceedings with respect to
Tiffany's false advertising claim.</p>

week-long bench trial, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (Richard J. Sullivan, <i>Judge</i>) set forth its findings
of fact and conclusions of law. <i>Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay, Inc.,</i> 576
F.Supp.2d 463 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (�<i>Tiffany</i>�). When reviewing a judgment
following a bench trial in the district court, we review the court's findings
of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <i>de novo. Giordano v.
Thomson,</i> 564 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.2009). Except where noted otherwise, we
conclude that the district court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous.

style='color:gray'>]</span> eBay generates revenue by charging sellers to use
its listing services. For any listing, it charges an �insertion fee� based on
the auction's starting price for the goods being sold and ranges from $0.20 to
$4.80. <i>Id.</i> For any completed sale, it charges a �final value fee� that
ranges from 5.25% to 10% of the final sale price of the item. <i>Id.</i>
Sellers have the option of purchasing, at additional cost, features �to
differentiate their listings, such as a border or bold-faced type.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> eBay also generates revenue through a company named
PayPal, which it owns and which allows users to process their purchases. PayPal
deducts, as a fee for each transaction that it processes, 1.9% to 2.9% of the
transaction amount, plus $0.30. <i>Id.</i> This gives eBay an added incentive
to increase both the volume and the price of the goods sold on its website. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Tiffany</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tiffany is a world-famous purveyor of, among other
things, branded jewelry. <i>Id.</i> at 471-72. Since 2000, all new Tiffany
jewelry sold in the United States has been available exclusively through
Tiffany's retail stores, catalogs, and website, and through its Corporate Sales
Department. <i>Id.</i> at 472-73. It does not use liquidators, sell overstock
merchandise, or put its goods on sale at discounted prices. <i>Id.</i> at 473.
It does not-nor can it, for that matter-control the �legitimate secondary
market in authentic Tiffany silvery jewelry,� i.e., the market for second-hand
Tiffany wares. <i>Id.</i> at 473. The record developed at trial �offere[d]
little basis from which to discern the actual availability of authentic Tiffany
silver jewelry in the secondary market.� <i>Id.</i> at 474.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Sometime before 2004, Tiffany became aware that
counterfeit Tiffany merchandise was being sold on eBay's site. Prior to and
during the course of this litigation, Tiffany conducted two surveys known as
�Buying Programs,� one in 2004 and another in 2005, in an attempt to assess the
extent of this practice. Under those programs, Tiffany bought various items on
eBay and then inspected and evaluated them to determine how many were
counterfeit. <i>Id.</i> at 485. Tiffany found that 73.1% of the purported
Tiffany goods purchased in the 2004 Buying Program and 75.5% of those purchased
in the 2005 Buying Program were counterfeit. <i>Id.</i> The district court
concluded, however, that the Buying Programs were �methodologically flawed and
of questionable value,� <i>id.</i> at 512, and �provide[d] limited evidence as
to the total percentage of counterfeit goods available on eBay at any given
time,� <i>id.</i> at 486. The court nonetheless decided that during the period
in which the Buying Programs were in effect, a �significant portion of the
�Tiffany� sterling silver jewelry listed on the eBay website ... was
counterfeit,� <i>id.,</i> and that eBay knew �that some portion of the Tiffany
goods sold on its website might be counterfeit,� <i>id.</i> at 507. The court
found, however, that �a substantial number of authentic Tiffany goods are
[also] sold on eBay.� <i>Id.</i> at 509.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>10</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Reducing or eliminating the sale of all second-hand
Tiffany goods, including genuine Tiffany pieces, through eBay's website would
benefit Tiffany in at least one sense: It would diminish the competition in the
market for genuine Tiffany merchandise. <i>See id.</i> at 510 n. 36 (noting
that �there is at least some basis in the record for eBay's assertion that one
of Tiffany's goals in pursuing this litigation is to shut down the legitimate
secondary market in authentic Tiffany goods�). The immediate effect would be
loss of revenue to eBay, even though there might be a countervailing gain by
eBay resulting from increased consumer confidence about the bona fides of other
goods sold through its website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Anti-Counterfeiting Measures</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>11</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because eBay facilitates many sales of Tiffany
goods, genuine and otherwise, and obtains revenue on every transaction, it
generates substantial revenues from the sale of purported Tiffany goods, some
of which are counterfeit. �eBay's Jewelry &amp; Watches category manager
estimated that, between April 2000 and June 2004, eBay earned $4.1 million in
revenue from completed listings with �Tiffany� in the listing title in the
Jewelry &amp; Watches category.� <i>Id.</i> at 481. Although eBay was
generating revenue from all sales of goods on its site, including counterfeit
goods, the district court found eBay to have �an interest in eliminating
counterfeit Tiffany merchandise from eBay ... to preserve the reputation of its
website as a safe place to do business.� <i>Id.</i> at 469. The buyer of fake
Tiffany goods might, if and when the forgery was detected, fault eBay. Indeed,
the district court found that �buyers ... complain[ed] to eBay� about the sale
of counterfeit Tiffany goods. <i>Id.</i> at 487. �[D]uring the last six weeks
of 2004, 125 consumers complained to eBay about purchasing �Tiffany� items
through the eBay website that they believed to be counterfeit.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Because eBay �never saw or inspected the
merchandise in the listings,� its ability to determine whether a particular
listing was for counterfeit goods was limited. <i>Id.</i> at 477-78. Even had
it been able to inspect the goods, moreover, in many instances it likely would
not have had the expertise to determine whether they were counterfeit. <i>Id.</i>
at 472 n. 7 (�[I]n many instances, determining whether an item is counterfeit
will require a physical inspection of the item, and some degree of expertise on
the part of the examiner.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Notwithstanding these limitations, eBay spent �as
much as $20 million each year on tools to promote trust and safety on its
website.� <i>Id.</i> at 476. For example, eBay and PayPal set up �buyer
protection programs,� under which, in certain circumstances, the buyer would be
reimbursed for the cost of items purchased on eBay that were discovered not to
be genuine. <i>Id.</i> at 479. eBay also established a �Trust and Safety�
department, with some 4,000 employees �devoted to trust and safety� issues,
including over 200 who �focus exclusively on combating infringement� and 70 who
�work exclusively with law enforcement.� <i>Id.</i> at 476.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> By May 2002, eBay had implemented a �fraud engine,�
�which is principally dedicated to ferreting out illegal listings, including
counterfeit listings.� <i>Id.</i> at 477. eBay had theretofore employed manual
searches for keywords in listings in an effort to �identify blatant instances
of potentially infringing ... activity.� <i>Id.</i> �The fraud engine uses
rules and complex models that automatically search for activity that violates
eBay policies.� <i>Id.</i> In addition to identifying items actually advertised
as counterfeit, the engine also incorporates various filters designed to screen
out less-obvious instances of counterfeiting using �data elements designed to
evaluate listings based on, for example, the seller's Internet protocol
address, any issues associated with the seller's account on eBay, and the
feedback the seller has received from other eBay users.� <i>Id.</i> In addition
to general filters, the fraud engine incorporates �Tiffany-specific filters,� including
�approximately 90 different keywords� designed to help distinguish between
genuine and counterfeit Tiffany goods. <i>Id.</i> at 491. During the period in
dispute,<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[131]</span></span></span></a>
eBay also �periodically conducted [manual] reviews of listings in an effort to
remove those that might be selling counterfeit goods, including Tiffany goods.�
<i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> For nearly a decade, including the period at issue,
eBay has also maintained and administered the �Verified Rights Owner (�VeRO�)
Program�-a � �notice-and-takedown� system� allowing owners of intellectual
property rights, including Tiffany, to �report to eBay any listing offering
potentially infringing items, so that eBay could remove such reported
listings.� <i>Id.</i> at 478. Any such rights-holder with a �good-faith belief
that [a particular listed] item infringed on a copyright or a trademark� could
report the item to eBay, using a �Notice Of Claimed Infringement form or NOCI
form.� <i>Id.</i> During the period under consideration, eBay's practice was to
remove reported listings within twenty-four hours of receiving a NOCI, but eBay
in fact deleted seventy to eighty percent of them within twelve hours of
notification. <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On receipt of a NOCI, if the auction or sale had
not ended, eBay would, in addition to removing the listing, cancel the bids and
inform the seller of the reason for the cancellation. If bidding had ended,
eBay would retroactively cancel the transaction. <i>Id.</i> In the event of a
cancelled auction, eBay would refund the fees it had been paid in connection
with the auction. <i>Id.</i> at 478-79.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In some circumstances, eBay would reimburse the
buyer for the cost of a purchased item, provided the buyer presented evidence
that the purchased item was counterfeit. <i>Id.</i> at 479.<a href="#_ftn132"
name="_ftnref132" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[132]</span></span></span></a> During the relevant time
period, the district court found, eBay �never refused to remove a reported
Tiffany listing, acted in good faith in responding to Tiffany's NOCIs, and
always provided Tiffany with the seller's contact information.� <i>Id.</i> at
488.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, it may be difficult for a purchaser to
proffer evidence to eBay supporting a suspicion that the �Tiffany� merchandise
he or she bought is counterfeit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In addition, eBay has allowed rights owners such as
Tiffany to create an �About Me� webpage on eBay's website �to inform eBay users
about their products, intellectual property rights, and legal positions.� <i>Id.</i>
at 479. eBay does not exercise control over the content of those pages in a
manner material to the issues before us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tiffany, not eBay, maintains the Tiffany �About Me�
page. With the headline �<b>BUYER BEWARE,</b>� the page begins: �<b>Most of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span

warning messages when a seller attempted to list a Tiffany item.� <i>Tiffany,</i>
576 F.Supp.2d at 491. These messages �instructed the seller to make sure that
the item was authentic Tiffany merchandise and informed the seller that eBay
�does not tolerate the listing of replica, counterfeit, or otherwise
unauthorized items' and that violation of this policy �could result in
suspension of [the seller's] account.� � <i>Id.</i> (alteration in original).
The messages also provided a link to Tiffany's �About Me� page with its �buyer

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span

transactions, eBay has also suspended from its website � �hundreds of thousands
of sellers every year,� tens of thousands of whom were suspected [of] having
engaged in infringing conduct.� <i>Id.</i> at 489. eBay primarily employed a �
�three strikes rule� � for suspensions, but would suspend sellers after the first
violation if it was clear that �the seller �listed a number of infringing
items,� and �[selling counterfeit merchandise] appears to be the only thing
they've come to eBay to do.� � <i>Id.</i> But if �a seller listed a potentially
infringing item but appeared overall to be a legitimate seller, the �infringing

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> By late 2006, eBay had implemented additional
anti-fraud measures: delaying the ability of buyers to view listings of certain
brand names, including Tiffany's, for 6 to 12 hours so as to give
rights-holders such as Tiffany more time to review those listings; developing
the ability to assess the number of items listed in a given listing; and
restricting one-day and three-day auctions and cross-border trading for some
brand-name items. <i>Id.</i> at 492.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>eBay's Advertising</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> At the same time that eBay was attempting to reduce
the sale of counterfeit items on its website, it actively sought to promote sales
of premium and branded jewelry, including Tiffany merchandise, on its site. <i>Id.</i>
at 479-80. Among other things,</p>

<p class=Blockquote>eBay �advised its sellers to take advantage of the demand
for Tiffany merchandise as part of a broader effort to grow the Jewelry &amp;
Watches category.� <i>Id.</i> at 479. And prior to 2003, eBay advertised the
availability of Tiffany merchandise on its site. eBay's advertisements
trumpeted �Mother's Day Gifts!,� Pl.'s Exs. 392, 1064, a �Fall FASHION BRAND
BLOWOUT,� Pl.'s Ex. 392, �Jewelry Best Sellers,� <i>id.,</i> �GREAT BRANDS,
GREAT PRICES,� Pl.'s Ex. 1064, or �Top Valentine's Deals,� Pl.'s Ex. 392, among
other promotions. It encouraged the viewer to �GET THE FINER THINGS.� Pl.'s Ex.
392. These advertisements provided the reader with hyperlinks, at least one of
each of which was related to Tiffany merchandise-�Tiffany,� �Tiffany &amp; Co.
under $150,� �Tiffany &amp; Co,� �Tiffany Rings,� or �Tiffany &amp; Co. under
$50.� Pl.'s Exs. 392, 1064.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>eBay also purchased sponsored-link advertisements on
various search engines to promote the availability of Tiffany items on its
website. <i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 480. In one such case, in the form of
a printout of the results list from a search on Yahoo! for �tiffany,� the

eBay told Tiffany that it had ceased buying sponsored links. <i>Tiffany,</i>

do so indirectly through a third party. <i>Id.</i></p>

facilitating and advertising the sale of �Tiffany� goods that turned out to be
counterfeit-constituted direct and contributory trademark infringement,
trademark dilution, and false advertising. On July 14, 2008, following a bench

clear error and its conclusions of law <i>de novo. Giordano v. Thomson,</i> 564
F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.2009).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>I. Direct Trademark Infringement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[<i>The court found that eBay did not directly infringe
Tiffany�s trademark when it used the mark on its website and when it purchased

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>II. Contributory Trademark Infringement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>29</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The more difficult issue, and the one that the
parties have properly focused our attention on, is whether eBay is liable for
contributory trademark infringement&#8212;i.e., for culpably facilitating the
infringing conduct of the counterfeiting vendors. Acknowledging the paucity of
case law to guide us, we conclude that the district court correctly granted
judgment on this issue in favor of eBay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>A. Principles</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>30</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Contributory trademark infringement is a judicially
created doctrine that derives from the common law of torts. <i>See, e.g., Hard
Rock Cafe Licensing Corp. v. Concession Servs., Inc.,</i> 955 F.2d 1143, 1148
(7th Cir.1992); <i>cf. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,</i>
545 U.S. 913, 930 (2005) (�[T]hese doctrines of secondary liability emerged
from common law principles and are well established in the law.�) (citations
omitted). The Supreme Court most recently dealt with the subject in <i>Inwood
Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844 (1982). There,
the plaintiff, Ives, asserted that several drug manufacturers had induced
pharmacists to mislabel a drug the defendants produced to pass it off as Ives'.
<i>See id.</i> at 847-50. According to the Court, �if a manufacturer or
distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it
continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is
engaging in trademark infringement, the manufacturer or distributor is
contributorially responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit.� <i>Id.</i>
at 854.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[134]</span></span></span></a>
The Court ultimately decided to remand the case to the Court of Appeals after
concluding it had improperly rejected factual findings of the district court
favoring the defendant manufacturers. <i>Id.</i> at 857-59.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>31</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> <i>Inwood</i>'s test for contributory trademark
infringement applies on its face to manufacturers and distributors of goods.
Courts have, however, extended the test to providers of services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>32</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The Seventh Circuit applied <i>Inwood</i> to a
lawsuit against the owner of a swap meet, or �flea market,� whose vendors were
alleged to have sold infringing Hard Rock Caf� T-shirts. <i>See Hard Rock Caf�,</i>
955 F.2d at 1148-49. The court �treated trademark infringement as a species of
tort,� <i>id.</i> at 1148, and analogized the swap meet owner to a landlord or
licensor, on whom the common law �imposes the same duty ... [as <i>Inwood</i> ]
impose[s] on manufacturers and distributors,� <i>id.</i> at 1149; <i>see also
Fonovisa, Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc.,</i> 76 F.3d 259 (9th Cir.1996)
(adopting <i>Hard Rock Cafe</i>'s reasoning and applying <i>Inwood</i> to a
swap meet owner).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>33</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Speaking more generally, the Ninth Circuit
concluded that <i>Inwood</i>'s test for contributory trademark infringement
applies to a service provider if he or she exercises sufficient control over
the infringing conduct. <i>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc.,</i>
194 F.3d 980, 984 (9th Cir.1999); <i>see also id.</i> (�Direct control and
monitoring of the instrumentality used by a third party to infringe the
plaintiff's mark permits the expansion of <i>Inwood Lab.</i>'s �supplies a
product� requirement for contributory infringement.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>34</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We have apparently addressed contributory trademark
infringement in only two related decisions, <i>see Polymer Tech. Corp. v.
Mimran,</i> 975 F.2d 58, 64 (2d Cir.1992) (�<i>Polymer I</i> �); <i>Polymer
Tech. Corp. v. Mimran,</i> 37 F.3d 74, 81 (2d Cir.1994) (�<i>Polymer II</i> �),
and even then in little detail. Citing <i>Inwood,</i> we said that �[a]
distributor who intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or
continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is
engaging in trademark infringement, is contributorially liable for any injury.�
<i>Polymer I,</i> 975 F.2d at 64.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>35</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The limited case law leaves the law of contributory
trademark infringement ill-defined. Although we are not the first court to
consider the application of <i>Inwood</i> to the Internet, <i>see, e.g.,
Lockheed,</i> 194 F.3d 980, <i>supra</i> (Internet domain name registrar), we
are apparently the first to consider its application to an online marketplace.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>B. Discussion</i></p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>1. Does Inwood Apply?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>36</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In the district court, the parties disputed whether
eBay was subject to the <i>Inwood</i> test. <i>See Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d
at 504. eBay argued that it was not because it supplies a service while <i>Inwood</i>
governs only manufacturers and distributors of products. <i>Id.</i> The
district court rejected that distinction. It adopted instead the reasoning of
the Ninth Circuit in <i>Lockheed</i> to conclude that <i>Inwood</i> applies to
a service provider who exercises sufficient control over the means of the
infringing conduct. <i>Id.</i> at 505-06. Looking �to the extent of the control
exercised by eBay over its sellers' means of infringement,� the district court
concluded that <i>Inwood</i> applied in light of the �significant control� eBay
retained over the transactions and listings facilitated by and conducted
through its website. <i>Id.</i> at 505-07.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>37</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On appeal, eBay no longer maintains that it is not
subject to <i>Inwood.</i><a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[136]</span></span></span></span></a>
We&nbsp; therefore assume without deciding that <i>Inwood</i>'s test for
contributory trademark infringement governs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>2. Is eBay Liable Under Inwood?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>38</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The question that remains, then, is whether eBay is
liable under the <i>Inwood</i> test on the basis of the services it provided to
those who used its website to sell counterfeit Tiffany products. As noted, when
applying <i>Inwood</i> to service providers, there are two ways in which a
defendant may become contributorially liable for the infringing conduct of
another: first, if the service provider �intentionally induces another to
infringe a trademark,� and second, if the service provider �continues to supply
its [service] to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in
trademark infringement.� <i>Inwood,</i> 456 U.S. at 854. Tiffany does not argue
that eBay induced the sale of counterfeit Tiffany goods on its website-the
circumstances addressed by the first part of the <i>Inwood</i> test. It argues
instead, under the second part of the <i>Inwood</i> test, that eBay continued
to supply its services to the sellers of counterfeit Tiffany goods while
knowing or having reason to know that such sellers were infringing Tiffany's
mark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>39</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court rejected this argument. First,
it concluded that to the extent the NOCIs that Tiffany submitted gave eBay
reason to know that particular listings were for counterfeit goods, eBay did
not continue to carry those listings once it learned that they were specious. <i>Tiffany,</i>
576 F.Supp.2d at 515-16. The court found that eBay's practice was promptly to
remove the challenged listing from its website, warn sellers and buyers, cancel
fees it earned from that listing, and direct buyers not to consummate the sale
of the disputed item. <i>Id.</i> at 516. The court therefore declined to hold
eBay contributorially liable for the infringing conduct of those sellers. <i>Id.</i>
at 518. On appeal, Tiffany does not appear to challenge this conclusion. In any
event, we agree with the district court that no liability arises with respect
to those terminated listings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>40</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tiffany disagrees vigorously, however, with the
district court's further determination that eBay lacked sufficient knowledge of
trademark infringement by sellers behind other, non-terminated listings to
provide a basis for <i>Inwood</i> liability. Tiffany argued in the district
court that eBay knew, or at least had reason to know, that counterfeit Tiffany
goods were being sold ubiquitously on its website. <i>Id.</i> at 507-08. As
evidence, it pointed to, <i>inter alia,</i> the demand letters it sent to eBay
in 2003 and 2004, the results of its Buying Programs that it shared with eBay,
the thousands of NOCIs it filed with eBay alleging its good faith belief that
certain listings were counterfeit, and the various complaints eBay received
from buyers claiming that they had purchased one or more counterfeit Tiffany
items through eBay's website. <i>Id.</i> at 507. Tiffany argued that taken
together, this evidence established eBay's knowledge of the widespread sale of
counterfeit Tiffany products on its website. Tiffany urged that eBay be held
contributorially liable on the basis that despite that knowledge, it continued
to make its services available to infringing sellers. <i>Id.</i> at 507-08.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>41</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court rejected this argument. It
acknowledged that �[t]he evidence produced at trial demonstrated that eBay had <i>generalized</i>
notice that some portion of the Tiffany goods sold on its website might be
counterfeit.� <i>Id.</i> at 507 (emphasis in original). The court characterized
the issue before it as �whether eBay's <i>generalized</i> knowledge of
trademark infringement on its website was sufficient to meet the �knowledge or
reason to know� prong of the <i>Inwood</i> test.� <i>Id.</i> at 508 (emphasis
in original). eBay had argued that �such generalized knowledge is insufficient,
and that the law demands more specific knowledge of individual instances of
infringement and infringing sellers before imposing a burden upon eBay to
remedy the problem.� <i>Id.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>42</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The district court concluded that �while eBay
clearly possessed general knowledge as to counterfeiting on its website, such
generalized knowledge is insufficient under the <i>Inwood</i> test to impose
upon eBay an affirmative duty to remedy the problem.� <i>Id.</i> at 508. The
court reasoned that <i>Inwood</i>'s language explicitly imposes contributory
liability on a defendant who �continues to supply its product [-in eBay's case,
its service-] to <i>one</i> whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in
trademark infringement.� <i>Id.</i> at 508 (emphasis in original). The court
also noted that plaintiffs �bear a high burden in establishing �knowledge� of
contributory infringement,� and that courts have</p>

<p class=Blockquote>been reluctant to extend contributory trademark liability
to defendants where there is some uncertainty as to the extent or the nature of
the infringement. In <i>Inwood,</i> Justice White emphasized in his concurring
opinion that a defendant is not �require[d] ... to refuse to sell to dealers
who merely <i>might</i> pass off its goods.�</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 508-09 (quoting <i>Inwood,</i> 456 U.S.
at 861, 102 S.Ct. 2182) (White, J., concurring) (emphasis and alteration in
original).<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>43</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, the district court concluded that for
Tiffany to establish eBay's contributory liability, Tiffany would have to show
that eBay �knew or had reason to know of specific instances of actual
infringement� beyond those that it addressed upon learning of them. <i>Id.</i>
at 510. Tiffany failed to make such a showing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>44</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On appeal, Tiffany argues that the distinction
drawn by the district court between eBay's general knowledge of the sale of
counterfeit Tiffany goods through its website, and its specific knowledge as to
which particular sellers were making such sales, is a �false� one not required
by the law. Appellants' Br. 28. Tiffany posits that the only relevant question
is �whether all of the knowledge, when taken together, puts [eBay] on notice
that there is a substantial problem of trademark infringement. If so and if it
fails to act, [eBay] is liable for contributory trademark infringement.� <i>Id.</i>
at 29.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>45</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We agree with the district court. For contributory
trademark infringement liability to lie, a service provider must have more than
a general knowledge or reason to know that its service is being used to sell
counterfeit goods. Some contemporary knowledge of which particular listings are
infringing or will infringe in the future is necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>46</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We are not persuaded by Tiffany's proposed
interpretation of <i>Inwood.</i> Tiffany understands the �lesson of <i>Inwood</i>
� to be that an action for contributory trademark infringement lies where �the
evidence [of infringing activity]-direct or circumstantial, taken as a
whole-... provide[s] a basis for finding that the defendant knew or should have
known that its product or service was being used to further illegal
counterfeiting activity.� Appellants' Br. 30. We think that Tiffany reads <i>Inwood</i>
too broadly. Although the <i>Inwood</i> Court articulated a �knows or has
reason to know� prong in setting out its contributory liability test, the Court
explicitly declined to apply that prong to the facts then before it. <i>See
Inwood,</i> 456 U.S. at 852 n. 12, 102 S.Ct. 2182 (�The District Court also
found that the petitioners did not continue to provide drugs to retailers whom
they knew or should have known were engaging in trademark infringement. The
Court of Appeals did not discuss that finding, and we do not address it.�)
(internal citation omitted). The Court applied only the inducement prong of the
test. <i>See id.</i> at 852-59.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>47</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We therefore do not think that <i>Inwood</i>
establishes the contours of the �knows or has reason to know� prong. Insofar as
it speaks to the issue, though, the particular phrasing that the Court
used-that a defendant will be liable if it �continues to supply its product to <i>one</i>
whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement,� <i>id.</i>
at 854, 102 S.Ct. 2182 (emphasis added)-supports the district court's
interpretation of <i>Inwood,</i> not Tiffany's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>48</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> We find helpful the Supreme Court's discussion of <i>Inwood</i>
in a subsequent <i>copyright</i> case, <i>Sony Corp. of America v. Universal
City Studios, Inc.,</i> 464 U.S. 417 (1984). There, defendant Sony manufactured
and sold home video tape recorders. <i>Id.</i> at 419. Plaintiffs Universal
Studios and Walt Disney Productions held copyrights on various television
programs that individual television-viewers had taped using the defendant's
recorders. <i>Id.</i> at 419-20. The plaintiffs contended that this use of the
recorders constituted copyright infringement for which the defendants should be
held contributorily liable. <i>Id.</i> In ruling for the defendants, the Court
discussed <i>Inwood</i> and the differences between contributory liability in
trademark versus copyright law.</p>

<p class=Blockquote>If <i>Inwood</i>'s<i> narrow standard</i> for contributory
trademark infringement governed here, [the plaintiffs'] claim of contributory
infringement would merit little discussion. Sony certainly does not
�intentionally induce[ ]� its customers to make infringing uses of [the
plaintiffs'] copyrights, nor does it supply its products to <i>identified
individuals known by it</i> to be engaging in continuing infringement of [the
plaintiffs'] copyrights.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id.</i> at 439 n. 19 (quoting <i>Inwood,</i> 456

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>49</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Thus, the Court suggested, had the <i>Inwood</i>
standard applied in <i>Sony,</i> the fact that Sony might have known that some
portion of the purchasers of its product used it to violate the copyrights of
others would not have provided a sufficient basis for contributory liability. <i>Inwood</i>'s
�narrow standard� would have required knowledge by Sony of �identified
individuals� engaging in infringing conduct. Tiffany's reading of <i>Inwood</i>
is therefore contrary to the interpretation of that case set forth in <i>Sony.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>50</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Although the Supreme Court's observations in <i>Sony,</i>
a copyright case, about the �knows or has reason to know� prong of the
contributory trademark infringement test set forth in <i>Inwood</i> were dicta,
they constitute the only discussion of that prong by the Supreme Court of which
we are aware. We think them to be persuasive authority here.<a href="#_ftn138"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>51</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Applying <i>Sony</i>'s interpretation of <i>Inwood,</i>
we agree with the district court that �Tiffany's general allegations of
counterfeiting failed to provide eBay with the knowledge required under <i>Inwood</i>.�
<i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 511. Tiffany's demand letters and Buying
Programs did not identify particular sellers who Tiffany thought were then
offering or would offer counterfeit goods. <i>Id.</i> at 511-13.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[139]</span></span></span></a> And although the NOCIs and
buyer complaints gave eBay reason to know that certain sellers had been selling
counterfeits, those sellers' listings were removed and repeat offenders were
suspended from the eBay site. Thus Tiffany failed to demonstrate that eBay was
supplying its service to individuals who it knew or had reason to know were
selling counterfeit Tiffany goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>52</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district
court insofar as it holds that eBay is not contributorially liable for
trademark infringement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>3. Willful Blindness.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>53</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Tiffany and its amici express their concern that if
eBay is not held liable except when specific counterfeit listings are brought
to its attention, eBay will have no incentive to root out such listings from
its website. They argue that this will effectively require Tiffany and
similarly situated retailers to police eBay's website-and many others like
it-�24 hours a day, and 365 days a year.� Council of Fashion Designers of
America, Inc. Amicus Br. 5. They urge that this is a burden that most mark
holders cannot afford to bear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>54</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> First, and most obviously, we are interpreting the
law and applying it to the facts of this case. We could not, even if we thought
it wise, revise the existing law in order to better serve one party's interests
at the expense of the other's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>55</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> But we are also disposed to think, and the record
suggests, that private market forces give eBay and those operating similar
businesses a strong incentive to minimize the counterfeit goods sold on their
websites. eBay received many complaints from users claiming to have been duped
into buying counterfeit Tiffany products sold on eBay. <i>Tiffany,</i> 576
F.Supp.2d at 487. The risk of alienating these users gives eBay a reason to
identify and remove counterfeit listings.<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[140]</span></span></span></a>
Indeed, it has spent millions of dollars in that effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>56</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Moreover, we agree with the district court that if
eBay had reason to suspect that counterfeit Tiffany goods were being sold
through its website, and intentionally shielded itself from discovering the
offending listings or the identity of the sellers behind them, eBay might very
well have been charged with knowledge of those sales sufficient to satisfy <i>Inwood</i>'s
�knows or has reason to know� prong. <i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 513-14. A
service provider is not, we think, permitted willful blindness. When it has
reason to suspect that users of its service are infringing a protected mark, it
may not shield itself from learning of the particular infringing transactions
by looking the other way. <i>See, e.g., Hard Rock Caf�,</i> 955 F.2d at 1149
(�To be willfully blind, a person must suspect wrongdoing and deliberately fail
to investigate.�); <i>Fonovisa, </i>76 F.3d at 265 (applying <i>Hard Rock Caf�</i>'s
reasoning to conclude that �a swap meet can not disregard its vendors' blatant
trademark infringements with impunity�).<a href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[141]</span></span></span></a>
In the words of the Seventh Circuit, �willful blindness is equivalent to actual
knowledge for purposes of the Lanham Act.� <i>Hard Rock Caf�,</i> 955 F.2d at
1149.<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>57</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> eBay appears to concede that it knew as a general
matter that counterfeit Tiffany products were listed and sold through its
website. <i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 514. Without more, however, this
knowledge is insufficient to trigger liability under <i>Inwood.</i> The
district court found, after careful consideration, that eBay was not willfully
blind to the counterfeit sales. <i>Id.</i> at 513. That finding is not clearly
erroneous.<a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[143]</span></span></span></a>
eBay did not ignore the information it was given about counterfeit sales on its
website.</p>

<p class=Centered><b>Questions and Comments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Tiffany</i>
court asserted that trademark law�s contributory infringement doctrine �derives
from the common law of torts.� In <i>Probabilistic Knowledge of Third-Party
Trademark Infringement</i>, 2011 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Stan.
Tech. L. Rev</span>. 10 (2011), Mark McKenna argues that trademark contributory
liability doctrine varies substantially from standard tort doctrine:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>the <span class=cosearchterm>secondary</span> liability
standard the Supreme Court articulated in <em><span style='font-family:Cambria'>Inwood
v. Ives </span></em>is a higher one than tort law employs. This is not
particularly surprising, both because the Supreme Court didn�t actually engage
tort cases in developing the <em><span style='font-family:Cambria'>Inwood</span></em>
standard, and because, even if it had, the most analogous tort cases involve
not <span class=cosearchterm>secondary</span> liability for the actions of
third parties, but negligence claims for unreasonably exposing the plaintiff to
harm. That is, if trademark <span class=cosearchterm>secondary</span> liability
really derived from tort law, liability would exist in cases of <span
class=cosearchterm>probabilistic</span> <span class=cosearchterm>knowledge</span>
only when the defendant unreasonably failed to take precautions in the face of
the known risk of infringement.&nbsp; Unreasonableness would be measured, as it
generally is in tort cases, by evaluating the probability of harm to the plaintiff
and the potential magnitude of that harm, and comparing the product to the cost
of the foregone precautions.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>Id</i>. at 2.&nbsp; Who would benefit (for example,
Tiffany or eBay?) if trademark law adopted the PL &gt; B approach instead of
the <i>Inwood v. Ives</i> approach to secondary liability?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>1</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci America, Inc. is a well-known manufacturer of
luxury goods. The company holds a variety of trademarks in its products and
designs, and invests substantial capital in ensuring that the marks maintain a
reputation for quality. Seeking to capitalize on the popularity of Gucci
products, certain internet merchants have sold �replica,� counterfeit Gucci
products that infringe Gucci marks at significantly lower prices and of lower
quality. Gucci recently concluded a successful litigation against one such
merchant that operated a website called TheBagAddiction.com. The owners of the
website admitted that they sold counterfeit Gucci products to customers across
the country through the website. In its continuing effort to root out and
prevent infringement of its trademarks, Gucci now brings suit against three
entities, which while a step down in the �food chain,� allegedly ensured that
TheBagAddiction.com was able to sell these counterfeit products. These
defendants allegedly established the credit card processing services used to
complete the online sales of fake Gucci items. The three defendants have
jointly moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction and for
failure to state a claim. For the reasons that follow, the defendants' motion
to dismiss is DENIED.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Centered>I. BACKGROUND</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>2</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci America, Inc. (�Plaintiff� or �Gucci�) is a
New York company, with its principal place of business in New York City. Compl.
� 11. It is the sole, exclusive distributor in the United States of items
labeled with the �Gucci Marks,� including leather goods, jewelry, home
products, and clothing. <i>Id.</i> The Gucci Marks are a series of
marks&#8212;the Gucci name, the Gucci crest, the �non-interlocking GG
monogram,� the �repeating GG design,� etc.&#8212;registered by Gucci with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. <i>See</i> Compl. �� 24&#8211;25
(reproduction of marks), Ex. 1 (Patent Office registration certificates).
According to Plaintiff, the marks are well-known and recognizable in the United
States and around the world. Gucci promotes the marks widely, and relies on
�strict quality control standards� for its products, and as a result has
achieved and retains a reputation for quality. <i>Id.</i> � 28. The company spends
hundreds of millions of dollars to advertise and promote its products and
marks, and enjoys billions in sales of the Gucci products. �Based on the
extensive sales of the Gucci [p]roducts and such products' wide popularity,�
claims Plaintiff, �the Gucci Marks have developed a secondary meaning and
significance in the minds of the purchasing public, and the services and
products utilizing and/or bearing such marks and names are immediately
identified by the purchasing public with Plaintiff.� <i>Id.</i> � 30.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>3</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> This case arises out of Plaintiff's attempts to
eliminate online sales of counterfeit products and the unauthorized use of the
Gucci Marks. In <i>Gucci America, Inc., et al. v. Laurette Company, Inc., et
al.,</i> No. 08 Civ. 5065(LAK), Gucci brought suit in this District against
certain defendants, collectively known as the �Laurette Counterfeiters� or
�Laurette,� for the sale of counterfeit Gucci products on a website called
�TheBagAddiction.com.�<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[144]</span></span></span></a>
Through this website, the Laurette Counterfeiters sold a variety of �replica�
luxury products, and, in particular, sold replica Gucci products under the
Gucci name, with the various Gucci registered trademarks, and at fractions of
the retail price for an authentic version. <i>See</i> Compl. �� 33&#8211;36
(describing and providing images of counterfeit Gucci products sold on
TheBagAddiction.com). The website itself was replete with the use of the Gucci
name and trademarks. <i>See id.</i> � 41 (image of TheBagAddiction.com
website). According to Plaintiff, the Laurette Counterfeiters �openly boasted�
about the sale of counterfeit products, because the website expressly noted
that the products were not authentic but rather �mirror images� of Gucci
products. <i>See id.</i> � 32. Though they are inferior in quality and
workmanship, they appear to the naked eye to be similar if not identical to
Gucci products. Gucci claims that, as a result of the sale of these counterfeit
products, customers were deceived and misled �into believing that the products
sold by the Laurette Counterfeiters on TheBagAddiction.com were authorized or
sponsored by the Plaintiff.� <i>Id.</i> � 40. Eventually, Laurette consented to
the entry of judgment and admitted liability for counterfeiting activities.
According to Plaintiff, �the Laurette [c]ounterfeiters admitted ... that,
without authorization or license ... they willfully and intentionally used,
reproduced and/or copied the Gucci [m]arks in connection with their
manufacturing, distributing, exporting, importing, advertising, marketing,
selling and/or offering to sell their [c]ounterfeit [p]roducts.� <i>Id.</i> �

who allegedly assisted the Laurette Counterfeiters and other similar website
operators. Durango Merchant Services (�Durango�) is a Wyoming corporation with
its business address in Durango, Colorado. According to Defendants, Durango has
only five employees, and has no offices, no employees, and no property located
in New York. Durango's business is predicated on assisting merchants in setting
up credit card processing services with institutions that provide credit card
merchant accounts. Durango does business with New York-based companies, but
maintains that this accounts for less than one percent of its revenue.
Frontline Processing Corporation (�Frontline�) is a Nevada corporation with its
principal place of business in Bozeman, Montana. Frontline is a �nationwide
provider of credit card processing and electronic payment services for
merchants, banks, and sales agents,� and is an �Independent Service
Organization� and �Merchant Service Provider� with Visa and MasterCard,
respectively. Compl. � 58. Similar to Durango, Defendants claim that Frontline
has no office, no employees, and no property in New York. A small minority of
the businesses it has worked with maintain addresses in New York. Finally, Woodforest
National Bank (�Woodforest�) is a bank organized under the laws of the United
States, with its business address in The Woodlands, Texas. Similar to
Frontline, Woodforest also �provides certain credit card processing services.� <i>Id.</i>
� 14. Like the other two defendants, Woodforest claims to have no New York
offices or property in New York, while a small percentage of its business comes
from New York-based clients. Gucci alleges that Woodforest provides some of its
services through an affiliate with an office in New York, Merchants' Choice
Card Services Corporation (�MCCS�), though Woodforest disputes the nature of
the relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>5</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> To understand the roles of the three defendants and
their alleged liability, a summary explanation of the credit card transaction
process is necessary. A customer will initiate the process when he or she
purchases a product from the merchant with a credit card. Once the credit card
information is �swiped� on a terminal, or entered on a website, the merchant
terminal transmits an authorization request to the merchant's �acquiring bank,�
who in this case was Frontline and Woodforest. The acquiring bank sends the
credit card request through an electronic network to the cardholder's issuing
bank. Based on the cardholder's credit limit or other factors, the issuing bank
will send a message back through the network to the acquiring bank, who
forwards it back to the merchant, which states that the merchant should either
approve or decline the transaction. If approved, the merchant will complete the
transaction and the acquiring bank will credit the merchant's account with the
appropriate amount of funds. This entire process typically takes a matter of
seconds. Some days to months after the sale is completed, the acquiring bank
will submit the transaction information to the issuing bank, which will seek
payment from the cardholder and settle with the acquiring bank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>6</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci's overarching theory of the case is that
Durango arranged for web companies that sold counterfeit Gucci products to
establish credit card processing services with companies like Woodforest and
Frontline. These processors then provided the credit card services necessary
for the sale of the faux Gucci items. The complaint focuses largely on the
allegedly representative conduct of Defendants with the Laurette
Counterfeiters. According to Plaintiff, Durango acted as an agent for the
defendant credit card processing companies<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[146]</span></span></span></a>
to locate potential customers, including the Laurette Counterfeiters and other
similar infringing online operations. Durango collected a referral fee for
bringing together these online merchants with banks and companies like
Frontline and Woodforest. Durango's website billed the company as specializing
in services for �High Risk Merchant Accounts,� including those who sell
�Replica Products.� Compl. � 48. <b>*239</b> Gucci alleges that the Laurette
Counterfeiters entered into a �Merchant Service Agreement� with Durango through
one of its sales representatives, Nathan Counley and, through this
relationship, �procur[ed] merchant accounts with credit card processing
agencies, including Defendants Frontline and Woodforest.� <i>Id.</i> � 51.
Gucci asserts that, through email and other documents, Durango was aware that
TheBagAddiction.com sold counterfeit �replica� Gucci products and nevertheless
chose to do business with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>7</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Frontline began to provide credit card processing
services to TheBagAddiction.com in September 2006. The relationship was
precipitated by an application completed by the Laurette Counterfeiters through
the assistance of Durango; Counley was listed as a sales agent for Frontline on
the application. <i>See</i> Compl. � 55. Once the service was established,
Frontline processed Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express credit
card transactions for goods sold by the Laurette Counterfeiters. Frontline
deducted a fee, or discount rate, based on the transactions it processed. As
part of its services, Frontline would investigate �chargebacks�&#8212;a credit
card charge that is disputed by a customer&#8212;made in connection with orders
from the website. When faced with a chargeback, Laurette allegedly gave
detailed documentation to Frontline, including a description of the item
purchased and the price that was paid. Since Frontline credited Laurette's
account after a credit card transaction was authorized, but before it received
any final payment from the issuing bank, it required Laurette to keep a
�reserve account� for chargebacks. The account allegedly totaled in excess
$40,000 by the time it was shut down in June 2008. Allegedly funded �solely
through the proceeds from counterfeit goods sold on� the website, Frontline
supposedly took possession of these funds when TheBagAddiction.com was shut
down. Gucci also alleges that Frontline charged a higher transaction fee, or
discount rate, for processing credit cards for high risk merchants, such as
�replica� merchants like the Laurette Counterfeiters. Frontline was the only
credit card processor used by the Laurette Counterfeiters for
TheBagAddiction.com from September 2006 to November 2006, and Laurette
continued to use Frontline until they were shut down in June 2008. According to
Plaintiff, Laurette's sales of counterfeit Gucci products from September 2006
to June 2008 totaled in excess of $500,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>8</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Laurette allegedly sought to do business with Woodforest
because of the high discount rate it was charged by Frontline. The Laurette
Counterfeiters applied for an account with Woodforest in November 2006; again
Counley from Durango was listed on the application, this time as Woodforest's
sales agent. <i>See</i> Compl. � 72. As part of the process, Woodforest
employees reviewed the application and completed an �Internet Merchant Review
Checklist.� The checklist required the employee to review the website and
confirm that it contained a �complete description� of the goods offered, and
pages of the website were printed in support of this review. Gucci alleges that
Woodforest, through its employee, printed a number of pages from
TheBagAddiction.com that displayed the Gucci Marks and counterfeit Gucci
products. A second-level review of the website was allegedly performed after
Woodforest accepted the application. An employee or agent would complete a
purchase on the website and request a refund; this process was repeated
regularly over the relationship with the online merchant. Woodforest began
processing credit card transactions&#8212;Visa, MasterCard and American
Express&#8212;for the Laurette Counterfeiters in November 2006, and continued
to provide these services until June 2008 when the website was shut down. Like
Frontline, Woodforest also investigated chargebacks and received relevant
documentation from Laurette, though Gucci claims that MCCS was responsible for
processing the chargeback requests. Also akin to Frontline, Woodforest charged
a higher discount rate for replica merchants like Laurette. Woodforest
allegedly processed over $1 million in transactions for counterfeit items, and
made over $30,000 from the fees on these transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>9</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci maintains that the credit card processing
services established by these three defendants was essential to the Laurette
Counterfeiters' sale of counterfeit Gucci products. These services �facilitated
the Laurette Counterfeiters ability to quickly and efficiently transact sales
for [c]ounterfeit [p]roducts through their website by enabling customers to use
personal credit cards to pay for purchases on TheBagAddiction.com.� Compl. �
87. Without credit card processing, Plaintiff claims, websites like
TheBagAddiction.com could not operate or functionally exist. As such, Gucci
believes that Durango, Frontline, and Woodforest are equally responsible for
the infringement and counterfeiting engaged in by Laurette through their
website. Based on these allegations, Plaintiff brings causes of action for (1)
trademark infringement and counterfeiting under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. ��
1114, 1125, 1116, 1117; (2) contributory trademark infringement and
counterfeiting pursuant to the Lanham Act; (3) vicarious liability for
trademark infringement and counterfeiting under the Lanham Act; and (4)
trademark infringement and unfair competition under New York state law, <i>see</i>
N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law �� 360&#8211;k, 360&#8211;o. Defendants jointly moved to
dismiss these claims based on a purported lack of personal jurisdiction, and
because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) and
(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

of liability to hold Defendants accountable for the infringing sales of
counterfeit products by others: direct, vicarious, and contributory liability.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>2. Direct and Vicarious Liability</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>12</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci has not put forth sufficient factual
allegations to support trademark infringement claims based on either direct or
vicarious theories of liability. Direct liability for trademark infringement
requires a valid mark entitled to protection under the Lanham Act, and that the
defendant used the mark in commerce in connection with the sale or advertising
of goods or services, without the plaintiff's consent. <i>1&#8211;800 Contacts,
Inc. v. WhenU.Com, Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 400, 406&#8211;07 (2d Cir.2005) (internal
quotations and citations omitted). In addition, Plaintiff must show that the
Defendant's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion. <i>Id.</i> The
problem for Gucci is that there is no indication that any of the defendants
actually �used the mark in commerce.� Knowledge alone of another party's sale
of counterfeit or infringing items is insufficient to support direct liability,
<i>see eBay,</i> 600 F.3d at 103, and there are otherwise no factual
allegations that Durango, Woodforest, or Frontline themselves advertised or
sold infringing goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>13</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci's allegations are also unable to support a
claim for vicarious liability. Vicarious trademark infringement, a theory of
liability considered elsewhere but not yet the subject of a decision by this
Circuit, �requires a finding that the defendant and the infringer have an
apparent or actual partnership, have authority to bind one another in transactions
with third parties or exercise joint ownership or control over the infringing
product.� <i>Hard Rock Cafe Licensing Corp. v. Concession Servs., Inc.,</i> 955
F.2d 1143, 1150 (7th Cir.1992); <i>Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Intern. Serv.
Ass'n,</i> 494 F.3d 788, 807 (9th Cir.2007); <i>see also Banff Ltd. v. Limited,
Inc.,</i> 869 F.Supp. 1103, 1111 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (noting lack of consideration
in Second Circuit). Though Gucci has raised a number of factual allegations
that indicate that Defendants' services were crucial to a website like
TheBagAddiction.com's sale of infringing goods, there is insufficient evidence
to plausibly infer an actual or apparent partnership. The vague, puffery-like
references to a �partnership� between these companies and website merchants are
not enough to support vicarious liability. <i>See Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A.
v. Akanoc Solutions, Inc.,</i> 591 F.Supp.2d 1098, 1113 (N.D.Cal.2008)
(�off-hand references to customers as �partners' is insufficient to exhibit the
type of behavior and relationship that can be considered an actual or apparent
partnership.�). While Defendants may have sufficient control over the sale of
counterfeit goods to support contributory liability, <i>see infra,</i> the
facts alleged do not support an inference that they had the type of control
over a company like Laurette as a whole, i.e. akin to joint ownership,
necessary for vicarious liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent><i>3. Contributory Liability</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>14</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci's only plausible theory of liability here is
contributory trademark infringement. The Supreme Court has determined that
liability can extend �beyond those who actually mislabel goods with the mark of
another.� <i>Inwood Lab., Inc. v. Ives Lab., Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 853
(1982). There, a drug manufacturer sold generic versions of a certain
brand-name drug in identically colored pill capsules, with the knowledge that
pharmacists would place the pills in brand-name packaging. In this context, the
Court held: �if a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to
infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it
knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement, the
manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm done
as a result of the deceit.� <i>Id.</i> at 853&#8211;54; <i>see also eBay,</i>
600 F.3d at 104. As the Seventh Circuit noted, however, the Supreme Court's
test for contributory liability is not as easily applied to service providers
as it is to a manufacturer. <i>See Hard Rock,</i> 955 F.2d at 1148 (�it is not
clear how the doctrine applies to people who do not actually manufacture or
distribute the good that is ultimately palmed off as made by someone else�); <i>see
also Tiffany Inc. v. eBay, Inc.,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d 463, 504 (S.D.N.Y.2008)
(reversed on other grounds). While the �intentional inducement� prong of the <i>Inwood</i>
test still applies, <i>see eBay,</i> 600 F.3d at 106, courts have crafted a
slightly different test for service providers that �continue [ ] to supply its
[services] to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark
infringement.� <i>Inwood,</i> 456 U.S. at 853. To avoid imputing liability on
truly ancillary figures like a �temporary help service� that may set up a flea
market stand for a counterfeiting merchant, <i>see Hard Rock,</i> 955 F.2d at
1148, courts in other circuits have determined that a plaintiff must also show
�direct control and monitoring of the instrumentality used by a third party to
infringe the plaintiff's mark.� <i>See, e.g., Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 807; <i>Lockheed
Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 980, 984 (9th Cir.1999).
While the Second Circuit has yet to directly contemplate the validity of this
modified part of the <i>Inwood</i> test, I concur with Judge Sullivan that this
is a �persuasive synthesis.� <i>See eBay,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 505&#8211;06. As
such, Gucci can proceed with its action against Defendants if it can show that
they (1) intentionally induced the website to infringe through the sale of
counterfeit goods or (2) knowingly supplied services to websites and had sufficient
control over infringing activity to merit liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(a) <i>Intentional Inducement</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>15</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> A party can be held liable for trademark
infringement if it intentionally induces another to engage in trademark
infringement. With regards to the role played by Durango, Plaintiff's
inducement theory is supported by sufficient factual allegations. Durango's
website reaches out to �high risk merchant accounts,� including those who sell
�replica products.� <i>Id.</i> � 48. The website further boasts that 95% of
merchant accounts are approved and that Durango �specialize[s] in hard to
acquire accounts.� <i>See</i> Coyle Decl., Ex. 10 (printed copies of Durango
website pages). Similar to the companies that promise the extension of credit
or loans to those who are rejected by traditional lending institutions for
having bad credit, Gucci's complaint suggests that Durango bills itself as a
company that sets up a certain quality of business with credit card processing
services that accept these �high risk� clients. These allegations can fairly be
construed as Durango's attempt to induce less savory businesses, like those who
sell counterfeit �replicas� of luxury goods. Moreover, Gucci alleges that
Durango's sales representative, Nathan Counley, specifically discussed
Laurette's difficulty in finding a credit card processor because they were
�replica� merchants, which Gucci argues was synonymous on the internet for a
counterfeiter.<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[148]</span></span></span></a>
Durango �communicated an inducing message to [its] ... users,� and while there
is of yet no evidence that they expressly sought out counterfeiters, Gucci has
pled sufficient facts to infer that Durango crafted �advertisement[s] or
solicitation[s] that broadcast[ ] a message designed to stimulate others to commit
violations.� <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 801 (discussing contributory
copyright infringement, but suggesting later that the analysis applies to
trademark infringement as well). Finally, Gucci alleges that Counley and
Durango helped the Laurette Counterfeiters set up a system to avoid
chargebacks, which required customers to check a box that said �I understand
these are replicas.� This suggests �affirmative steps taken to foster
infringement� or �that Defendants promoted their payment system as a means to
infringe.� <i>Id.</i> at 800&#8211;01.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>16</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> On the other hand, Gucci has failed to plausibly
support a claim that either Woodforest or Frontline intentionally induced
Laurette to sell counterfeit products. Durango, not Woodforest or Frontline,
helped set up the Laurette Counterfeiters with credit card processing services.
Though both companies allegedly advertised for high risk merchants, they did
not bring Laurette to the table the way Durango allegedly did. Gucci notes that
they both charged higher fees for processing high risk merchants, and that
Frontline reviewed the language of the aforementioned acknowledgement of
receipt of a replica product. These claims, however, are not enough to suggest
that either Woodforest or Frontline took the affirmative steps necessary to
foster infringement. <i>See Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 801.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(b) <i>Control and knowledge</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>17</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Even if a defendant does not seek out and
intentionally induce a third-party to commit trademark infringement, it may
still be held liable for the infringement if it supplied services with
knowledge or by willfully shutting its eyes to the infringing conduct, while it
had sufficient control over the instrumentality used to infringe. <i>See eBay,</i>
576 F.Supp.2d at 505&#8211;06; <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 807. Knowledge in
this context means that �a service provider must have more than a general
knowledge or reason to know that its service is being used to sell counterfeit
goods ... [s]ome contemporary knowledge of which particular listings are
infringing or will infringe in the future is necessary.� <i>eBay,</i> 600 F.3d
at 107. A showing of willful blindness to this information is also sufficient. <i>Id.</i>
at 109&#8211;10 (�When [a service provider] has reason to suspect that users of
its service are infringing a protected mark, it may not shield itself from
learning of the particular infringing transactions by looking the other way.�).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>18</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, Gucci has made substantial factual
allegations about the knowledge of all three defendants. These allegations at
the very least provide a strong inference that each knew that Laurette traded
in counterfeit products, or were willfully blind to that fact. As described
previously, Durango allegedly held itself out to high risk replica merchants.
Its sales agent, Counley, traded emails with the Laurette Counterfeiters who
expressly told him that they were unable to get credit card services because
they sold �replica� items. Counley later wrote back to say he had found a U.S.
bank that �can do replica accounts now.� Compl. � 54. Surely, a connection
between an inability to get the services needed to transact goods online and
the sale of replicas should have attracted Durango's attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>19</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Frontline likewise is alleged to have sufficient
knowledge of trademark infringement by the Laurette Counterfeiters. According
to Gucci, Laurette completed an application to obtain Frontline's services, and
Nathan Counley, though a Durango employee, is listed as Frontline's sales
agent. Counley �acted as Frontline's agent in soliciting and directing credit
card processing business from replica merchants like the Laurette
Counterfeiters� and therefore Frontline may be charged with his knowledge,
including his understanding of Laurette's difficulty to obtain services for
selling replicas. Compl. � 56. Gucci alleges that the �replica acknowledgment�
described above that was created for the Laurette website with Counley's
assistance was also reviewed by Frontline, who made suggestions as to where
they should place this warning on the website. Even more significantly,
Frontline allegedly performed its own investigation of products sold through
TheBagAddiction.com as part of Frontline's chargeback reviews. When faced with
a chargeback, Gucci claims that Frontline received supporting documentation
from Laurette that included information about the specific item ordered, including
a description of the item purchased. Not only did Frontline allegedly review
the specific item description, Plaintiff also claims that the relatively small
price tag for the item, as well as specific complaints from customers who made
chargebacks about not receiving what the website purported to sell, e.g. a
product made of genuine leather, should have alerted Frontline that these were
infringing products. These fact-specific claims are enough to at least infer
that Frontline knew or consciously avoided knowing that the counterfeit
products were sold on TheBagAddiction.com</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>20</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci claims that Woodforest's situation is similar
to Frontline. As was the case with Frontline, Counley represented himself on
Laurette's application as Woodforest's sales agent. <i>See</i> Compl. � 72. The
application itself said that Laurette was a �wholesale/retail designer [of]
handbags,� and listed the supplier as a Chinese bag manufacturer rather than
Gucci. <i>See</i> Compl., Ex. 6. Gucci also claims that Woodforest specifically
reviewed the website and the products listed on it as part of its initial
decision to do business with Laurette. A Woodforest employee allegedly
completed an �Internet Merchant Review Checklist,� which required him or her to
review the website and confirm whether it contained a complete description of
the goods offered. <i>See</i> Compl. � 75. Based on these claims and the
website images provided by Plaintiff, even a cursory review of the
TheBagAddiction.com would indicate that they claimed to sell replica Gucci
products. Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that Woodforest printed out a number of
pages that displayed goods that were for sale, including counterfeit Gucci
products, and maintained these pages as part of their business records.
Woodforest would also perform a second-level review, performed repeatedly after
it accepted the business, where an employee would complete a purchase and
request a refund. Finally, like Frontline, Woodforest investigated chargeback
disputes and received supporting documentation that allegedly should have
tipped them off to the infringing conduct. These claims are more than
sufficient to suggest, at this stage of the litigation, that Woodforest knew or
shielded themselves from the knowledge that Laurette was selling counterfeit
Gucci products with their credit card processing system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>21</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> The most significant dispute between the parties
with regard to contributory liability is whether any or all of the Defendants
had sufficient control over Laurette and TheBagAddiction.com website to render
them liable for the web merchant's counterfeiting practices. As noted above,
the control element was incorporated by the Seventh Circuit to establish a limiting
principle that would exclude those service providers that do not really
contribute to the infringing conduct; this Circuit has yet to directly consider
the merits or contours of this modified form of the <i>Inwood</i> test. <i>See
eBay,</i> 600 F.3d at 105&#8211;06 (noting control element but �assum[ing]
without deciding that <i>Inwood</i> 's test for contributory trademark
infringement governs�). Although the concept of control arose out of the flea
market context and is based on common law landlord-tenant tort principles, <i>see
Hard Rock,</i> 955 F.2d at 1149&#8211;50, the concept of control is not limited
to that context. <i>Inwood</i> �laid down no limiting principle that would
require defendant to be a manufacturer or distributor,� and �whether the venue
is online or in brick and mortar is immaterial.� <i>eBay,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at
505; <i>see also Fonovisa, Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc.,</i> 76 F.3d 259, 265
(9th Cir.1996); <i>Lockheed Martin,</i> 194 F.3d at 984. The only relevant
inquiry is the �extent of control ... over the third party's means of
infringement,� <i>eBay,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 505; <i>Lockheed Martin,</i> 194
F.3d at 984, and courts have found sufficient control in an array of service
contexts. <i>See, e.g., eBay,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 505 (online auction house); <i>Cartier

(S.D.N.Y.2003) (company that shipped goods for counterfeiter); <i>Akanoc,</i>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>22</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Here, Plaintiff provides sufficient factual
allegations to establish a claim that Woodforest and Frontline had some control
over the directly infringing third-party, but fails to provide enough facts to
show control on the part of Durango. Though Gucci has made an adequate showing
of intentional inducement by Durango, there is little indication that they had
much control over the website's sales process. Durango appears to be the
veritable middleman in this case. Though there allegedly was an ongoing
relationship between Durango and the Laurette Counterfeiters, Gucci provides
little indication that once Laurette received services from Frontline and
Woodforest, Durango had any particular ability to stop or prohibit sales.
Plaintiff's allegations suggest both inducement and knowledge, but �procuring
merchant accounts with credit card processing agencies,� Compl. � 51, does not
demonstrate that Durango could thereafter prevent the sale of any or all of the
counterfeit products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>23</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> In contrast, Gucci's complaint indicates that
Frontline and Woodforest's credit card processing services are a necessary
element for the transaction of counterfeit goods online, and were essential to
sales from TheBagAddiction.com. Although other methods of online payment exist,
such as online escrow-type services like PayPal,<a href="#_ftn149"
name="_ftnref149" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;
font-family:Cambria'>[149]</span></span></span></a> generally speaking �credit
cards serve as the primary engine of electronic commerce.� <i>Perfect 10,</i>
494 F.3d at 794. Indeed, Gucci points out that Durango's website claims that �9
out of 10 people use a credit card for their online orders.� Compl. � 3. As
such, without the credit card processing operation set up by these two
defendants, Gucci alleges that TheBagAddiction.com would largely have been
unable to sell its counterfeit Gucci products. They further support this claim
with an affidavit by one of the website owners, who states that
�[a]pproximately 99% of payments from my customers were made using credit
cards.� Kirk Decl. � 1. Both Frontline and Woodforest processed transactions
for cardholders with major credit card institutions&#8212;Visa, MasterCard, and
so forth&#8212;and, according to Gucci, Laurette sold over $500,000 in
counterfeit products �during the time they utilized Defendants' merchant
bankcard services.� Compl. � 44. By processing these transactions, both companies
allegedly earned significant revenue from the transaction fees they charged.
Put another way, �[t]hey knowingly provide a financial bridge between buyers
and sellers of [counterfeit products], enabling them to consummate infringing
transactions, while making a profit on every sale.� <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d
at 810&#8211;11 (Kozinski, J., dissenting).<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[150]</span></span></span></a>
Though both Frontline and Woodforest insist they are middlemen with no ability
to prevent a transaction, they do not dispute that they could have simply
refused to do business with �replica� internet merchants, just like the flea
market purveyor who refuses to provide a booth to a counterfeiter. <i>See</i>
Compl. �� 87&#8211;89 (Woodforest and Frontline �facilitated the Laurette
Counterfeiters ability to quickly and efficiently transact sales for
Counterfeit Products through their website by enabling customers to use
personal credit cards to pay for purchases on TheBagAddiction.com�). According
to one of the website operators, �[i]f I did not receive an approval for a
credit card charge, I would not ship the customer's order.� Kirk Decl. � 2.
These allegations indicate that the infringing products �are delivered to the
buyer only after defendants approve the transaction ... This is not just an
economic incentive for infringement; it's an essential step in the infringement
process.� <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 811&#8211;12 (Kozinski, J.,
dissenting).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>24</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Frontline and Woodforest insist that these
allegations are insufficient because they do not allege direct or complete
control over the website itself. However, the ability to literally shut down
the website is not needed given the facts of this case. The circuits that have
considered this issue look for control and monitoring over the �instrumentality
used ... to infringe the plaintiff's mark.� <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 807.
Based on Gucci's claims, the instrumentality in this case is the combination of
the website and the credit card network, since both are allegedly necessary
elements for the infringing act&#8212;the sale and distribution of the
counterfeit good.<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[151]</span></span></span></a>
Defendants' rely on the fact that, in <i>Perfect 10,</i> the Ninth Circuit
declined to hold certain credit card processors liable for a website's
trademark infringement. There, however, the infringing conduct was the
publication <i>on the website</i> of trademarked images of nude models, and the
distribution occurred via individuals viewing and taking the image directly
from the website. <i>See Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 796 (�the infringement
rests on the reproduction, alteration, display and distribution of Perfect 10's
images over the internet�); <i>Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Inter. Serv. Assoc.,</i>
No. C 04&#8211;00371, 2004 WL 3217732 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 3, 2004) (�Plaintiff
alleges that a number of websites routinely and illicitly publish Plaintiff's
images-and thereby infringe.�). Plaintiff in that case failed or perhaps was
unable to allege that the credit card service providers had the �power to
remove infringing material� or �directly stop their distribution� because the
infringement occurred on the website itself and a credit card transaction was
not needed for the website to continue to infringe. <i>See Perfect 10,</i> 494
F.3d at 807. This is not the case here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>25</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Rather, Gucci's allegations indicate that they are
concerned primarily with the sale of tangible counterfeit goods to customers
around the country, which allegedly could not be accomplished without
Woodforest and Frontline's ability to process the credit card-based purchases.
In the words of the Supreme Court, these defendants �furnish[ed] the means of
consummating� the trademark infringement. <i>See eBay,</i> 600 F.3d at 104
(quoting <i>William R. Warner &amp; Co. v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.,</i> 265 U.S.
526, 530, 44 S.Ct. 615, 68 L.Ed. 1161 (1924)). While in <i>Perfect 10</i> the
credit card services may not have been needed for a website to display
infringing photographs, the infringement here occurred through the sale of the
counterfeit products. �It's not possible to distribute by sale without
receiving compensation, so payment is in fact part of the infringement
process.� <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at 814 (Kozinski, J., dissenting). This
action resembles cases with defendants who helped consummate infringing
transactions by delivering the counterfeit or infringing goods to the customer.
In <i>Getty Petroleum Corp. v. Aris Getty, Inc.,</i> the First Circuit found a
defendant common carrier contributorily liable because it delivered unbranded
gasoline to gas stations it knew would re-sell the gasoline under the Getty
brand name. <i>See</i> 55 F.3d 718, 719 (1st Cir.1995). Lack of title to the
gasoline did not matter; the defendant �supplied[ ] an essential
factor-physical possession of the property to which the trademark was to be
attached.� <i>Id.</i> at 720. Similarly, these defendants allegedly provided an
�essential factor� to the infringement because the goods could not be sold and
shipped without their credit card services. �[I]t makes no difference that
defendants control only the means of payment, not the mechanics of transferring
the material ... In a commercial environment, distribution and payment are ...
like love and marriage-you can't have one without the other. If cards don't
process payments, pirates don't deliver booty.� <i>Perfect 10,</i> 494 F.3d at
818 (Kozinski, J., dissenting). If, as Gucci alleges, the Laurette website was
functionally dependent upon Woodforest and Frontline's credit card processing
services to sell counterfeit Gucci products, it would be sufficient to
demonstrate the control needed for liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:gray'>[</span><span style='color:gray'><span>26</span></span><span
style='color:gray'>]</span> Gucci has sufficiently alleged facts to support
personal jurisdiction and its trademark claims against Durango, Woodforest, and
Frontline. Although Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled facts to support either
direct or vicarious theories of liability, claims against all three defendants
may proceed based on a contributory liability theory. The factual allegations
are sufficient to infer that Durango intentionally induced trademark
infringement, and that Woodforest and Frontline exerted sufficient control over
the infringing transactions and knowingly provided its services to a
counterfeiter.</p>

We did not imply in <i>1&#8211;800</i> that a website can never be a trademark.
In fact, the opposite is true. <i>See</i> Trademark Manual of Examining
Procedures � 1209.03(m) (5th ed. 2007) (�A mark comprised of an Internet domain
name is registrable as a trademark or service mark only if it functions as an
identifier of the source of goods or services.�); <i>see also Two Pesos, Inc.
v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615
(1992) (Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act protects unregistered trademarks as

Med. Co., Inc. v. Pfizer Inc.,</i> 753 F.2d 208, 215&#8211;216 (2d Cir.1985)
(same). The question whether the plaintiff's website address was an
unregistered trademark was never properly before the <i>1&#8211;800</i> court
because the plaintiff did not claim that it used its website address as a
trademark.</p>

For example, instead of having a separate �sponsored links� or paid advertisement
section, search engines could allow advertisers to pay to appear at the top of
the �relevance� list based on a user entering a competitor's trademark&#8212;a
functionality that would be highly likely to cause consumer confusion.
Alternatively, sellers of products or services could pay to have the operators
of search engines automatically divert users to their website when the users
enter a competitor's trademark as a search term. Such conduct is surely not
beyond judicial review merely because it is engineered through the internal
workings of a computer program.</p>

In fact, such a holding would suggest that any time a non-holder of a trademark
uses the mark as his domain name, he would violate the Lanham Act. However,
when Congress amended the Lanham Act to add the Anticybersquatting Consumer
Protection Act, it limited violations only to situations where a person
registers the site with a bad faith intent to profit. To find a Lanham Act
violation without finding commercial use may contradict Congress' intent.</p>

The cards on which the customers of the Delaware Lottery marked their betting
choices identified the next week�s NFL football games by the names of the
cities whose NFL teams were scheduled to compete against each other (e.g.,
Washington v. Baltimore). <i>Id</i>. The parties stipulated that, in the
context in which they appeared, these geographic names were intended to refer
to, and consumers understood them to refer to, particular NFL football teams.
Id. This was enough for the court to find sponsorship or affiliation confusion
because, �[a]pparently, in this day and age when professional sports teams
franchise pennants, teeshirts, helmets, drinking glasses and a wide range of
other products, a substantial number of people believe, if not told otherwise,
that one cannot conduct an enterprise of this kind without NFL approval.� <i>Id</i>.
at 1381. The court therefore entered a limited injunction �requiring the
Lottery Director to include on Scoreboard tickets, advertising and any other
materials prepared for public distribution a clear and conspicuous statement
that Scoreboard [was] not associated with or authorized by the National
Football League.� <i>Id</i>.</p>

I also note that the survey relied upon by the majority to prove a likelihood
of confusion is fatally flawed. Generally, �[i]n assessing the likelihood of
confusion, a court's concern is �the performance of the marks in the commercial
context.� � <i>Homeowners Group, Inc. v. Home Marketing Specialists, Inc.,</i>
931 F.2d 1100, 1106 (6th Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Frisch's Restaurants, Inc. v.
Shoney's, Inc.,</i> 759 F.2d 1261, 1266 (6th Cir.1985)). �It is the overall
impression of the mark, not an individual feature, that counts.� <i>Id.</i> at
1109. Applied to the instant case, this means that the analysis must be based
on the products as they appear in the marketplace. The ultimate question is
�whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services
offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.� <i>Id.</i> at 1107.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The survey lacks any probative value on the issue of
consumer confusion because of the manner in which it was conducted. The survey
was conducted by showing photographs of Ferrari's cars and Roberts' replicas <i>stripped
of their identifying badges.</i> By conducting the survey in this manner, no
assessment could be made of the likelihood of confusion in the �commercial
context.� Purchasers of plaintiff's cars are not purchasing from photographs.
Accordingly, the survey is meaningless as to the likelihood of confusion.</p>

Indeed, some courts have simply inquired whether there exists a likelihood of
confusion between the marks, temporarily putting aside the distinction between
�direct� or �reverse� confusion until after such a likelihood has been demonstrated.
<i>See</i> <i>Americana Trading Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co.</i>, 966 F.2d
1284, 1290 (9th Cir.1992) (reversing district court grant of summary judgment
to defendants, on the ground that plaintiffs had put forth enough evidence of
�confusion�&#8212;some direct, some reverse&#8212;to create a genuine issue of

As for the copyright claim, the Ninth Circuit held that the tax treatment
General Eisenhower sought for his manuscript of the book created a triable
issue as to whether he intended the book to be a work for hire, and thus as to
whether Doubleday properly renewed the copyright in 1976. See 34 Fed.Appx., at

Under the 1946 version of the Act, � 43(a) was read as providing a cause of
action for trademark infringement even where the trademark owner had not itself
produced the goods sold under its mark, but had licensed others to sell under
its name goods produced by them&#8212;the typical franchise arrangement. See, <i>e.g.,
My Pie Int'l, Inc. v. Debould, Inc.,</i> 687 F.2d 919 (C.A.7 1982). This
stretching of the concept �origin of goods� is seemingly no longer needed: The
1988 amendments to � 43(a) now expressly prohibit the use of any �word, term,
name, symbol, or device,� or �false or misleading description of fact� that is
likely to cause confusion as to �affiliation, connection, or association ...

Nikepal's attorney attempted to convince the court that there is a
pronunciation difference between NIKE and NIKEPAL. In her questions during
trial, for example, she pronounced Nikepal's mark as �nik-a-pal.� However, in
answering her questions at trial, Mr. Sandhu, the president of Nikepal,
alternated between the pronunciation of NIKEPAL as �nik-a-pal� and as
�Ny-key-pal.� Further, Nike's witness, Joseph Sheehan, a former FBI agent and
now a private investigator, provided a tape recording of the outgoing message
heard on Nikepal's answering machine which clearly pronounced the term �Nike�
with long, or hard, vowels, that is an �i� like in �bike� and �e� like in �key�

The TDRA, signed into law on October 6, 2006, amended the previous federal
anti-dilution statute (the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (�FTDA�)). The TDRA
revises the FTDA in three ways: it establishes that likelihood of dilution, and
not actual dilution, is a prerequisite to establish a dilution claim; it sets
forth four relevant factors courts may consider in determining famousness; and
it also lists six relevant factors that courts may consider in determining
whether a likelihood of dilution exists. <i>Century 21 Real Estate LLC v.

Nike argues that the TDRA does not require that the marks be identical or

Nikepal also introduced evidence that the term �Nike� appears in dictionaries

uses were made in commerce in association with the sale or marketing of goods
or services as required under the TDRA. (<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c) (1)

factors set forth in <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp.,</i> 287

similar in kind to the <i>Polaroid</i> factors. For example, both lists include
the �similarity between� the two marks; �strength� of the mark in <i>Polaroid</i>
is akin to �distinctiveness� in � 1125; and �actual confusion� in <i>Polaroid</i>

The Supreme Court explained:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>In the February 12, 1998, edition of a weekly publication
distributed to residents of the military installation at Fort Knox, Kentucky,
petitioners advertised the �GRAND OPENING just in time for Valentine's Day!� of
their store �VICTOR'S SECRET� in nearby Elizabethtown. The ad featured
�Intimate Lingerie <i>for every woman,</i>� �Romantic Lighting�; �Lycra
Dresses�; �Pagers�; and �Adult Novelties/Gifts.� An army colonel, who saw the
ad and was offended by what he perceived to be an attempt to use a reputable
company's trademark to promote the sale of �unwholesome, tawdry merchandise,�
sent a copy to respondents. Their counsel then wrote to petitioners stating
that their choice of the name �Victor's Secret� for a store selling lingerie
was likely to cause confusion with the well-known VICTORIA'S SECRET mark and,
in addition, was likely to �dilute the distinctiveness� of the mark. They
requested the immediate discontinuance of the use of the name �and any
variations thereof.� In response, petitioners changed the name of their store
to �Victor's Little Secret.� Because that change did not satisfy respondents,
they promptly filed this action in Federal District Court.</p>

c. <i>Interests protected.</i> The antidilution statutes have been invoked
against two distinct threats to the interests of a trademark owner. First, a
mark may be so highly distinctive and so well advertised that it acts as a
powerful selling tool. Such a mark may evoke among prospective purchasers a
positive response that is associated exclusively with the goods or services of
the trademark owner. To the extent that others use the trademark to identify
different goods, services or businesses, a dissonance occurs that blurs this
stimulant effect of the mark. The antidilution statutes protect against this
dilution of the distinctiveness and selling power of the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>The selling power of a trademark also can be
undermined by a use of the mark with goods or services such as illicit drugs or
pornography that �tarnish� the mark's image through inherently negative or
unsavory associations, or with goods or services that produce a negative
response when linked in the minds of prospective purchasers with the goods or
services of the prior user, such as the use on insecticide of a trademark
similar to one previously used by another on food products.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>Tarnishment and dilution of distinctiveness, although
conceptually distinct, both undermine the selling power of a mark, the latter
by disturbing the conditioned association of the mark with the prior user and
the former by displacing positive with negative associations. Thus, tarnishment
and dilution of distinctiveness reduce the value of the mark to the trademark
owner.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>....</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><i>g. Tarnishment.</i> The antidilution statutes have
also been invoked to protect the positive associations evoked by a mark from
subsequent uses that may disparage or tarnish those associations. The rule
stated in Subsection (1)(b) applies to cases in which the tarnishment results
from a subsequent use of the mark or a substantially similar mark in a manner
that associates the mark with different goods, services, or businesses. Use of
another's mark by the actor, not as a trademark or trade name, but in other
ways that may disparage or tarnish the prior user's goods, services, business,
or mark is governed by the rule stated in Subsection (2).</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>Any designation that is distinctive under the criteria
established in � 13 is eligible for protection against disparaging or
tarnishing use by others. Whenever the subsequent use brings to mind the goods,
services, business, or mark of the prior user, there is potential for
interference with the positive images associated with the mark. To prove a case
of tarnishment, the prior user must demonstrate that the subsequent use is
likely to come to the attention of the prior user's prospective purchasers and
that the use is likely to undermine or damage the positive associations evoked
by the mark.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText><span>Illustration:</span></p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>3. <i>A,</i> a bank, uses the designation �Cookie Jar�
to identify its automatic teller machine. <i>B</i> opens a topless bar across
the street from <i>A</i> under the trade name �Cookie Jar.� Although
prospective customers of <i>A</i> are unlikely to believe that <i>A</i>
operates or sponsors the bar, <i>B</i> is subject to liability to <i>A</i> for
tarnishment under an applicable antidilution statute if the customers are
likely to associate <i>A's</i> mark or <i>A's</i> business with the images
evoked by <i>B's</i> use.</p>

I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that in
dilution-by-tarnishment cases involving new marks �with lewd or
offensive-to-some sexual association[s]� the TDRA establishes a presumption or
inference of tarnishment that the Moseleys must rebut. Maj. Op. at 389, 390. To
be sure, the House Judiciary Committee Report highlights Congress's concern
with the pre-TDRA actual-dilution standard, but I do not read its concern that
the previous standard created �an undue burden� to mean that Congress
envisioned a modification of the party that bears the burden of proof as
opposed to simply a lightening of the evidentiary showing. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep.
No. 109&#8211;23, at 5 (2005) (�Witnesses at the [ ] [legislative] hearings
focused on the standard of harm threshold articulated in <i>Moseley</i>
[sic].... The <i>Moseley</i> [sic] standard creates an undue burden for
trademark holders who contest diluting uses and should be revised.�). The
burden to show tarnishment remains with Victoria's Secret.</p>

The majority mischaracterizes my citation to the Supreme Court's decision as
evidencing a refusal to follow the �will of Congress� and a desire to follow
the pre-TDRA �policy [of the] ... Supreme Court.� Maj. Op. at 389. My citation
to the Supreme Court's decision, however, does no such thing. First, as stated
previously, I believe that the majority's conclusion that Congress intended to
change which party has the burden of proof&#8212;i.e., the framework governing
which party must put forth evidence in support of its position&#8212;as opposed
to the standard of harm&#8212;i.e., actual harm versus a likelihood of
harm&#8212;is not supported by the statute or the legislative history. In fact,
the only evidence that the majority cites in support of its belief that
Congress intended to place the burden of proof on the defendant is the House
Committee Report, but even that Report undercuts the majority's argument. The
full paragraph from which the majority draws its quotation states:</p>

<p class=Blockquote>Witnesses at the[ ] [legislative] hearings focused on the <i>standard
of harm threshold</i> articulated in <i>Moseley</i> [sic]. For example, a
representative of the International Trademark Association observed that �[b]y
the time measurable, provable damage to the mark has occurred much time has
passed, the damage has been done, and the remedy, which is injunctive relief,
is far less effective.� The Committee endorses this position. The <i>Moseley</i>
[sic] standard creates an undue burden for trademark holders who contest
diluting uses and should be revised.</p>

<p class=NormalNoIndent>H.R.Rep. No. 109&#8211;23, at 5 (internal footnote
omitted and emphasis added). It was the �standard of harm threshold,� i.e., the
showing of actual harm that the Supreme Court employed, that was Congress's
concern, not the party bearing the burden of proof. This conclusion is
supported by the hearings to which the Committee Report refers. During those
hearings, the focus of both the House Representatives and the witnesses was
whether Congress should �maintain an actual dilution standard, as the Supreme
Court held in the Victoria's Secret case,� or adopt a �likelihood of dilution
standard.� <i>Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2005: Hearing Before the
Subcomm. on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property of the H. Comm. on
the Judiciary,</i> 109th Cong. 4 (2005) (statement of Rep. Berman); <i>see
generally id.</i> at 1&#8211;54.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>I certainly recognize that Congress changed the law
concerning dilution in response to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Moseley,</i>
but the Supreme Court in <i>Moseley</i> said nothing about changing the party
bearing the burden of proof and neither does the amended statute. Instead, the
statute explicitly states that �dilution by tarnishment� is an �association
arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark <i>that
harms the reputation of the famous mark.</i>� 15 U.S.C. � 1125(c)(2)(C)
(emphasis added). In concluding that Victoria's Secret has failed to prove a
likelihood of tarnishment because it has failed to present evidence that Victor's
Little Secret is likely to harm the reputation of its mark, I am doing nothing
more than applying the plain language of the statute that Congress enacted
after the Supreme Court's decision. This approach certainly reflects the �will
of Congress.� Maj. Op. at 389.</p>

Nor can the court ignore the character of the senior mark when applying the
majority's �rule.� Victoria's Secret sells women's lingerie, and, as Victoria's
Secret readily admits, its own mark is already associated with sex, albeit not
with sex novelties. <i>See</i> ROA at 90 (Kriss Aff.) (noting that Victoria's
Secret attempts to maintain a �sexy and playful� image); <i>see also, e.g., id.</i>
at 156&#8211;57 (depicting Victoria's Secret advertisements for �sexy little
things� lingerie, which urge customers to �[b]e bad for goodness sake[ ] [i]n
peek-a-boo's, bras and sexy Santa accessories,� to �[g]ive flirty panties� as
gifts, and participate in the store's �panty fantasy,� which it describes as

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>In essence, the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark is not entirely
separate from the sexual context within which the junior mark, �Victor's Little
Secret,� operates. This fact makes the instant case unlike many of the cases
that the majority cites. <i>Cf. Williams&#8211;Sonoma, Inc. v. Friendfinder,

The potential problem with simply assuming tarnishment when the junior mark
places the senior mark in a sexual context becomes apparent if one considers a
different case. What if the holder of a sex-related senior mark levied a claim
of dilution by tarnishment against the holder of a junior mark that was
similarly associated with sex? Would the court be willing to assume without
further proof that despite their similar sexual origins the junior mark
necessarily tarnishes the senior mark? Under the majority's reasoning, such an
assumption would be appropriate. This cannot be the law.</p>

As the district court noted, although Reverend Falwell �assert [s] a claim
under 15 U.S.C. [� ] 1126 for a violation of federal unfair competition law, no
such cause of action exists. False Designation of Origin is commonly referred
to as unfair competition law....� <i>Lamparello v. Falwell,</i> 360 F.Supp.2d
768, 773 n. 2 (E.D.Va.2004). Accordingly, the district court �construed any
claim by [Falwell] for violation of federal unfair competition law as a claim
for violation of 15 U.S.C. [� ] 1125.� <i>Id.</i> We will do the same.
Furthermore, because �[t]he test for trademark infringement and unfair
competition under the Lanham Act is essentially the same as that for common law
unfair competition under Virginia law because both address the likelihood of
confusion as to the source of the goods or services involved,� <i>Lone Star
Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc.,</i> 43 F.3d 922, 930 n. 10
(4th Cir.1995), Reverend Falwell's state-law unfair competition claim rises or
falls with his federal claims of infringement and false designation of origin.
Therefore, we will not analyze his state-law claim separately.</p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Cambria'>[114]</span></span></span></a>
Indeed, Lamparello agreed at oral argument that the Lanham Act's prohibitions
on infringement and false designation apply to more than just commercial speech
as defined by the Supreme Court.</p>

If Lamparello had neither criticized Reverend Falwell by name nor expressly
rejected Reverend Falwell's teachings, but instead simply had quoted Bible
passages and offered interpretations of them subtly different from those of
Reverend Falwell, this would be a different case. For, while a gripe site, or a
website dedicated to criticism of the markholder, will seldom create a likelihood
of confusion, a website purporting to be the official site of the markholder
and, for example, articulating positions that could plausibly have come from
the markholder may well create a likelihood of confusion.</p>

Contrary to Reverend Falwell's suggestions, this rule does not change depending
on how similar the domain name or title is to the mark. Hence, Reverend
Falwell's assertion that he objects only to Lamparello using the domain name
www.fallwell.com and has no objection to Lamparello posting his criticisms at
�www.falwelliswrong.com,� or a similar domain name, does not entitle him to a
different evaluation rule. Rather it has long been established that even when
alleged infringers use the <i>very marks at issue</i> in titles, courts look to
the underlying <i>content</i> to determine whether the titles create a
likelihood of confusion as to source. <i>See, e.g., Parks v. LaFace Records,</i>

Although the appellate courts that have adopted the initial interest confusion
theory have only applied it to profit-seeking uses of another's mark, the
district courts have not so limited the application of the theory. Without
expressly referring to this theory, two frequently-discussed district court
cases have held that using another's domain name to post content antithetical
to the markholder constitutes infringement. <i>See Planned Parenthood Fed'n of
Am., Inc. v. Bucci,</i> No. 97 Civ. 0629, 1997 WL 133313 (S.D.N.Y. March 24,
1997), <i>aff'd,</i> 152 F.3d 920 (2d Cir.1998) (table) (finding use of domain
name �www.plannedparenthood.com� to provide links to passages of anti-abortion
book constituted infringement); <i>Jews for Jesus v. Brodsky,</i> 993 F.Supp.
282 (D.N.J.1998), <i>aff'd,</i> 159 F.3d 1351 (3d Cir.1998) (table) (finding
use of �www.jewsforjesus.org� to criticize religious group constituted
infringement). We think both cases were wrongly decided to the extent that in
determining whether the domain names were confusing, the courts did not
consider whether the websites' content would dispel any confusion. In expanding
the initial interest confusion theory of liability, these cases cut it off from
its moorings to the detriment of the First Amendment.</p>

discussing the ACPA, an individual cannot avoid liability for registering and
attempting to sell a hundred domain names incorporating famous marks by posting
noncommercial content at those domain names. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 106-140,
1999 WL 594571, at *14 (citing <i>Panavision Int'l v. Toeppen,</i> 141 F.3d
1316 (9th Cir.1998)). But Lamparello's sole purpose for registering
www.fallwell.com was to criticize Reverend Falwell, and this noncommercial use
was not a ruse to avoid liability. Therefore, factor IV indicates that
Lamparello did not have a bad faith intent to profit.</p>

In this case there is little evidence of seeking a free ride on Complainant's
marks at the time of registration or indeed for more than a decade thereafter.
Respondent was not until 2008 engaged in any business related to sport
footwear, and in 1997 (pre-Policy, early days of Internet commerce) short,
pithy domain names were eagerly sought (as indeed they continue to be). As
Respondent notes, the disputed domain name consists of a common slang word in
English and a dictionary word in other languages; this is not a case in which
the only reasonable inference is that Respondent chose it to target
Complainant. Respondent has provided evidence, albeit skimpy and not always
internally consistent, of actual use of the disputed domain name for a
sports-related business that had nothing to do with Complainant or
Complainant's industry.</p>

For example, �paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the auDRP requires only that a Complainant
prove that the disputed domain name �has been registered or subsequently used
in bad faith,� and the Working Group responsible for drafting it apparently did
so to avoid the consequences of proving separately bad faith in registration
and use. See &lt;www.auda.org.au/pdf/drwg-audrp-final.pdf&gt;, n4.</p>

According to the district court, �eBay took appropriate steps to warn and then
to suspend sellers when eBay learned of potential trademark infringement under
that seller's account.� <i>Tiffany,</i> 576 F.Supp.2d at 489. The district
court concluded that it was understandable that eBay did not have a
�hard-and-fast, one-strike rule� of suspending sellers because a NOCI �did not
constitute a definitive finding that the listed item was counterfeit� and
because �suspension was a very serious matter, particularly to those sellers
who relied on eBay for their livelihoods.� <i>Id.</i> The district court
ultimately found eBay's policy to be �appropriate and effective in preventing
sellers from returning to eBay and re-listing potentially counterfeit
merchandise.� <i>Id.</i></p>

The Supreme Court cited two cases in support of this proposition: <i>William R.
Warner &amp; Co. v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.,</i> 265 U.S. 526 (1924), and <i>Coca-Cola
Co. v. Snow Crest Beverages, Inc.,</i> 64 F.Supp. 980 (D.Mass.1946) (Wyzanski,
J.), <i>aff'd,</i> 162 F.2d 280 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 332 U.S. 809
(1947).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like <i>Inwood, Eli Lilly</i> involved an allegation by a
plaintiff drug manufacturer that a defendant drug manufacturer had
intentionally induced distributors to pass off the defendant's drug to purchasers
as the plaintiff's. 265 U.S. at 529-30. The Supreme Court granted the
plaintiff's request for an injunction, stating that �[o]ne who induces another
to commit a fraud and furnishes the means of consummating it is equally guilty
and liable for the injury.� <i>Id.</i> at 530-31.</p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText>In <i>Snow Crest,</i> the Coca-Cola Company claimed
that a rival soft drink maker had infringed Coca-Cola's mark because bars
purchasing the rival soft drink had substituted it for Coca-Cola when patrons
requested a �rum (or whiskey) and Coca-Cola.� 64 F.Supp. at 982, 987. Judge
Wyzanski entered judgment in favor of the defendant primarily because there was
insufficient evidence of such illicit substitutions taking place. <i>Id.</i> at
990. In doing so, the court stated that �[b]efore he can himself be held as a
wrongdoer o[r] contributory infringer one who supplies another with the
instruments by which that other commits a tort, must be shown to have knowledge
that the other will or can reasonably be expected to commit a tort with the
supplied instrument.� <i>Id.</i> at 989.</p>

European courts have done so. A Belgian court declined to hold eBay liable for
counterfeit cosmetic products sold through its website. <i>See Lanc�me v. eBay,</i>
Brussels Commercial Court (Aug. 12, 2008), Docket No. A/07/06032. French courts,

Amici do so claim. <i>See</i> Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. Amici Br. 6
(arguing that <i>Inwood</i> should �not govern where, as here, the alleged

act of direct infringement in the first place�). We decline to consider this
argument. �Although an <i>amicus</i> brief can be helpful in elaborating issues
properly presented by the parties, it is normally not a method for injecting
new issues into an appeal, at least in cases where the parties are competently

To be clear, a service provider is not contributorially liable under <i>Inwood</i>
merely for failing to anticipate that others would use its service to infringe
a protected mark. <i>Inwood,</i> 456 U.S. at 854 n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 2182 (stating
that for contributory liability to lie, a defendant must do more than
�reasonably anticipate� a third party's infringing conduct (internal quotation

was eBay here) made aware that there was infringement on its site but (unlike

The principle that willful blindness is tantamount to knowledge is hardly
novel. <i>See, e.g. Harte-Hanks Commc'ns, Inc. v. Connaughton,</i> 491 U.S.

Tiffany's reliance on the �flea market� cases, <i>Hard Rock Caf�</i> and <i>Fonovisa</i>,
is unavailing. eBay's efforts to combat counterfeiting far exceeded the efforts
made by the defendants in those cases. <i>See Hard Rock Caf�,</i> 955 F.2d at
1146 (defendant did not investigate any of the seizures of counterfeit products
at its swap meet, even though it knew they had occurred); <i>Fonovisa,</i> 76
F.3d at 265 (concluding that plaintiff stated a claim for contributory
trademark infringement based on allegation that swap meet �disregard[ed] its
vendors' blatant trademark infringements with impunity�). Moreover, neither
case concluded that the defendant was willfully blind. The court in <i>Hard
Rock Caf�</i> remanded so that the district court could apply the correct
definition of �willful blindness,� 955 F.2d at 1149, and the court in <i>Fonovisa</i>
merely sustained the plaintiff's complaint against a motion to dismiss, 76 F.3d

Defendants challenge the meaning of both �replica� and �high risk,� and claim
that both are much more innocuous terms than Gucci suggests. First, �replica�
is in fact often used in conjunction, or interchangeably, with the term
�counterfeit� in case law on trademark infringement. <i>See, e.g., Hermes Int'l
v. Lederer de Paris Fifth Ave., Inc.,</i> 219 F.3d 104, 106 (2d Cir.2000)
(�Appellees Lederer and Artbag sell replicas of various Herm�s products�); <i>eBay,</i>
600 F.3d at 100 (Defendant internet auction house has disclaimer that it �does
not tolerate� replicas); <i>Akanoc,</i> 591 F.Supp.2d at 1103 (�Plaintiff
believes that each of them is a counterfeit replica of Plaintiff's products
which infringe Plaintiff's copyrights and trademarks.�). Second, the precise
meaning of the term is a fact-specific issue that can be dealt with through
discovery, and I may rely on Gucci's pleadings at this stage of the litigation.</p>
